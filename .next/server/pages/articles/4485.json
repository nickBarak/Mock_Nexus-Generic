Clinic building. The meeting will run from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., and lunch will be provided. Stakeholders involved in I.V. — heads of local nonprofit organizations, volunteers, long-term residents, students, county representatives and Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers — will update one another on the status of their respective groups as they relate to the community. I.V. Community Network meetings are regularly held on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p>COMMUNITY CENTER<br>\nA meeting to discuss the future of the Isla Vista Community Center will be held 5 p.m. Thursday at the I.V. Clinic building. The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar and Third District County<br>\nSupervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p>PARK IT HERE<br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting 6-8 p.m. Thursday in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Co-op. The board is proposing a special election to take place in May in hopes of instituting a special tax. The board of directors regularly meets on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p>MEMORIAL GARDEN<br>\nIVRPD is having a volunteer work day starting 2 p.m. Friday for upkeep at the Isla Vista Love &amp; Remembrance Garden at People’s Park. The memorial garden was created to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014, shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p>THE WEEKEND STRETCH<br>\nLocal group Yoga Isla Vista is having an information session about becoming a yoga teacher this Sunday from 2-4 p.m. at their meeting space in 900 Embarcadero Del Mar, Suite D. They will discussing their upcoming training sessions for teaching yoga.</p>\n<p>VEGAN<br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p>MUSIC ON A MONDAY<br>\nA lineup of Isla Vista-based music groups will be performing 7-11 p.m. Monday at Biko Garage (6612 Sueno Rd). Bands playing are Feral Vida, Horse Movies, Adult School, Bearcats and On Drugs. The venue is provided by Biko Co-op House and is an all-ages, alcohol and substance-free space. As such, organizers ask that attendees “respect the space, house<br>\nmembers and what the Biko Co-op House stands for.”</p>\n<p>FREE FOOD<br>\nAs part of its Gaucho Food Program, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the I.V. Food Co-op will be tabling outside the Pardall Center on Wednesday from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. to give away free food to UCSB students. This food giveaway is regularly held every Wednesday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74799\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/vista-point-i-v-events-to-check-out-this-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74799\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/vista-point-i-v-events-to-check-out-this-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/vista-point-i-v-events-to-check-out-this-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/vista-point-i-v-events-to-check-out-this-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/vista-point-i-v-events-to-check-out-this-week/","id":4485,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4484,4483,4482],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report","biography":"Not available","articles":[1981,1982,2072,2234,2284,2351,2370,2417,2437,2512,2534,2614,2711,2733,2738,2754,2801,2827,2835,2940,2984,2992,3004,3036,3044,3090,3438,3439,3444,3450,3453,3465,3470,3471,3520,3581,3628,3655,3679,3698,3764,3776,3789,3791,3792,3794,3797,3800,3907,3958,3970,4043,4061,4134,4135,4169,4189,4190,4196,4197,4199,4213,4215,4216,4230,4232,4236,4244,4249,4250,4253,4262,4271,4277,4279,4281,4293,4294,4296,4309,4314,4315,4325,4328,4330,4343,4345,4346,4354,4364,4373,4374,4400,4405,4411,4412,4424,4425,4427,4429,4439,4446,4460,4461,4463,4468,4485,4486,4580,4635,4638,4640,4644,4702,4707,4728,4761,4777,4814,8046],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

They must raise $300,000 by the Dec. 31 deadline. <em>Courtesy of IVYP</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Youth Projects hopes to cement its role in I.V. this year by raising funds to purchase the Children’s Center building next to the Camino Real Marketplace.</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects has been serving since 1971 through four programs: the Children’s Center, the After School Program, the Family Resource Center and Thrive I.V.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Center serves children up to five years old, the After School Program serves children in kindergarten through the sixth grade, the Family Resource Center serves families of all sizes and Thrive focuses on “preparing students to enter kindergarten” and the “social-emotional component,” according to Thrive coordinator Julie Lara.</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects aims to develop their niche even further by purchasing the Children’s Center building they currently occupy at 6842 Phelps Road. To do this, they must raise $300,000 by Dec. 31 in order to qualify for an additional $300,000 block grant from Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>The Children’s Center started out as a “very small program with just 20 students,” according to Juan Pimentel, the After School Program director, but has grown to “over 100” with waiting lists for all of the programs.</p>\n<p>From an overall campaign goal of $1.9 million, $1.2 million will be directed toward the Children’s Center, according to LuAnn Miller, executive director of I.V. Youth Projects.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons why the I.V. Youth Project finds it so necessary to purchase the building is to keep costs low for the children and families who use the services provided by I.V. Youth Projects.</p>\n<p>“One of the challenges of living in Santa Barbara is the cost of living, and childcare is pretty expensive … so having a children’s center here in I.V. … at either a very low cost or on scholarship most of the time is a really great opportunity,” said Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Just like many of the students at UCSB who worry about rent increases, the I.V. Youth Projects shares those same worries about renting the space for the Children’s Center. Both Pimentel and Miller said owning the building would prevent increases in program costs and save money in the long term.</p>\n<p>“There isn’t too much money to sponsor, say, another parenting class or another need that we might see,” said Lara. By not having to allocate money for rent every month, Lara said she hopes “any funding that does come in we can use for actual programming to make our facilities better.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects will host several fundraisers over the next month, including gatherings at Woodstocks, Panda Express and Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch. The group has also teamed up with Deckers Brand for a holiday shopping event.</p>\n<p>Money is even tighter at I.V. Youth Projects due to the fact that the childcare organization is independent from any national nonprofit organization. Additionally, I.V. is an unincorporated city, so I.V. Youth Projects does not receive city funding, according to Miller.</p>\n<p>“We do have some funding from the city of Goleta and from the County of Santa Barbara,” Miller said, but the organization doesn’t have access to “a lot of the same funding revenue stream that a lot of the other nonprofits might have that are located within a city.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Youth Projects welcomes donations from any and all I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“At this point, any donation big or small helps,” Miller said. “It’s very important to us that every child, no matter where they live … deserves to have an equal access to a superior education and a good walk on life.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch fundraiser will be hosted Tuesday, Nov. 15, from 5-9 p.m. and the Panda Express fundraiser will be hosted Friday, Dec. 9, from 12-9 p.m. in the Fairview Shopping Center.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, November 3, 2016 print

The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, and Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p><strong>PARK IT HERE</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting at 6 p.m. Thursday in the IVRPD building next to the I.V.

Organizers welcome poets, musicians and comedians.</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLAH BACK</strong><br>\nUCSB Challah for Hunger hosts a bread sale from 12-2 p.m. Friday on the I.V. Food Co-op patio.

The memorial garden was to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014, shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>BUILDING A COMMUNITY</strong><br>\nThere will be another meeting to discuss the future of the Isla Vista Community Center at 1 p.m. Saturday in the I.V. Clinic building. The Isla Vista Community Development Corporation (IVCDC) will be hosting the discussion and providing lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>SOW AND REAP</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Food Co-op is hosting a gardening workshop from 12-2 p.m. Sunday on the Co-op patio.

This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>CHICKEN FOR KIDS</strong><br>\nEating dinner at Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch (149 N. Fairview Avenue) between 5-9 p.m. on Tuesday will partially benefit the Isla Vista Youth Projects. The organization is currently undergoing a campaign to raise $300,000 before the end of the year so that it may qualify for an additional $300,000 grant from the county. Isla Vista Youth Projects intends to use the $600,000 to buy their building and close phase one of their capital campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>FREE FOOD</strong><br>\nAs part of its Gaucho Food Program, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the I.V. Food Co-op will be tabling outside the Pardall Center on Wednesday from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. to give away free food to UCSB students.
