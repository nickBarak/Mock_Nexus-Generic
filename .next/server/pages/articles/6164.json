Its cavernous interior is modeled to look like a night time Spanish village, which certainly lends the place a lot of atmosphere. The rest of the theatre is clean, ornate and best of all, isn’t more expensive than any other movie theater.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Not exactly the place to watch a serious drama in. I saw “Spotlight” here, and the theatre echoed from the booming speakers and lack of audience. Definitely only come here for a blockbuster. “Ready Player One” definitely suited the place a lot better.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Buchanan Hall</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: You can go right outside to get dinner from the snack shack.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Everything else. Film students and professors alike </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loathe </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buchanan Hall. If the picture doesn’t fail, the sound does. The temperature always seems to be off. You need to slump in your seat to see the undersized, dirty screens. Seeing the original cut of “Star Wars”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in that place was truly painful. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Camino Real Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The proximity. It’s one bus ride away, and a short walk if you live around FT. The tickets are $7 on Tuesdays and there are some arcade games if you feel so inclined. The interior is very welcoming and if you need to eat afterwards, there’s a bunch of restaurants outside you can fill your belly at. I recommend the Kahuna Burger joint, if you’re feeling particularly referential.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The clientele. Generally, I’ve found that the more convenient a theater is to get to, the ruder the audience is. I had to ask a chattering couple sitting right behind me during “Infinity War” to be quiet. The boyfriend promptly told me to suck his dick and the girlfriend kept going “Sheeit!” in what sounded like a heavy Russian accent every time something happened for the next two hours.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Plaza del Oro Twin</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you’re looking for a film in limited release in Goleta, like “Brooklyn” (the only movie I ever saw there), this charming little twin theater is the place for you. It’s also right by a cafe if you’re feeling tired or hungry.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: No car? Expect to take the 11 and have to walk.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Goleta Drive-In</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The traditional passion pit experience: screenings in the dead of night in the privacy of your own car, complete with hot dogs. They even have old-as-dirt arcade games at the snack shack—the kinds you saw during commercial for Chuck-E-Cheese’s when you were in elementary school.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Leaving your car running to use the radio to hear the movie runs the risk of killing your battery.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Pollock Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: You can go see movies on the cheap that might not even be out in theaters yet, and see their cast and crew talk about them! One treasured memory of mine is seeing Steven Spielberg’s “1941” and hear one of the writers diss it. The audience is generally comprised of film students and old people, so it’s usually pretty quiet.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Food is restricted to the lobby.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The Riviera Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: I have two words for you: Dolby Atmos. Candy for the ears, ambrosia for your temporal lobes. When I went to see “Blade Runner: 2049” here, the audience was told how an audio engineer who had seen the movie 37 times said that the sonic experience at the Riviera was the best he had had yet. And how. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The theater also prides itself on showing movies that fall well outside the mainstream, such as “The King’s Choice” and Cannes darling “The Square.” So if you want to see a film that will redefine how you listen to movies, this is the place to go.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Unless you have a car, this theater is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> out-of-the-way. It’s a 20 minute hike from State Street (which is pretty much how I got most of my exercise for Fall Quarter), and even though it has this amazing sound system, don’t expect to see it paired with many blockbusters, if any. Even the Atmos can be a crux — watching “Mother!” with it was the most viscerally unpleasant experience I’ve had at the movies. Also, the snacks are few and abhorrently expensive.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>I.V. Theater</b></p>\n<p><b>Positives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There are two programs here: Free Tuesday films and Magic Lantern. The former is just how it sounds and Magic Lantern provides $4 movies on Mondays and Fridays. Occasionally, you may even catch a marathon of “Harry Potter” and “The Lord of the Rings.” Sneaking in outside food and beverages is encouraged and you can occasionally win a poster from trivia competitions. Also, if you’re a film buff, you can always talk to DJ Palladino and his students in the lobby.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negatives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If students aren’t talking behind you, they’re checking their text messages or Snapchatting scenes from the movie in front of you. On rare occasion, drunk homeless men wander in and start shouting at the screen and dropping bottles all over the place, although security will quickly remove them. The men’s bathroom is gnarly and the urinal laughs at anyone below six feet. Only one of the water fountains work.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, that’s it. That’s my guide. But before I go, let me leave off with some other general movie advice. Or rather, a plea. Because this stuff bugs me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t sneak snacks and drinks into the theater. Movie theaters get most of their money from concessions, since movie studios take most of the ticket sales. Don’t leave your trash around for the staff to pick up. Don’t send Instagrams or Snapchats or whatnot of whatever movie you’re watching and shine your phone’s light at the person sitting behind you. And for the love of god, stop exclaiming, “Oh shit!” every time something happens that surprises you. You’re in a public theater, not your living room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, I’m clocking out. Bye now.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83466\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/a-graduates-guide-to-santa-barbara-movie-theatres/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83466\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/a-graduates-guide-to-santa-barbara-movie-theatres/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/a-graduates-guide-to-santa-barbara-movie-theatres/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/a-graduates-guide-to-santa-barbara-movie-theatres/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/a-graduates-guide-to-santa-barbara-movie-theatres/","id":6164,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6163,6162,6161],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung","biography":"Not available","articles":[5768,5773,5785,5800,5801,5807,5811,5821,5830,5833,5837,5843,5844,5845,5847,5851,5864,5865,5866,5868,5871,5872,5874,5892,5895,5896,5900,5903,5904,5907,5911,5912,5914,5915,5916,5917,5918,5921,5927,5939,5940,5941,5943,5946,5951,5976,5977,5978,5999,6000,6001,6004,6016,6023,6032,6034,6062,6067,6141,6150,6154,6164,6916],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Isla Vista: Breeding Ground for Drunk, Arrogant Clones","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sagaba: To be misunderstood by the world, even by your friends at times.

It means “suffering,” according to the Blue Scholars of Seattle. And yes, I am suffering, to be perfectly honest. I feel like many among me are too, so I have the will to describe it.</p>\n<p>Living in Isla Vista, CA shouldn’t be so hard, right? Correct. Men, you should be getting laid every single weekend with any single girl of your choosing. You should be going to parties pre-gamed and pumped, you should be ready to swoop on any bitch that is dancing in her daze. Right? Of course. Pussy is pussy. And good-looking pussy is good-looking.

Look, I hate I.V. Being the strong word that it is — “hate” — I use it with caution. But I’m using it. Yes, I do hate Isla Vista and everything it usually stands for and represents. Drunk, arrogant fools walk the streets in hordes, groups and masses to do the same thing: clone each other. It’s the truth, what can I say? Every single time I go out to pick up some single girl with another full, single beer in my hand, I think, “What am I doing right now?”</p>\n<p>Well, obviously I’m trying to satisfy my body — my dick, to be more exact. Then, I think, “How important is my dick to me?”</p>\n<p>Well, it’s pretty fucking important, frankly. There’s no denying that. But then I think, “Is your mind stronger than that? Are you more than just a clone?”</p>\n<p>I respond, “Yes.” Yes, it is. My mind is stronger, and I proceed to go practically flaccid. More than a clone? Yup, I’m a bit more than that too, to tell you the truth. Then I become insecure, out of place and outnumbered. Where am I?</p>\n<p>You’re at a party, kid. And this is college, where men stand around a keg and spit the same lines and stories on weekends. You’re in college, where the easiest picking is on the dance floor; capitalize. You’re in a place where “bros” come before “hoes,” where you must say the stupidest shit to make a girl giggle enough until she feels comfortable to kiss you. Then you’re home free.</p>\n<p>These are the motions, and we all go through them regularly. Women buy this, take it home to cook, clean and fuck — more “fuck” than “cook” and “clean” — and then move on to the next weekend, the next party and the next man.</p>\n<p>“Yeeeah, buddy.” That’s where I am. Take a number and get in line.</p>\n<p>“Get me out!” I consider. “Show me someone real!” Yet, there actually isn’t an out, and there is no real. Not until you’re faded, angry and browned-out enough to walk home on your own do you realize, “I hate myself and everyone around me for this. They’re fakes and phonies that don’t deserve my attention or time. This façade I’m living isn’t living at all.”</p>\n<p>Then you realize you sound like Holden Caulfield; you realize the year is 2011.</p>\n<p>You think, “Shit, maybe I think too much. Maybe I overanalyze and criticize behavior too much,” so you chill out. You become cold and indifferent to the people and world around you. Whether at work, school or parties, you’re frosty and apathetic.</p>\n<p>“When this place has something worth showing me, I’ll pay attention,” you think. Maybe an angel will come along one day and grace you with their presence; that’s what you’ll hope for at least — an angel.</p>\n<p>But in the world of Isla Vista you’re unlikely to find her. I suppose there are plenty of angels, sure, but they’re almost all afraid and insecure like you. So much so that you’re likely to never know her.</p>\n<p>So, now what?</p>\n<p>You continue being sagaba: cold and indifferent to the world. You stay jaded and faded in the hopes that you’ll find her; in the hopes that you can find love among chaos.</p>\n<p>You might, but you might not. That’s sagaba, baby. That’s the life.</p>\n<p>Fabian Garcia is a second-year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/isla-vista-breeding-ground-drunk-arrogant-clones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/isla-vista-breeding-ground-drunk-arrogant-clones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/isla-vista-breeding-ground-drunk-arrogant-clones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/isla-vista-breeding-ground-drunk-arrogant-clones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-15/isla-vista-breeding-ground-drunk-arrogant-clones/","id":6161,"author":{"id":552,"name":"Fabian Garcia"},"related":[6160,6159,6158],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Democracy Suffers at Hands of Modern Media","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the circus!

While the amount of apathy that exists on this campus and in the U.S. in general is disheartening, how can you really blame someone for not paying attention? Politicians never seem willing to compromise or do anything productive; for most Americans, politicians are seen as bickering, corrupt, and immature. Even voting choices are commonly referred to as “the lesser of two evils.” According to a Pew Research poll from April last year, 80 percent of Americans don’t trust the federal government, a record low, and a recent Fox News poll puts Congress’ job approval rating at 10 percent, another record low.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, the catty political bickering isn’t entirely the fault of the politicians themselves. An important contributor is the intermediary between the people and their elected leaders: the media. Now while we can all argue over whether or not there is a “liberal media bias” or if Fox News is really “Fair and Balanced,” there is one undeniable truth that we all should be able to agree on — that news organizations thrive off conflict.</p>\n<p>People are much more likely to tune into coverage of “speechgate” or “the debt crisis” than compromise and agreement. Because of this, news organizations trump up and sensationalize political conflict, trying to get you to tune in and watch just long enough so that you catch a couple advertisements and make McDonald’s multi-million dollar ad deal worthwhile.</p>\n<p>The fact is, in the U.S. we have a media that is more concerned with maximizing profits than providing a public service. While that is fine for Dr. Phil and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it creates a conflict of interest for CNN, Fox and MSNBC that is a danger to effective democracy.</p>\n<p>Part of the problem can be traced back to the 90s, when Clinton signed into law a huge de-regulation of the media industry, and immediately giant media corporations like Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation gobbled up hundreds of television stations, newspapers, radio stations and movie studios. By 2000, Murdoch owned over 800 media companies in 50 countries, including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox News and the New York Post.</p>\n<p>This giant consolidation of media has created a hyper-commercialism that permeates every form of media in this country and creates an emphasis on the sensational. The result is that, instead of encouraging healthy public discussions on health care or deficit reduction by focusing on the issues themselves and how best to solve them, the cable news networks instead focus on the conflict that the issues create, which fans the flames on both sides, creating further conflict. Investigative journalism is practically nonexistent, as news networks have become more like politically charged reality TV.</p>\n<p>I had a layover in the Miami airport this summer and watched two full hours of CNN programming dedicated solely to “debt crisis coverage.” The CNN anchors gave generalized, watered-down versions of what was transpiring on Capitol Hill, followed by heated Republican and Democrat interviewees giving completely contradictory accounts of the “crisis,” then a cut to commercials and repeat. None of the news anchors or reporters questioned or challenged interviewees, even when some made completely ludicrous statements, such as presidential candidate Michele Bachmann claiming that suddenly not paying our debts would not be bad for our economy. She almost spewed more bullshit in a minute than Tiger Woods did in a lifetime, yet the news anchor just smiled and nodded.</p>\n<p>The media spoon-feeds us sensationalized conflict that provides no insight or information and instead focuses on Wiener-gate, Speech-gate, and 24-7 coverage of Sarah Palin and whatever part of U.S. history or world geography she can’t get right, and our democracy suffers because of it.</p>\n<p>Riley Schenk is tired of watching the media circus clown around with our nation’s democracy.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41148\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-22/democracy-suffers-hands-modern-media/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41148\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-22/democracy-suffers-hands-modern-media/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-22/democracy-suffers-hands-modern-media/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-22/democracy-suffers-hands-modern-media/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-22/democracy-suffers-hands-modern-media/","id":6162,"author":{"id":549,"name":"Riley Schenck"},"related":[6161,6160,6159],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Proactive Chilean Students Create a Model for Californians","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"American newspapers consistently portray the student protests in Chile as negative.

A recent article in The Daily Californian (“UC students abroad notice the impact of recent unrest,” Aug. 17, 2011) included the following comments from Berkeley student Bonnie Tung: “We would go to class, and there would be no class,” and “Some of us live in downtown (Santiago) and have had to stay at friends’ places to avoid the tear gas in that area.”</p>\n<p>As an exchange student from UCSB in my second semester at a public university in Santiago, I view this as a wonderful and unique educational opportunity. Isn’t that the most important part of studying abroad — to experience a foreign culture? Otherwise, why not stay in the comfort zone of Santa Barbara, Davis or Berkeley? It is without doubt a historic time in Chilean history, and I am overjoyed to be lucky enough to witness it firsthand. I have been fortunate to learn more outside the classroom in Santiago than inside. Every Chilean — student, parent, professor or average citizen — is current on the student protests, whether they are in accordance with them or not. They give you a history lesson beginning with the pre-Pinochet era up to the present to explain the value Chileans have for democracy. They are an incredibly informed public, far more than the majority of Americans. Even sadder, the average Chilean probably knows more about American politics than half of the American public.</p>\n<p>The complaints printed in the The Daily Cal article are not even accurate. I know I can speak for most of the “viejos” (year-long EAP Chile students in our second semester) who were around when the strikes started, when I say that there was definitely an adjustment period, but we have now come to accept it. Oh, those Chileans! While studying in a foreign place, you will be adjusting and adapting daily to the new culture around you. This is just one more adjustment that comes with the territory.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Is it possible to study abroad in Santiago? Absolutely. Even though the Chilean students are on strike, foreign students still have an obligation to go to class, as do the professors, who are not officially on strike. The majority of the faculty is still holding classes specifically for exchange students. While there definitely were — and still are — nuisances in trying to arrange semester schedules, the directors of EAP Chile and the international relations offices at the universities here are working diligently to ensure that everyone has enough credits and classes to meet their educational goals. They have added the option of research or special studies projects working with a Chilean professor to make up for classes that may have been cancelled.</p>\n<p>And, compared to California, the class size can’t be beat. When was the last time all your classes contained just two to five students? We get to know our professors on a personal level and have more flexibility in the class. Open discussion is the norm, rather than lectures, making classes more interesting and creating an affable and supportive environment for those still learning to speak Spanish. I have really come to greatly appreciate these intimate seminars.</p>\n<p>UC students could learn a lesson from the Chilean youth. UC tuition has risen more than 40 percent in the last three years. When I started college in Fall 2008, tuition averaged about $7126/year. According to UCLA’s Financial Aid Dept., it now costs $12,685 per year for in-state tuition for a public university. What happened to affordable education for everyone? Our public education system has tanked, just like Chile. Due to budget cuts, classes are being cancelled, majors and minors are being dropped and crashing over-enrolled classes is now a way of life for most UC students.</p>\n<p>But the difference is that they are actually doing something about it. The student demonstrations continue to be all about providing an affordable (or free) quality education for every Chilean. So rather than complain about the annoyances caused by the protests, take advantage of this monumental time in Chilean history and live it! Take the inconveniences with a grain of salt.  Spend your time observing how students can democratically make a difference in improving the educational system that is letting them down. I’d say “Vale la pena” (“It is worth it”) to be here and experience history in the making!</p>\n<p><em>Elena Allen is a fourth-year UCSB student studying in Santiago, Chile, through EAP.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/proactive-chilean-students-create-model-californians-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/proactive-chilean-students-create-model-californians-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/proactive-chilean-students-create-model-californians-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/proactive-chilean-students-create-model-californians-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-27/proactive-chilean-students-create-model-californians-2/","id":6163,"author":{"id":554,"name":"Elena Allen"},"related":[6162,6161,6160],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
