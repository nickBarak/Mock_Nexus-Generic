UCSB has beaten all of its opponents by double-figures during its six-game win streak.</p>\n<p>After starting the year with a conference record of 2-4, the Gauchos have matured from their rough start gaining some valuable momentum as they near the Big West Tournament. Coach Williams accredits the team’s solid play to its tough matches against Long Beach State and Hawaii early in its conference schedule.</p>\n<p>“We came out absolutely flat [for Hawaii and Long Beach],” Williams said. “We were humbled by [these losses] and have come out with a much greater sense of urgency.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson will certainly pose as a mismatch on offense for Riverside, gradually coming into his own during the Gauchos’ winning stretch.<br>\nBryson, who earned himself his second nomination as the Big West Player of the Week this year on Monday, propelled the Gauchos to victory last Saturday after scoring a team-high 19 points.</p>\n<p>Connecting from deep five times on Saturday, the fourth-year starter broke James Powell’s record for the most three-pointers in school history, moving to first all-time with 223. Bryson now has 1,523 career points, just 57 shy of seventh place all-time for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Bryson’s recent shooting stroke will enable Williams to run spread sets on offense, keeping defenses discipline beyond the arc. The 6’4” guard is currently shooting 61 percent from three in his last two games.</p>\n<p>Bryson, who leads the conference in scoring with 18.5 points per game, has scored double-figures in 25 of 26 games this season.</p>\n<p>As for Head Coach Dennis Cutts and the Highlanders, junior forward Secean Johnson will be the go-to guy on offense. After dismissing All-Big West forward Taylor Johns from the team for undisclosed team violations, Johnson has embraced a larger role for Riverside down in the post.</p>\n<p>Now seeing an increase in minutes, the junior transfer is averaging 19.0 points and 8.0 rebounds in his last two games, contest in which Johns was inactive.</p>\n<p>Johns, last season’s All-Big West First Team honoree, averaged 15.5 points and 7.5 rebounds this year for UCR.</p>\n<p>For Saturday night’s game, the Gauchos must contain seniors Reese Morgan and David Nwaba. Morgan is coming off two career games, scoring 23 points against Cal State Northridge and dropping another 22 in his senior night game against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Nwaba will be another defensive concern for UCSB. The Santa Monica College transfer led the Mustangs in their last outing against Santa Barbara, scoring a team-high 16 points to go along with nine rebounds. Look for Bryson to be matched up with the 6’4” Nwaba as he uses his frame to slash his way to the rim.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also honor seniors Sam Beeler, Mitch Brewe, T.J. Taylor, Dajuan Smith, John Green and Michael Bryson on Saturday. Williams expects an intense crowd and rowdy atmosphere to be a central component in propelling his seniors to victory.</p>\n<p>“We hope it gets rowdy [on Saturday],” Williams said. “Our seniors deserve it — they’ve had really great careers here and it’ll be great for the student body and community to pay tribute to these kids.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game begins at 7 p.m. The Blue-Green rivalry will be reignited Saturday, March 5 at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

We’ve got to be as good as we’ve been all year. Be more discipline, [against CSULB] we gave up middle drives, didn’t communicate switches, and turned the ball over too many times.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters tonight game with an overall record of 10-17, 7-6 in the Big West. The Gauchos sit at fifth in the conference standings, narrowly trailing UCD, who is currently in fourth at 8-5. UC Irvine is clinging onto its eighth-place position with its 8-22 and 1-11 conference record. It owns just one less loss than CSUF, who is 1-12 in the Big West. Cal Poly is 13-14 overall and 6-8 in Big West play for sixth-place, attempting to bounce back from its 61-56 loss to Long Beach State last night.</p>\n<p>In store for the Gauchos are two opponents with similar playing styles that revolve around their frontcourts. This week’s games will be UCSB’s second meeting against both teams. Santa Barbara will hope to establish a better defensive effort after allowing field goal percentages above 40 percent against both opponents earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Once again, UCSB will attempt to contain the interior presence of UCI’s duo of junior forwards Mokun Fajemisin and Shereen Sutherland.</p>\n<p>Fajemisin’s rebounding and blocking abilities are most challenging when facing the Anteaters. In addition to ranking fifth in the Big West in rebounds per game at 7.6, her average of 2.2 blocks per game leads the conference. Fajemisin will come into tonight’s matchup with a streak of at least two blocks in the past four consecutive games.</p>\n<p>While Sutherland’s averages of 21. 8 minutes and 7.8 points per game aren’t astounding, her versatile skillset of post offense and mid-range shooting can be difficult to defend.</p>\n<p>“[Fajemisin] really bothered us,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. “Sutherland is a really talented kid who just didn’t have much rhythm there. She got some step away [opportunities] and pulled Je Zhe away from the basket. We fouled too much. It will be important for us to pressure defensively, force tough twos, and rebound.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ended its first matchup against UCI with 24 personal fouls, sending the Anteaters to the free-throw line where they went 16-23.</p>\n<p>In just 24 minutes played, Fajemisin led the Anteaters with 16 points on 6-13 shooting from the floor while adding six rebounds, two steals and three blocks. Sutherland will look to improve her three foul performance in which she had one point at the free-throw line in 14 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Despite allowing a 40. 4 opponent field goal percentage against the Anteaters in the first meeting, UCSB recorded its third-best shooting performance of the season at 54.4 percent.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe with a career-high 20 points along with a combined 33 points from junior center Je Zhe Newton and freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the Gauchos will look to confine the Anteaters’ offense tonight, which has struggled on the road averaging just 54.1 ppg and a 32.5 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Following UCSB’s final home game, it will begin its two-game road trip at Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>In spite of falling short in the team’s Senior Day celebration last weekend, UCSB will hope to send out its senior group— Jasmine Ware, Dioseline Lopez, and Kendra Morrison— with one last victory over its Blue-Green rival.</p>\n<p>“We beat them at home, that was the first time I ever beat them in all my four years here so that was good,” Ware said. “It would be even better to beat them at home, at their place. We just have to take care of business at home, then worry about the road. From here on out its just one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ pursuit of sweeping the season series against the Mustangs will be intense as they prepare to face one of the best defenses in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly currently leads the conference in opponent field goal percentage, limiting offenses to a 37.2 average percentage.</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs’ defense has helped to stifle opponents, their offense has yet to truly discover a consistent source of scoring. However, emerging in the team’s last three game has been senior guard Beth Balbierz. She has averaged 21.0 ppg over the Mustangs’ last three contests and is second on the team in scoring with 12.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>At the forefront of Cal Poly’s offense is junior forward Hannah Gilbert in the paint. She leads the Mustangs with 13.0 ppg, is third in the Big West in rebounds per game with an 8.7 average, and is second in field goal percentage at 53.3 percent.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tip-off will take place at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome. The Gauchos will face Cal Poly this Saturday, Feb. 26 at 2 p.m. in the Robert A. Mott Athletics Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/","id":349,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[348,347,346],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Cruise Past UCI 66-37, Come Up Short in 66-60 Loss to Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_7-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team remains in the middle of the pack of the Big West Conference Standings after splitting its pair of games against UCI on Thursday and Cal Poly on Saturday.

At the helm of the Mustangs’ scoring attack in the first half was sophomore guard Dynn Leaupepe, scoring 14 of her game-high 20 points in the first two quarters. She closed out the first half with back-to-back three-pointers as she finished with 10 points in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, providing UCSB with points was guards senior Jasmine Ware and junior Onome Jemerigbe. The two combined for 16 of the Gauchos’ 24 first half points. Ware led UCSB in scoring with 14 points, while Jemerigbe concluded Saturday with 11 points and a game-high five assists. Sophomore forward Chaya Durr finished with 10 points and a game-high eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs gained their largest lead of 14-points at the 9:25 mark of the third quarter with a 40-26 lead.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the fourth quarter in which UCSB brought its deficit within single-figures. A layup by sophomore forward Taylor Farris trimmed Cal Poly’s lead to an eight-point margin of 55-47. The basket sparked UCSB’s 7-0 run, bringing the Gauchos within three, 52-55.</p>\n<p>Following a layup by Cal Poly junior forward Hannah Gilbert, Farris answered with a three-pointer to bring UCSB within its closest deficit of two points at 55-57.</p>\n<p>As the momentum gradually shifted in favor of the Gauchos, a dagger from beyond the arc by senior guard Beth Balbierz handed Cal Poly a 60-55 lead with 36 seconds remaining in the game. She was the Mustangs’ second leading scorer with 14 points on 2-3 shooting from long range.</p>\n<p>UCSB fouled the Mustangs in the game’s remaining seconds in hope of completing its combeack, but Cal Poly shot a perfect 6-6 from the free-throw line in the final quarter to secure its 66-60 victory.</p>\n<p>While a total of four different Gauchos scored double-figures in points, UCSB’s starting lineup struggled in its matchup versus UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting 42.4 percent from the field, Ware was the Gauchos only double-figure scorer with a game-high 17 points off the bench.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara didn’t have any illustrious individual performances Thursday night, its 53 rebounds was the most it recorded in a conference game this season. UCSB outrebounded UCI 53-30, helping result in the Gauchos outscoring the Anteaters 26-8 in the paint and 15-4 on second chance points.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Thursday’s victory was one of UCSB’s best defensive performances of the season as it held UC Irvine to 31.0 shooting and 14.3 three-point percentages. The Gauchos held UCI to just four points twice in the second and fourth quarters.</p>\n<p>In addition, UCSB prevented all UCI players from scoring within double-figures as the Anteaters leading scorer was freshman guard Andee Ritter.</p>\n<p>Farris tied her career-high of 13 rebounds in Thursday’s 66-37 win over UCI.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final game of the season this Thursday, Feb. 3 at Hawaii at 9 p.m. HST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68673\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68673\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/","id":350,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[349,348,347],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Ending Season at Hawaii, Possible No. 5 Seed at Stake","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_7-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In hopes of securing the No. 5 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament, the UCSB women's basketball team will hope to overcome Hawaii as the Rainbow Wahine look to lock the No. 2 seed.

We have to be able to start a game and play with that type of energy and motor to be successful.”</p>\n<p>Currently in fifth-place of the conference standings, the Gauchos enter tonight’s game with an 11-18 overall and 8-7 Big West record. Their current total of eight conference wins is the program’s most since the 2012-13 season, in which UCSB finished with 11.</p>\n<p>After nearly handing conference undefeated UCR its first league loss over the weekend, Hawaii will attempt to improve its 17-10 overall, 10-4 conference record.</p>\n<p>It’s a pivotal final two games for the Rainbow Wahine as they are currently tied with LBSU for the No. 2 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s pursuit of the No. 4 seed has deterred in the past two weeks, the Gauchos will hope to lock down the fifth seed with a win tonight and a loss by Blue-Green rival Cal Poly, who will face Hawaii this Saturday.</p>\n<p>But before Santa Barbara can look ahead to the postseason, its offense will hope to overcome its inefficient shooting start in its first matchup versus Hawaii.</p>\n<p>It begins with the Gauchos’ pair of sharpshooters—sophomore guard Makala Roper and freshman guard Coco Miller. While they each managed to sink key three-pointers in the fourth quarter of the first game, more will be expected from the two tonight.</p>\n<p>Roper ended the team’s first meeting versus Hawaii with six points on a 2-14 overall and 1-8 shooting performance while Miller went 2-9 from the field and 1-3 from beyond the arc for five points. As of recently, Roper has been plagued by turnovers, finishing with four or more in UCSB’s last four games.</p>\n<p>Both will look to shake their latest shooting slumps as well as Miller has not scored in double-figures in the last three games, while Roper has done so just once during the same span of contests.</p>\n<p>“We were really impatient and undisciplined about trying to drive it and get to the rim on the first side,” Henrickson said. “You have to make the defense move and switch sides, that’ll help both of those two. The fact that we were driving it downhill on the first side and not making the defense work that turned into bad shots and no offensive rebounds.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the majority of this season, Coach Henrickson has reassured that the Gauchos’ defense is their best source of offense. UCSB’s testament to defense will be tested tonight as it will attempt to contain senior guard/forward Destiny King.</p>\n<p>King leads the Rainbow Wahine as their only double-figure scorer averaging 10.6 points per game. She scored a game-high 17 points in the first meeting against UCSB, scoring 12 in the second half while finishing 9-12 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>Yet, it is her versatility when not shooting the ball that makes her into such a vital component for Hawaii. She also leads the team in steals with 32, is tied for the team lead in assists with 64, and is second on the team and ninth in the Big West in rebounds per game with a 6.1 average.</p>\n<p>Just last week, King became the 11<sup>th</sup> player in Hawaii program history to record career totals of 1,000 points and 500 rebounds. She is currently nine assists away from becoming the fifth Rainbow Wahine player ever to register career totals of 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, and 250 assists.</p>\n<p>“We have to match her effort and intensity on the glass and get her off the glass,” Henrickson said. “You can’t underestimate how hard she plays, you look at her free-throws, and she has 12. You’re getting to the free-throw line because you’re driving it, rebounding it, running in transition, and getting opportunities on the block. In all of those areas is where she got us.”</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara prepares to face the conference’s top rebounding team, which averages 41.8 per game, the post presence of junior center Je Zhe Newton will be important for the Gauchos at both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>In 26 minutes of play in the first matchup versus the Rainbow Wahine, Newton tallied a double-double of 12 points and 13 rebounds. However, she has not scored over three points in five of the team’s last seven games despite grabbing 12 rebounds in the Gauchos’ 58-55 loss to LBSU.</p>\n<p>“She brings size, there’s no doubt about that” Henrickson said. “She’s got to work to catch the ball and get position where she can receive the ball and finish. Certainly we have to find her; she’s got to protect the rim and defensively rebound.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final game of the season at Hawaii will tip-off at 9 p.m. PST and 7 p.m. HST</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68797\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68797\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/ucsb-set-to-end-season-at-hawaii-no-5-seed-at-stake/","id":351,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[350,349,348],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
