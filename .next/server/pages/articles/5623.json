","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has undoubtedly changed how we communicate for the better. We now have the power to reach people on the other side of the world and learn about current events almost instantly. We use texting and social media to keep in contact with acquaintances and loved ones. We send kissy-face emojis to show affection and write happy birthday on our friends’ timelines. I live hundreds of miles away from my best friends and family members, yet I feel as close to them as ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, texting and the like has also created a dimension of communication that has never existed before — a type of communication that doesn’t require any words at all. Apple has dominated the electronic world for years now. Almost every single person we know owns one an Apple phone (unless you’re a fringe Android user). Centered at the forefront of modern communication, Apple was the first to create an option to show if the person you are texting has read your message. Now, apps like Facebook and Instagram have followed this trend and automatically use read receipts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is ridiculous, I know I am not the only one who gets extremely butthurt, for lack of a better word, when I see someone has read my message and chosen to not respond. My mind starts to wander: Did I say something wrong? Should I send another text? Do they hate me? I thought we were close but I guess not…. It’s as if a switch in my mind has been turned on and I frantically worry my relationship with this person is now suddenly different. Usually, the next time I see him or her I will realize that I was over-exaggerating and that switch will be turned right back off. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mysteriousness of not knowing whether someone has just skipped over your text on accident or is purposefully ignoring you is beautiful in my eyes. Ignorance is bliss. What you don’t know can’t hurt you! It’s not worth the unnecessary headache. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a bad texter, I have never been one to use read receipts. I will read someone’s message and absorb all of the information, then completely forget to respond until five days later. Sometimes, I don’t respond on purpose. I simply just don’t have anything to say in response or get overwhelmed by the constant need to be connected with others. I want to sit with my thoughts for a couple days, or even hours, and respond when I am ready. Hypocritically, when I do this, of course it is harmless or a simple mistake. But then others do the same, I want to curl up in my room and never come out.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mind starts to wander: Did I say something wrong? Should I send another text? Do they hate me?</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read receipts are not the only confusing from of telecommunication. We’ve all received a “k.” response or interpreted a message with ten exclamation marks as overbearing and off-putting. It has been found that </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/college/2012/02/01/people-are-more-likely-to-lie-through-text-messages-study-finds/37388961/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people are much more likely to lie through text versus talking face-to-face or an audio or video chat</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The problem is that emotions cannot be interpreted as effectively without observing facial expressions and verbal tones. Read receipts reinforce this ambiguity when they leave the sender questioning what went wrong. Life was less complicated when people were forced to communicate face-to-face. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, let’s all agree that technology is confusing enough and leave read receipts behind.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ally McCulloch encourages everyone to stop obsessing over read receipts. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85873\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85873\" data-attachment-id=\"85873\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/argument-in-the-office-the-merits-of-read-receipts/img_4696/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4696\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-85873\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696-250x250.jpg?resize=396%2C396\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85873\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read receipts on messaging platforms like iMessage, WhatsApp or Facebook have become a contentious topic among users since day one. While many of my friends voice their contempt for this whole level of passive aggressive messaging, I have always appreciated the credible information of the read receipt option whether that is proof for my friend’s ignorance or the clear message of my brother’s disinterest. And let’s be honest, feeding our relationship mind games, our inner control demons just want to know whether someone has read our messages or ditched us again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a private chat, my experience is that read receipts also positively impact conversation flows and response time. Once you have opened a message your partner is notified, so you are nudged into responding instantly. Although potentially a source for misunderstandings, a read receipt is a message in itself. And it is even more effective than not replying without the function. You can now avoid uncomfortable rejections or half-hearted conversations by signalling apparent disinterest without utilizing the power of words. It is essentially the straightforward way of finally “telling” your stalking admirer to bugger off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from facilitating the inconvenient task of giving someone the brush-off, I am convinced that read receipts convey a deep feeling of community and connection. Most people underestimate the reliability in planning and the lack of the feeling of insecurity provided by the function. This applies not only to meeting your date but also in group messages when you spontaneously decide to move your party from your friend’s house to Bill’s Bus on a Thursday night. Also, who has not experienced the beauty of immediate bonding when you text someone for the first time and you see they have the read receipt function as well? I kid you not, it is just mind-blowing to feel this deep connection of living life on the same page with your fellow iPhone buddies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not want technology in general and the read receipt function in particular to control your deepest fears, you can either go on a life changing phone detox or choose options to read messages without triggering the read receipt. But let’s face it, the detox is probably just one of many new year’s resolutions we won’t fulfil this year so let’s stick to alternatives that include keeping our instruments of sin in our pockets.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although potentially a source for misunderstandings, a read receipt is a message in itself. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we are a student newspaper dedicated to improving student communication for overall happiness and love I would like to end by offering some exclusive sneaky alternatives to circumvent read receipts for y’all: First, the screen pull-down technique allows you to read texts without triggering receipts so you are not pressured to reply at all and your conversation partners are for once not crying themselves to sleep. For our bougie Tim Cook supporters, a.k.a. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">owners of an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus: You guys can use the new Peek feature to view your screen without triggering the function. You’re welcome! And now, for a change: Immerse yourself in some face-to-face conversations that render this whole messaging magic useless.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens emphasises the usefulness of read receipts but warns against taking them too seriously. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/77ba7e342d6b8818e9cdf560b4d82a29?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/77ba7e342d6b8818e9cdf560b4d82a29?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ally-mcculloch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ally McCulloch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ally McCulloch is an Opinion staff writer.

Despite their 5-3 record overall coming into this matchup, UCLA had previously won five straight games thanks to junior Mac May and her 112 kills.</p>\n<p>The Bruins continue to be one of the few teams nationwide to have only played three sets each game, but the Gauchos were able to turn the tables in this matchup with a dominating performance that led to their first victory over UCLA since 1998.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended up sweeping the Bruins (25-16, 25-16, 28-26), finishing with a season high in kill percentage (.394) and a season low number of errors (nine).</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins was yet again the most dominant player on the court.</p>\n<p>The senior outside hitter posted a monstrous 17 kills which led both teams and was also the leader in total points with 19. Ruddins has been on a tear to kick off her senior year, landing in the top-30 nationwide in both points per set and kills per set so far.</p>\n<p>While her individual success is almost expected at this point, the way that the team has produced around her is what has really been special so far.</p>\n<p>“I’m so excited for this team and for the future of this program,” Ruddins said postgame. “ I think that everyone is super dialed in to play their best, and just going out and taking it to these [top-ranked] teams.”</p>\n<p>Ruddins’ performance was not even the most intriguing storyline of the night for the Gauchos however. That distinction belonged to freshman outside hitter Tallulah Froley.</p>\n<p>The Half Moon Bay native had a career night, posting her career high in kills (15) and coming through for the team when they needed it the most.</p>\n<p>Froley closed out the first and last sets with crucial kills that guaranteed the win for UCSB, and posted an extremely efficient .667 kill percentage which she made sure to point out was partially a result of the great sets she received from her teammates.</p>\n<p>“I honestly think if I’m in the mindset of ‘just go out there and kill it,’ I’ll hopefully get [kills],” she explained. “[Setter] Olivia Lovenberg just gave me perfect opportunities and it was just fun to put away the ball.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were actually down to set-point in the last set, trailing by a score of 21-24, before roaring back to claim the set 28-26 and finish off the historic sweep.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had our backs against the wall a few times this season, even in five set matches, and that’s been good practice for us because we found ways to preservere,” Coach Welch pointed out postgame. “And it happened again tonight in a bigger moment.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, 4-6 Pepperdine come to town Friday night coming off four straight losses and will be looking to right the ship before it’s too late.</p>\n<p>UCSB has the upper hand in almost every major category, but it is the ability for teams to win the games they need to win that defines their mentality.</p>\n<p>A win over the Waves is a must if this team is to compete with 9-0 Hawai’i and stave off 7-2 Fullerton.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s seven-match win streak now puts them into a tie for the 12th best record in the nation and is their best start since 2002.</p>\n<p>After a season that saw individual efforts win some games, the Gauchos have surged up the standings 10 games in and have proven to be cold-blooded killers. With a 28-9 set record thus far, UCSB has excelled at punishing opponents early and keeping the pressure on.</p>\n<p>The upcoming match against Pepperdine will kick off at 6 p.m. on Friday night at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Sept. 19</em><em>, 2019, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

For an online exchange and public forum Facebook page like Free &amp; For Sale, it’s perfectly reasonable to take responsibility for the risks you take as a buyer. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, sometimes OBO translates directly to “I moonlight as a scam artist on Free &amp; For Sale.

The privacy of Facebook Messenger provides an interaction not unlike a silent auction: anonymous bids that push the limit to an object’s worth. A community like ours has a diverse range of socioeconomic brackets and OBO is, theoretically, a wonderful way to engage many potential buyers of varying willingness to pay with an enticing low starting price. In a stroke of serendipity, OBO works brilliantly for the online flea market that is Free &amp; For Sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While OBO has proven its practicality for Brandy Melville tube tops and seven-year-old IKEA night stands, it is inherently unethical to surge pricing on Rideshare. To me, Rideshare is about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sharing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (surprise). It’s a relatively safe way of offering your neighbor a much-appreciated seat, it’s a kind nod to the environment as you switch left to the carpool lane, but most of all, it’s a conscious act of empathy. One could have driven alone and enjoyed a few hours of mindless podcasting, but instead chose the extra hassle of picking up and dropping off people who were on their way to music festivals, long distance relationships or families. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In exchange for a ride, people chip in for gas money (although not always required), light conversation and sometimes snacks. Gas money is a fair expectation for the driver, and I support this system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a recent trip home, my roommate came back to report that a trip from Isla Vista to Los Altos could cost up to $35, with some drivers auctioning off the seats to the best offer. It was no longer a first-come, first-serve basis that operated without a discriminatory barrier to entry. Drivers who see the opportunity to make the same type of ticket sales will follow in suit. Some people simply could not afford such a ride with those drivers, and in this particular example of broken capitalism, personal gain again trumps social responsibility.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is inherently un-Gaucho-like to charge an arm and leg for a ride home out of the Thomas Fire’s pouring ashes, and it is heartless to see this profit over simple acts of kindness.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Rideshare is not a tank top, it is not a coffee table, it is not a discounted eyelash extension service. It is a helping hand, a generous deed that is returned graciously with a thankful Venmo payment or a couple of crumpled tens. I’ve had pleasant experiences with Rideshare: incredibly kind people who didn’t make me sit in the middle seat, who charged at most $25 and told me about their art project for Art 7A. They take extra precaution to drive without alarming their passengers and either already know the way or have a navigation system in place. Sometimes gum will be offered; occasionally an aux cord will be tossed into your lap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is inherently un-Gaucho-like to charge an arm and leg for a ride home out of the Thomas Fire’s pouring ashes, and it is heartless to see this profit over simple acts of kindness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As my friend Jessica said in a moment of reflection, “Rideshare drivers are the unregulated oligopolists of the Free &amp; For Sale world.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a girl picked me up in her seven-seater on my way home to the East Bay, she arranged the seating meticulously. He sits here, she sits there. It finally made sense when the girl who “agreed to sit in the seat without the seatbelt” showed up for her spot in the middle row. We paid $35 one way regardless of drop-off location as she made her way to Sacramento. The driver drove at 90 miles per hour while she navigated from an iPad in the middle console, checked texts and even picked up a phone call with one hand on the way there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, it was my decision to opt for a five-hour ride in her van instead of a 10-hour journey on Amtrak, but was it fair to ask for gas money when you could not ensure the safety of your passengers? Using GasBuddy, I calculated that her 2002 Chevy Suburban, driving 388 miles from Isla Vista to Sacramento, would cost around $78.44 for 31 gallons. I’m using GasBuddy, which gives idealistically low gas prices, so let’s say that she got unlucky with some gas station on the way, and that it cost her an even Benjamin Franklin. For the seven of us, we were charged $35 each. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was it ethical for her to ask a grand total of $245? Or am I being an ungrateful bitch? If I wanted to pay for a ride that gave me the thrill of possible imminent death, I would have preferred Six Flags. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I messaged her to cancel a return ride because of safety concerns (did I mention we knocked over a traffic drum?), she typed for a minute, paused and responded, “I wish you would have told me sooner so I could have filled the spot.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After my gentle but perhaps ungrateful reminder that we were driving on the 101 and not the Nürburgring, she replied, “By no means will you ever be subject to my driving again.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Katherine Chen wants Gauchos to help each other without green on their minds.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.

400;\">Marijuana is just as much a hallmark of the UCSB experience as Freebird’s, surfing and bike accidents. As a beach town with a laid-back surfer vibe and beautiful weather conducive to outdoor activities, Isla Vista provides the perfect backdrop for a thriving stoner culture. Smoking provides the basis for many social rituals that UCSB students would consider memorable facets of college life, from nervously blowing smoke out the window of your freshman dorm room with your new friends to lighting up a bong with housemates in your I.V. apartment as an upperclassman.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weed brings Gauchos together in a way that few other things can. If you meet a potential friend in a class or dorm hall, for example, inviting them to a smoke sesh is a designated way to transition your connection from acquaintances to buddies with a shared experience. There are recognized scripts and etiquette rules around smoking weed that make it an easy social field to navigate, where one is not constantly worried about doing or saying the right thing. At UCSB specifically, indoor spaces like privately rented apartments and outdoor spaces like the beach provide the ideal environment for stress-free seshing.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>For UCSB students, an apartment with a tapestry on the wall and a bong on the coffee table is the symbolic equivalent of a house with a trimmed lawn and white picket fence.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to its cultural significance, weed provides a relatively safe avenue for students to engage in “rebellion” as youth inevitably will in some form or another. The social contexts in which Gauchos blaze up together are relatively safe, mellow and welcoming. While alcohol is also a huge part of social life at UCSB, the parties where it is consumed are often loud and crowded, with fighting and sexual violence occurring all too frequently. I’m not saying that alcohol is the sole cause of these negative events, but there definitely is a correlation between them. Students coming together for a smoke sesh are far less likely to encounter dangerous or compromising situations than students heading out to a party on DP. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue of negative health effects always looms over the head of any stoner attempting to sway the masses, and I’m not trying to deny that these effects exist. Reduced motivation and productivity, cognitive handicaps and potential long-term damage (though research on the latter is still mostly inconclusive) are all valid concerns.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Severe damage occurs not from smoking weed, but from smoking weed excessively to the point where it gets in the way of academics and other important pursuits.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, a comparison of costs and benefits reveals that these risks are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. In my opinion, the new friendships and social rituals that weed culture facilitates at UCSB outweigh the potential dangers. Severe damage occurs not from smoking weed, but from smoking weed excessively to the point where it gets in the way of academics and other important pursuits. As long as students use it as a social activity to relax after fulfilling their responsibilities for the day, there is no cause for alarm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gauchos are situated in a unique point in life that is fully conducive to reaping the benefits of smoking weed. Adult responsibilities have not fully set in, we are surrounded by peers with whom we can engage in social smoking and we attend school in a beautiful, laid-back beach town. For UCSB students, an apartment with a tapestry on the wall and a bong on the coffee table is the symbolic equivalent of a house with a trimmed lawn and white picket fence. I would urge any student who is apprehensive of the dangers of smoking to cast those doubts aside and grab some friends, spark a joint and enjoy the exceptional stoner culture that I.V. has to offer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Laurel Rinehart wants UCSB to remain a stoner’s safe haven.</em></p>\n<h3><strong>CON: There’s More to Life Than Devil’s Lettuce</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marijuana is a pervasive part of the culture of Isla Vista, and it certainly has brought many positive experiences for UCSB students. Smoking a bowl after a hard midterm or a casual smoke sesh by the beach can be good destressors when done in moderation. That being said, there are certain problems that a culture like that can bring, and with the legalization of recreational marijuana on the horizon, these problems could end up becoming worse.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you play hard, you have to work hard, and it’s more difficult to work hard if you’re smoking every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old stereotype of stoners being more prone to laziness while high does have some truth behind it. For every person who can smoke and do their work, there are three others who get high and put off their essays, studying and responsibilities. Being students at one of the top research universities in the country, we have a duty to maintain our reputation, and people who show up to class high or don’t do their schoolwork make us all look bad and ultimately lower the value of our degrees. If you play hard, you have to work hard, and it’s more difficult to work hard if you’re smoking every day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next issue directly relates to the everyday consumption of marijuana. Most people cannot or refuse to drink alcohol every single day of the week, but for some reason, people don’t mind smoking every day. This is a moderation problem, which affects all areas of life, not just academics. I’ve heard of so many people who are avidly against driving drunk, but driving high is completely fine to them. Obviously this is hearsay evidence, but still, there’s definitely not the same stigma around driving high as there is around driving drunk. Both are extremely dangerous and can put others at risk. If you’re high every day, there will come a day when you have to drive somewhere, and since the stigma isn’t the same. you’re more likely to shrug it off and do so.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Most people cannot or refuse to drink alcohol every single day of the week, but for some reason, people don’t mind smoking every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing to consider about I.V.’s weed culture is that the very nature of the drug is beginning to change dramatically. Strains are getting more potent. Edibles are no longer hastily made by your stoner roommate but instead are professionally made into gummy bears, and rice krispy treats contain far more THC than they used to. “Dabbing,” or concentrated butane hash oil, has now become mainstream and is even available to use in nifty little vape pens that you occasionally see in Davidson during a late-night study grind. Weed is getting more potent, and it’s spreading everywhere. It is no longer confined to a late-night bong sesh in your apartment but can be consumed in the library, while casually walking the street in I.V. or while cruising through the Arbor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, if people want to light up, that’s their own prerogative and it’s their own life. The problems that are associated with marijuana all stem from a lack of moderate consumption, and if you’re capable of doing so then by all means go for it. However, we do have responsibilities as students of UCSB to be the best we can be academically. If it’s getting in the way of your grades, it’s time for a self-check on what’s important to you. The motto that we live by here is work hard, play hard, and you have to do one to earn the other.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Ali Abouesh hopes that people are careful with their doobies.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-3.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/laurelrinehart/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Laurel Rinehart</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Laurel Rinehart is a Sociology major and has been an Opinion Editor at the Daily Nexus since 2017.
