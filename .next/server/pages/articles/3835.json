The first theft was Friday, May 7 when five laptops were stolen from a residence on the 6500 block of Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>“The suspect entered into the unlocked house,” Padilla said. “I don’t believe it. These kids need to lock their doors and windows.”</p>\n<p>Several other laptops were stolen throughout the weekend. A computer was stolen from a residence on the 6700 block of Abrego Road on Saturday afternoon and two laptops were stolen from a parked car on Estero Road later that evening.</p>\n<p>On Friday afternoon another theft occurred when a suspect entered an unlocked car on the 6700 block Sabado Tarde Road and stole a laptop computer and a TomTom navigation device.</p>\n<p>Vandals also targeted a number of parked cars this weekend.</p>\n<p>Foot Patrol deputies were called to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road when an unknown suspect shattered the window of a young woman’s vehicle. Deputies also noted several reports of smashed side-view mirrors.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol deputies issued eight citations for public intoxication, in addition to 17 citations for minors in possession of alcohol and possession of open containers in public.</p>\n<p>Despite the alcohol-related crimes and high amount of thefts over the weekend, Deputy Freddy Padilla said no life-threatening incidents took place.</p>\n<p>“There were no violent crimes, nothing outrageous and, thankfully, no sexual assaults this weekend,” Padilla said. “I just hope that these kids lock their cars and houses and keep their valuables out of plain sight.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22567\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22567\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/weekend-wrap/","id":3832,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3831,3830,3829],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Where’s the Stripper Pole?

April 18, 1:57 a.m. — Deputies responded to a call on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Rd. of someone throwing eggs off a balcony at nearby cars and passersby.</p>\n<p>When officers arrived, they noted a car dripping with egg yolk just as they were welcomed by a descending egg. The 20-year-old male throwing the eggs darted inside the apartment complex as officers ran up the steps. The cops banged on the door until the resident egg-thrower finally opened up.</p>\n<p>“I’m being arrested for throwing chicken at people in the roadway, it’s just chicken, smell my fingers and my breath, this is bullshit,” he announced to the officers.</p>\n<p>After pointing out a completely empty 18-pack of extra large eggs, he continued, “I bought these eggs at the store, I can own eggs.” Officers searched the roadway for chicken or chicken bones. None were found.</p>\n<p>After blaming his escapades on “another dude,” the 20 year old refused to speak further. He was arrested and booked at Santa Barbara County Jail for his “fowl play.”</p>\n<p>The Fightin’ Freshman<br>\nSun. April 18, 12:59 a.m. — Officers responded to a call of an unconscious subject on the 6500 block of Del Playa.</p>\n<p>The male, who was supported by two friends, proved easy to spot. When the cops called out to the inebriated trio, one of the supporters nudged his friend in an effort to elicit a response but instead only caused him to fall to the ground.</p>\n<p>The officers called the paramedics before noticing the smell of alcohol wafting around a 19-year-old resident of the San Miguel Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>When a group of seven males emerged from a nearby frat house to watch the scene, the beer-soaked freshman called out, “Yeah, it’s none of your business, fuck you! Why don’t you go back inside!”</p>\n<p>The freshman and the frat boys began to exchange some heated words. The officer then told the drunken teenager he had two options — leave immediately or face arrest. Apparently looking for a fight, the first-year responded to the request by pushing the officer in the chest and shouting, “Don’t fucking touch me!”</p>\n<p>“Fuck you! Come on, do you want to go?” he asked the officer. And go they did. The deputy told the man that he was under arrest before wrestling him to the ground and handcuffing him.</p>\n<p>After hearing his Miranda rights, the forgetful freshie explained he did nothing wrong and denied any aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p>In response to his arrest, he noted, “I’ve been through this before, you guys aren’t shit!”</p>\n<p>The feisty freshman was transported to Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/","id":3834,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3833,3832,3831],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
