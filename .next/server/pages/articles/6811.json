Program Board, Extravaganza is a free annual music festival that occurs during UCSB’s Spring Quarter. First held in 1979, the event did not become a yearly tradition until 10 years later. The music festival takes place at Harder Stadium and is only open to UCSB students. This year, Extravaganza will be on Sunday, May 21 from 1-7 p.m. There are five musicians coming this year, three of which were announced yesterday at Storke Plaza. Listed below are the artists who were confirmed to be performing musical acts at this year’s Extravaganza this afternoon at Storke Plaza.</p>\n<p><strong>GRiZ</strong></p>\n<p>An electronic producer and American DJ from Michigan, Grant Kwiecinski is known to many by his stage name “GRiZ.” During his youth, Kwiecinski played alto saxophone and piano. He began to pursue his music career after deciding to drop out of Michigan State University. As a renowned artist, he integrates dubstep, hip hop, jazz and soul into his energetic tracks, referring to his music as “future funk.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The recently graduated Olés have acquired their own enticing twist on reggae and hip hop supplemented with some classic rock. The combination is typically hard to pull off, but it proves to not be a great challenge for this band. The Olés are not only verified on Spotify, but they have an overwhelming amount of supporters across the state of California. Aside from their numerous fan base, their music speaks for itself in a very humble form of musical complexity. Their California roots run deep; it is apparent in their sound, and it is what gives them the edge that most bands seek: a mixture of soft vocals and electric melodies that no other band could match. This is what drove a number of I.V. natives to jump at the chance to see them in action.<br>\nAfter recently embarking on their Southern California tour, members Matt Tweed, Cole Leksan, Daniel Kearney, Eric Lordan, Nicholas Marks, Dominick Burham and Westin Byerly made their return to the town of I.V. and were welcomed back with open arms. A Facebook invite created for the event went out before the show, and its attendees totaled nearly 1,000 people for this long-awaited concert. The buzz surrounding the show via word of mouth was immense compared to the typical talk of an Isla Vista concert or party. It is not rare for people to just come across a band they had not been anticipating in Isla Vista, but for The Olés, there was little promotion that had to be done because all of their fans were doing it for them. In the days approaching the show, it was not uncommon to be asked, “Hey, are you seeing The Olés this weekend?” or, “Yes, I saw the Facebook invite; I am definitely going!” The closer it came to the day of the show, the more the anticipation increased to finally see the band that everyone and their mother could not stop talking about.<br>\nThe show lineup included sets from Atomic Walrus, Zeek Beats &amp; Caleto and, finally, The Olés. Sueno, and of course Isla Vista in its entirety, filled with the upbeat, radiant sounds of the band that we all came to see. Like any other Saturday night, you saw drunk people flinging their limbs in rhythms they hoped came off as dancing. Everyone was in sync with each other, and while their love for The Olés poured out of their hearts and lungs, the band reciprocated the feelings by giving their all to their performance. Whether it was the fact that the guys were incredibly in tune with each other or the fact that they were playing in the heart of the town they had a great amount of love for, it was one of the most emotional performances that an Isla Vistan could experience and the band would have the opportunity to play. Sober or not, there is no forgetting the union of the glowing lights with the gray smoke in the cold night that enhanced every chord and every vocal melody. Although nothing could beat seeing them where it all began, The Olés are stopping by Velvet Jones and a few other local venues, and it would be an understatement to say that they are worth checking out. Do yourself a favor and catch them while you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68840\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68840\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/","id":6808,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6807,6806,6805],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Regrettes Bring Beach Punk to Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"You might think from my description of the show that The Regrettes is a band of veteran rockers, but you would be wrong.

Last Friday night, the L.A.-based upstarts known as The Regrettes rocked Santa Barbara with openers nucklehead and Pancho and The Wizards.<br>\nVelvet Jones holds a unique position among Santa Barbara’s great music venues. Everything about the place elevates it from a simple concert venue to a communal space for like-minded people to mosh and go insane together. There’re the rebellious red walls and lighting. There’s the black-and-white mural of a guitarist flipping off the crowd. There’s the “rock-on” gesture in the Velvet Jones logo behind the stage. It all adds up to form a very welcoming space that feels specialized in the type of community it aims to serve. When talking to fellow concertgoers, a few claimed Velvet Jones as their favorite venue. It’s intimate, but not cramped. It’s punk, but still inviting.</p>\n<p>The night began with Pancho and The Wizards, who perfectly embodied the new California beach punk skater aesthetic. The San Luis Obispo band led by their overalls-wearing frontman Tristan Cole Wildey, or Pancho, showed a lot of potential. Pancho’s vocals perfectly cut through the more noisy backing instrumentation and deliver some funny and tightly written lyrics. The band also did a great job bringing the energy throughout the set with the group’s bassist jamming out in the crowd for a portion of one of the songs. It’s easy to envision Pancho and The Wizards moving up in the punk scene here in California.</p>\n<p>Following Pancho and The Wizards was the Ventura-based punk band nucklehead. This group similarly drew inspiration from the California beach skater punk scene, but went about it a different way. While Pancho’s vocals were clear and crisp and separated themselves from the mix, nucklehead’s vocals were the opposite and utilized heavy mic reverb to create a sound that reminded me of some of the harder Descendants cuts.  As their set was wrapping up, a few audience members yelled out for one of the band’s most popular cuts, “Burrito,” which is about rushing to the toilet after a bad burrito. The crowd went nuts and the beginnings of a mosh pit that would soon envelop Velvet Jones began to form.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If you find yourself at a show at Velvet Jones on a Friday night, you might find yourself intensely hungry like I was last week. Luckily, at Velvet Jones there’s Mac N Cheese After Dark. I ordered without ever having to leave the building, but you can also order out front, where many drunk clubgoers were taking full advantage of the dish. Then, finally, the main event was here: The Regrettes.</p>\n<p>The audience packed toward the stage as the band came out. While it took a while to get going, by the third song the crowd was going nuts. Bright pastel-colored balloons were knocked about by the jumping mass of people as the moshing got more intense. The energy that filled the room felt so contagious that I rushed into the pit knowing my glasses could be destroyed with one rogue elbow — but I didn’t care. During one of the band’s best songs, “Picture Perfect,” lead singer Lydia Night came into the audience and sang the catchy-as-hell refrain with the crowd as we were all dancing. I guarantee it was the coolest thing that happened in Santa Barbara that night.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77376\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"725156750\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77375\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77376\" data-attachment-id=\"77376\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/the-regrettes-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"the regrettes\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77376\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-regrettes.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77376\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The Regrettes</p></div>\n<p>As I started getting tired, I moved to the back of the pit to get some air and saw a sound tech a mere 10 to 15 feet away from the pit precariously balancing two iPads filled with green and yellow sound monitors on one arm. I do not understand what he was thinking, but luckily for him, the pit stayed relatively contained, and by the time the infamous wall of death began a few songs later, he was gone. While you might be thinking something called the wall of death seems idiotic and reckless, which I assure you it is, it’s something I had to experience at least once. That’s the thing that makes moshing fun in the first place. I soon saw how crazy it could be when a fully-grown man got knocked to the ground beside my feet, but I soon helped him to his feet and he was back moshing. That’s what makes Velvet Jones special. You feel the community atmosphere and when a band as charismatic as The Regrettes performs, the audience will have an amazing time. I asked bassist Sage Nicole after the show how the band is able to transfer their energy to the audience so well and she said, “It’s something that came naturally, really. Once we got more used to performing, we’ve tried to play it up.”</p>\n<p>You might think from my description of the show that The Regrettes is a band of veteran rockers, but you would be wrong. None of them are even seniors in high school. That is what is perhaps most exciting about The Regrettes. They aren’t just a high school rock band, they are a fully fledged, intensely energetic band with hard-hitting punk songs and a nostalgic pop-appeal that also happen to be teenagers. As I travelled back home covered in sweat not entirely my own, I knew that all of us in that mosh pit that night had experienced something special.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77375\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77375\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/the-regrettes-bring-beach-punk-to-velvet-jones/","id":6809,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6808,6807,6806],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dawes, Dad Rock and the Modern Meaning of Genre","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-01-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Genres are, in fact, boxes; they’re compartmentalized for conveniently choosing what we want to consume in a culture constantly flooded with new music.

I saw small, disposable wine cups in almost every hand that was waiting patiently for the show to start. The intimate venue was warm and ready for the Saturday night show, simply christened “An Evening with Dawes<em>.</em>”</p>\n<p>Once the house lights went dim, Dawes walked onto the stage with an energy that was stadium-ready, silhouetted by a variety of multi-chromatic backdrops. Once the band was visible, it was clear that they were greeting the stage with comfort. Lead singer Taylor Goldsmith went right into “One of Us,” from their fifth album, <em>We’re All Gonna Die</em>. A week before the show, I had the chance to talk with drummer Griffin Goldsmith, younger brother of Taylor. Of the sharp album title, he said simply, “that general concept is applicable to anybody, anywhere.” And, as I watched the band play, I knew that was their intention: to be music for anybody, anywhere. Their brand of guitar music is quite refreshing in its sincere, unpretentious nature.</p>\n<p>A large theme in the music of Dawes, especially on their most recent effort, is acceptance. When asked of the things that he has had to accept recently, Griffin offered, “it’s nothing like ‘fuck Trump,’ it’s more just about experiences with aging, or things like that.” This, combined with the virtual absence of electronic elements in most of their catalogue, gives them an appeal to a more mature audience. Informally described as “dad rock,” some other familiar, and successful, acts that have this sound are Wilco, Ryan Adams and The National. The concertgoers that I noticed flooding the lobby of the venue and standing in lines to buy merchandise were not young and were mostly male.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Any genre prefaced by the word “dad” is bound to ruffle feathers, but the label doesn’t offend Dawes. “That’s not the most encouraging genre,” Griffin laughed. “But, I mean, that kind of stuff doesn’t offend me. I feel like all it does is allow people to categorize us, in a sense.” He then considered the genres that are generally accepted, and commonly used to describe Dawes’ sound. “We often get ‘Americana’ or ‘Laurel Canyon sound.’ I do the same thing with music I like,” he considered. “It’s fine; to put it in a box means that you like it.”</p>\n<p>Genres are, in fact, boxes; they’re compartmentalized for conveniently choosing what we want to consume in a culture constantly flooded with new music. However, some music is best created by challenging these very categories, and Dawes knows that is where the opportunity for growth lay while writing <em>We’re All Gonna Die</em>. “I think the songs made it very clear to us that this wasn’t going to be a folk record. We felt like these songs could benefit from a different approach,” Griffin explained. One of the songs, “When the Tequila Runs Out,” explores the dynamic between the familiarity of the band’s typically delicate approach to music and the heavier sound that runs throughout their new songs. The crowd raised their plastic glasses to the chorus and danced in the space between their seats and the carpeted aisles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74968\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"88473201\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74966\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74968\" data-attachment-id=\"74968\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-18/dawes-dad-rock-and-the-modern-meaning-of-genre/dawes-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?fit=2048%2C1583&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1583\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dawes\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?fit=888%2C687&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74968 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes-250x193.jpg?resize=250%2C193\" alt=\"Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=768%2C594&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=1024%2C792&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?resize=430%2C330&amp;ssl=1 430w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dawes.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74968\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Throughout both hour-long portions of the show, Dawes scattered quiet moments from earlier in their catalogue. “Now That It’s Too Late, Maria” was a particularly charming moment in the set list, with the harmonies of the Goldsmith brothers highlighting the folk ballad’s lovelorn lyrics. The brothers’ chemistry in conjunction with their other bandmates is smooth. The pounding, Fleetwood Mac-like rhythms of bassist Wylie Gelber keep the band grounded, while flourishes added by keyboardist Lee Pardini give the songs a much appreciated lightness.</p>\n<p>Dawes’ world-wise, well-traveled lyrics are built around metaphors that fill the music with warmth. A track that is a personal favorite of mine, “Time Spent in Los Angeles,” is a folk-rock gem bordering on country, about a girl who has “a special kind of sadness” because of the city that she’s spent her years in. In fact, to record their newest album, the quartet returned to Los Angeles, their hometown. The band has spent a considerable amount of time in other locales, recording albums in North Carolina and Tennessee. Their homecoming to the West Coast metropolis is perhaps what allowed for a cooler sounding record. The existential chill of “We’re All Gonna Die” filled the room with what felt like a rush of air, in comparison to the acoustic tenderness that characterizes songs like “Time Spent.”</p>\n<p>After a show that ran well over two hours, the band left the stage, only to return again for an encore. When they walked back onto the stage, they humbly received the applause that swelled below them. Earlier in the show, frontman Taylor Goldsmith mentioned that the band played the Lobero in 2013, filling only half of the room. Upon their return this year, they were playing a sold out show. Recording a total of five full-lengths in seven years and touring behind powerhouses such as Mumford and Sons, and legends such as Bob Dylan, Dawes’ work ethic is impeccable. <em>We’re All Gonna Die</em>, and the solo, multi-city tour behind it, did not push the band in a new direction, but, in fact, many different directions. Brash guitar jams, cool synth-rock and, of course, warm acoustic-folk can be found in bits and pieces throughout the album. The categories that we put artists in can, of course, stifle them. But when music transcends categories despite, or in spite, of genres, is when the best art is made.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.
