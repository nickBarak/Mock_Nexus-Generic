Last season’s postseason appearance, the first ever in school history, is a testament to the Mustang’s slow style of play. Relying on more of the same defensive tenacity this season, Cal Poly looks to exceed its predicted third-place finish in the preseason media poll.</p>\n<p>“[The style of play] has been successful a few years, I think it’s going to continue to be successful,” Callero said. “It really speaks to our commitment to defense, rebounding and being smart on the offensive end.”</p>\n<p>Leading the league in defense for the past three seasons has not come at the expense of poor offense for Cal Poly. Scoring has come by way of First-Team Big West selection, senior forward Chris Eversley. With team averages in points (14.0) and rebounds (7.2), Eversley is expected to be one of the best players in the league this year.</p>\n<p>“Chris is a First-Team All-Conference player, I think he has the chance to repeat that honor, but it also goes hand in hand with team success,” Callero said.</p>\n<p>Aside from Eversley, the tandem of wing player David Nwaba and sophomore forward Brian Bennett make up one of the strongest frontcourts in the league. Last season, Bennett shot 52.4 percent from the field and averaged 9.3 points per game, while Nwaba, despite being a transfer, is second on the team in points (11.5) and rebounds (4.5).</p>\n<p>Even with its defense and talent, Cal Poly is coming into conference play on a four-game losing skid ahead of its conference opener against Hawaii on Thursday. With a record of 4-9, the Mustangs’ biggest weakness has come when playing on the road. After Saturday’s road loss against Delaware, the team has fallen to 0-7 when away from home with all the losses coming by double digits.</p>\n<p>“We still haven’t hit our stride, and we like to hopefully play our best basketball during conference play and then during playoffs,” Callero said.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly has however notched impressive wins against Santa Clara (64-53) and Cal State Dominguez Hills (85-49). In spite of its record, Cal Poly ends its nonconference schedule first in Big West in defensive scoring (65.2) and has proven to take care of the ball, turning the ball over the least of any team in the conference (10.6).</p>\n<p>Cal Poly begins Big West play at home on Thursday against Hawaii and meets UCSB in the season’s first installment of the Blue-Green rivalry on Saturday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-poly-mens-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-poly-mens-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-poly-mens-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-poly-mens-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-poly-mens-basketball/","id":600,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[599,598,597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Big West Men’s Preview: Hawaii Men’s Basketball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hawaii.gif?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hawaii.gif?resize=544%2C396&ssl=1","description":"Hawaii looks to be a legitimate contender after finishing with the best non-conference record in the Big West this season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its second season in the Big West, the Hawaii men’s basketball team sits in first place entering conference play with a record of 11-3, and is one of the front-runners to take the top seed in the Big West Tournament after placing fifth last year.</p>\n<p>Hawaii rode a five-game winning streak through the end of November and early December, following it up with a 2-1 record in the Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Head Classic.

The 6’ 8” senior from Munich, Germany transferred to Hawaii two years ago and has been their leading scorer ever since. So far in 2013-2014, Stanhardinger has averaged 17.8 points per game, good for second in the Big West behind only Alan Williams of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>In addition to his scoring prowess, he makes an impact on the defensive end with over a block and a steal every game to go with his 7.4 rebound average. Stanhardinger was First Team All-Conference last season and was also named to the preseason All-Conference team this season.</p>\n<p>Hawaii is not a one man show however, as they also bring two more scorers in the Big West’s top-12. Garrett Nevels, a 6’2” junior guard, is averaging 13.6 points per game to go with a 2.3 assist to turnover ratio, good for seventh in conference. Nevels can score in a variety of ways, but is a long-distance specialist with the second-best three point shooting percentage in the conference at 50.9 percent.</p>\n<p>After a great freshman season, 6’8” sophomore forward Isaac Fotu also returns to the Warriors. This season, he has averaged 13.5 points per game on 58.5 percent shooting, good for sixth in conference.</p>\n<p>Fotu is also seventh in the Big West in blocks, securing his status as a dominant defensive force in the paint. Last season, Fotu was named Big West Co-Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p>Brandon Spearman rounds out Hawaii’s big four. The 6’3” senior guard averaged 14.3 points per game in Hawaii’s big wins against Oregon State and Saint Mary’s, and put up 17 in a tough one-point loss to Boise State.</p>\n<p>Spearman can score from anywhere on the floor and is averaging 11.0 points per game, even after a shaky start to the season. He was named to the All-Tournament team in the Diamond Head Classic for which he also garnered Big West Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>If Hawaii can get all four of their stars rolling at any time, it will be tough for the rest of the Big West to dethrone them from the top spot in the standings.</p>\n<p>Hawaii begins Big West play tomorrow when the Warriors travel to San Luis Obispo to take on the Cal Poly Mustangs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in page 9 of January 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-mens-preview-hawaii-mens-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-mens-preview-hawaii-mens-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-mens-preview-hawaii-mens-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-mens-preview-hawaii-mens-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-mens-preview-hawaii-mens-basketball/","id":597,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[596,595,594],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set Tone in Exhibition Win Over CSU East Bay","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wbb.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wbb.png?resize=707%2C399&ssl=1","description":"Eager to show off their new additions, the UCSB women's basketball team rolled over Cal State East Bay in its exhibition opener, 78-63.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team defeated Cal State East Bay in its exhibition opener Saturday night by a final score of 78-63.</p>\n<p>Although third-year Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson didn’t have a some of her more experienced players due to various minor injuries, a small-ball lineup featuring three freshmen brought the Gauchos energy and an array of scoring early in the game.</p>\n<p>“Good thing it was fun,” Henrickson said. “We did some good things, [there are] plenty of opportunities to grow and learn on film.

Their hot start would prove to be just that, as the Gauchos finished shooting 45.2 percent (28-62) on the night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos scoring presence also came from the three-point line, as Bates herself knocked down two threes and newcomer Tal Sahar hit four threes as part of her promising 14-point debut for UCSB. Ultimately, Santa Barbara put up 27 three-point attempts, converting on 10 to go 37 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“It felt really good, it was really nerve-wracking, you don’t play for 365 days you don’t really know how it’s going to go”, Tal explained, “But it felt really good and everyone worked really hard in practice [so] the pace didn’t really phase me as much as I thought it would.”</p>\n<p>Sahar, who sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules, showed confidence on both ends of the court and the ability to create her own shot off the dribble. Also, the 5’11 redshirt sophomore will clearly be a perimeter threat to opposing teams, forcing them to respect Sahar’s range.</p>\n<p>And when the Pioneers caught on to Sahar’s ability to easily knock down the three, the athletic guard showed a high basketball IQ in avoiding pressure, swinging the ball to get the easy bucket.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter contributed seven points on an off-night shooting, going just 2-8 and 1-6 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Senior Makala Roper used an energetic stretch in the latter part of the game to score a quick 12 points for her team.</p>\n<p>Akilah Jennings finished with 13 points and 6 boards for Santa Barbara, and fellow Gauchos Radford and Chaya Durr added a handful of buckets.</p>\n<p>Durr, a 6-foot forward, did a little bit of everything for the Gauchos, recording a team-high seven rebounds in addition to 8 points and 3 steals. The senior brought a competitive attitude and posted her diverse stat-line in only 20 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Despite a slow first half in which they only scored 22 points, the East Bay Pioneers used a game-high 25 point performance from sophomore Morgan Greene to get their offense rolling in the second half.</p>\n<p>Outscoring Santa Barbara 41-38 in the second half, East Bay controlled the boards during stretches, earning 15 points off second-chance efforts.</p>\n<p>Greene led the Pioneers with not only points but rebounds, pulling down a game-high 14 boards (6 of which were offensive).</p>\n<p>East Bay’s strong second half kept the Gauchos on their toes, but it wasn’t enough to pull off an upset, as the garbage time of the fourth quarter featured an array of bad passes, missed layups and simple turnovers from both teams.</p>\n<p>The game concluded with UCSB dribbling out the clock, and the Pioneers falling to the Gauchos in the Thunderdome. East Bay shot roughly 35 percent (23-66) from the field to go with a sub-par 26.3 percent (5-19) shooting effort from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“There’s a maturity about them, they come to work every day with a maturity and sense of urgency,” Henrickson said. “They’re silly and goofy off [the court], but when we’re between the lines they want to get it right, they want to be good, they expect to be successful, they expect to work to be successful. I think for us to play a pretty good flow and rhythm, considering so many new people… that was good.”</p>\n<p>Following the game, Coach Bonnie, Sahar, and Jennings addressed an excited group in the Founder’s Room of the Thunderdome, pointing to the revived culture of basketball Henrickson has brought to Santa Barbara in her 3rd year at the helm of the program.</p>\n<p>With plenty of energy and expectations surrounding them this year, the Gauchos will travel to open their season against Northern Arizona this Friday, November 10 at 7:00 pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79535\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79535\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-05/gauchos-set-tone-in-exhibition-win-over-csu-east-bay/","id":598,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[597,596,595],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Preview: Long Beach State Men’s Basketball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Long Beach State finished with the best regular season conference record last season and will look to do the same again this year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Long Beach State men’s basketball team will look to defend its Big West regular season title this year after finishing with a narrow one-game lead over Pacific last season.

With his first two efforts, Lamb earned Big West Player of the Week honors and solidified his spot in the starting lineup as one of the team’s go-to players.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A third straight win over the University of Nevada came after junior guard Mike Caffey hit a three-pointer at the buzzer to send the game into overtime. Caffey’s 16.9 points and 4.3 assists per game averages are both team highs.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Dan Jennings anchors the middle with averages of 11 points and eight rebounds per game, while also averaging a team high 1.3 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>Struggles on both sides of the ball have plagued the 49ers this year, as they have been outshot 39.6 percent to 45.1 percent from the field by their opponents. A meager 27.6 three-point percentage and 63.4 free throw percentage have not helped their struggles on offense, leading to their being outscored by an average of nearly eight points per game.</p>\n<p>Long Beach has turned its year around with three wins in its last four outings as it tries to forget its early season nine-game losing streak. Led on the offense by reliable and explosive guard play, the 49ers will be looking to climb above their fourth place prediction and repeat as Big West regular season champs.</p>\n<p>The 49ers begin conference play tomorrow against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-long-beach-state-mens-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-long-beach-state-mens-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-long-beach-state-mens-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-long-beach-state-mens-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-long-beach-state-mens-basketball/","id":599,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[598,597,596],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
