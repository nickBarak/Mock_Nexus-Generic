When I was offered to cover the xx show. I figured I should end summer with a bang, and I’ve followed The xx for some years now, so why not? The xx blessed the Santa Barbara Bowl Wednesday night on the “I See You” tour in support of their junior album. Since the release of their self-titled album in 2009, the band has garnered critical acclaim for their dreamy, atmospheric and minimalistic music. Whether you attentively listen to them or have just started, The xx has nonetheless earned a large and dedicated following of all ages.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78968\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78968\" data-attachment-id=\"78968\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/thexx-by-jenny-luo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TheXX by Jenny Luo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78968\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78968\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>After a really enjoyable Uber ride over to the Santa Barbara Bowl, I was anxious and slightly surprised upon my arrival. The crowd was predominantly late 20s and up, and I felt like a lost child at a concert compared to everyone else. I had a slightly rough time walking up the notorious Santa Barbara Bowl slope, and the visibly intoxicated crowd was also complaining about the hike up, making it a communal struggle.</p>\n<p>I arrived at my seat sweaty and sore, greeted by the familiar white-haired ushers and Bowl workers, who are always so kind. I had missed the opener, Perfume Genius, but a father and son sitting behind me were more than happy to share their thoughts. Concertgoer Arley Sakai said, “Spotify recommended [Perfume Genius] for me; I’ve never considered seeing them in concert … it was quite the live performance, very flamboyant and vivacious.” He explained how he had grown up listening to The xx, as his parents would play their music in the car often, and it was the minimalistic sound that really grabbed his attention.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Sitting there, I began to notice that the crowd was well into their 40s and 50s, with the GA pit looking more like they were in their 20s or 30s.

I could tell by the simple but equally elaborate stage setup that the visuals were going to be amazing. My impatience grew, so I went to withdraw cash to purchase a churro after seeing other people munching on theirs.</p>\n<p>The xx began their set, of course, with “Intro,” from their debut LP. Nostalgia rushed over me as I witnessed them perform the song that had initially brought them to my attention after hearing it on the movie “Project X.” The talented guitarist and vocalist, Romy Madley Croft, began the intro riff to “Crystalised,” and the crowd immediately responded with cheers of joy. Similar to their music style, all three members were clad in dark, simple and aesthetic sweaters, leather jackets and jeans.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Producer and DJ Jamie xx made his talent on the stage clear when they began to play “Say Something Loving’’ from their junior album. He jumped effortlessly from one side of his elevated platform to the other, playing the drums or setting up a beat for the song. Bouncing back and forth to the beats, Romy and third bandmate Oliver Sim showcased the more dance- like upbeat sound and personality of the new album; although it remains equally as minimalist as previous albums.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78970\" style=\"width: 1343px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78970\" data-attachment-id=\"78970\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/thexx-by-jenny-luo-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TheXX by Jenny Luo-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78970\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=888%2C1332\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1332\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78970\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When I was approached to cover The xx show, I had the idea it would be an enjoyable show, but what I experienced was far more than that. The xx truly grabbed and held onto the energy and enthusiasm of the crowd the whole time. The visuals transformed from monochrome to colorful displays, seemingly matching the tone of the songs playing and creating a cinematic experience throughout the Bowl. The guitar riffs, groovy bass and dream-like beats created an unforgettable atmosphere; the emotion and happiness of the crowd was at a level I had never witnessed before.</p>\n<p>The xx continued to entrance the crowd with songs off all three albums and their minimal stylistic visuals that provided an optical spectacle. Six mirror prisms rotated and lit up accordingly with the style of the song. At one point, Sim stepped off the stage, seemingly ending the show, only to reveal Jamie xx playing one of his solo songs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78969\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"876541609\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79018\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78969\" data-attachment-id=\"78969\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/thexx-by-jenny-luo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TheXX by Jenny Luo-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78969\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TheXX-by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78969\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Between the encore of “On Hold” and “Angels,” the group took a minute to announce that a dollar of each ticket sale was going to Pacific Pride. Pacific Pride is a Santa Barbara organization that provides services for AIDS/HIV and the LBGTQ community. The group also shared a message of solidarity in these troubled times, imploring the crowd to love themselves and one another. Aside from performing an immensely memorable show, they solidified my respect toward their band as a whole with that message.</p>\n<p>While walking down the treacherous SB Bowl slope, fans and friends of fans all shared their excitement over what they had just witnessed. New fans proudly showed off the band merchandise they had just purchased, longtime fans had irremovable smiles and all in all, everyone seemed to have had a good night.</p>\n<p>My Uber driver told me of the bands he got to watch at the SB Bowl back when he was younger, like Salt-N- Pepa and the Dave Matthews Band. It had me thinking about the stories I will tell of seeing bands like The xx as an adolescent. For the moment, though, I shared the Uber home with new friends, anticipating a year full of more amazing shows.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79018\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79018\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/the-xx-transcends-expectations-at-santa-barbara-bowl/","id":6829,"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez"},"related":[6828,6827,6826],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":674,"name":"Ivan Gonzalez","biography":"Not available","articles":[5783,6486,6558,6577,6584,6640,6682,6829],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Exclusive Interview: Robby Hauldren of Louis The Child","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Louis-The-Child-ill-Methodology_1-800x400.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Louis-The-Child-ill-Methodology_1-800x400.png?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Dressed in a light pink sweatshirt underneath the warmth of a Northface jacket, Robby Hauldren, one half of the up-and-coming electronic DJ duo Louis the Child, met up to chat with Artsweek.

Born and raised in the windy city of Chicago, Hauldren and his band mate Freddy Kennett started making music when they were teenagers in high school. “Freddy was making dubstep under the name ‘Fatboy,’” the Illinois native explained. “I was making mashups under the name ‘Hall Pass’ because my last name’s Haudren.”</p>\n<p>At chance meeting at a Madeon concert, the two boys became fast friends. After learning that they shared the same interest in electronic music, the new acquaintances decided to work together. By the time the aspiring artists made some real music, the two began to gain support from friends on Facebook, leading them to hire a manager who encouraged the young DJs to send their music to various online blogs. From then on, listeners on SoundCloud built huge support for the boys. With thousands of plays on their remixes, famed EDM artists such as Madeon and The Chainsmokers noticed the DJ-ing duo and asked the two to open for them on their tours.</p>\n<p>“It’s crazy because this past year, we toured with Madeon in the spring and fall. The whole ‘come full circle’ was like, we met at a Madeon concert and we got to go on tour with him.” Hauldren shared about his experience with famed EDM artist, “He has helped us out so much with incredible advice. He’s one of those people who [is] a very genuine artist who cares a lot about his craft. It’s good to get advice from him of all people.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The 19-year-old Hauldren is currently a student at University of Southern California. Kennett, who’s a year younger, plans to join his friend in Los Angeles after graduating high school this forthcoming June. Balancing being a DJ and a student simultaneously does not seem to bother the college sophomore.</p>\n<p>“I’m a student during the week and a DJ on the weekends. Every weekend on Fridays, I fly out, and Sundays, I come back and find time for my studies,” Hauldren shared.</p>\n<p>Even with a network of fans all around the world, the young music producer is shocked at the amount of recognition at his school. “I was very pleasantly surprised at going to school and meeting a lot of kids who already knew my music. It’s really eye-opening because, back in my high school, kids know my music because I go to school with them,” the USC student said. “And then to go somewhere completely different and see that all these kids from these different places also know your music and know all of our friends’ music is crazy.”</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2015, Louis the Child dropped their first original record, “It’s Strange (ft. K Flay).” The song was immediately played by millions of listeners and became a critical success. One notable fan was pop music sensation Taylor Swift, who recently shared an Instagram photo of a list of her current music obsessions. The last song on the list was none other than the duo’s debut record.</p>\n<p>“It like still hasn’t hit me. Even the fact that the thought that she even heard of our song — just that it’s gone through her ears — is crazy in itself, but then she likes it enough herself to say, like, ‘Hey, I want other people to hear this and I think it’s a song that will make your life more awesome,’ is the craziest thing,” Hauldren said.</p>\n<p>For the young artist, 2015 was the beginning of many achievements. “Overall, the success of ‘It’s Strange’ — none of us expected it to do as well as it did and it’s crazy the support that it’s gotten from our friends at blogs and our other DJ friends, and Taylor Swift and Lorde tweeting out about it. I’d say ‘It’s Strange’ is a huge highlight of 2015.” As for the coming year, the music producer is looking forward to possibly releasing a debut EP. “We got a lot more touring. We got a lot of really, really big, good festivals booked up right now that I’m super excited about,” the Chicago native shared. “We’re trying to get out an EP as soon as possible within the next couple months, so definitely an EP in early 2016 and a lot of touring and festivals.”</p>\n<p>With a headlining feature at SnowGlobe under his belt and a future performance at Coachella in the spring, Robby Hauldren is enjoying his newfound success with his best friend.

His latest project, <em>Flower Boy, </em>is a more mature offering that might signal a new style for the rapper and producer. On his new record, Tyler knows when he’s needed, and when to step back and let his production and guest singers take the spotlight. In the end, he strikes a perfect balance. While guest appearances by Kali Uchis, Rex Orange County and Frank Ocean stand out, they don’t overshadow the rapper/producer, as his vision and influence is still strongly felt throughout every track. From the silky smooth vocal performances on “See You Again,” to the hard-hitting rap-focused tracks like “I Ain’t Got Time!,” to songs that manage to integrate both seamlessly like “911 / Mr. Lonely,” this album has everything you want from a popular rap album in 2017.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OB12BslMI3Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Abysmal Thoughts</em></strong><strong>, The Drums</strong></p>\n<p>The lo-fi indie pop outfit returns with their fourth studio album, <em>Abysmal</em> <em>Thoughts</em>. After The Drums co-founder Jacob Graham left the group in 2014, frontman Jonathan Pierce found himself working alone under The Drums moniker. The result is a deeply personal album that explores Pierce’s insecurities and doubts, a record that lives up to the standards The Drums have set with their three previous albums. Singles “Blood Under My Belt” and “Heart Basel,” as well as the song “Rich Kids” stand out as some of the catchiest tracks of the summer. Overall, this album’s synth-centric, surfer rock-pop sound made it one of the standout summer soundtracks and is definitely worth a listen if you missed it.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLJ7QPuvv91JuvcguSdXZCvJz5UnF5Va4j&amp;hl=en_US\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Brick Body Kids Still Daydream</em></strong><strong>, Open Mike Eagle</strong></p>\n<p>Released just a few weeks ago on Sept. 25, <em>Brick Body Kids Still Daydream</em> is the biggest outlier among our list. Don’t expect Open Mike Eagle’s trademark humor to come through very strong on this one. There is no appearance from frequent collaborator and stand-up comedian Hannibal Buress or a song about hosting a fake late night show. Instead, the art-rapper explores subjects like gentrification, race and the normalization of the insanity of the modern day through personal experiences regarding his childhood home, the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago. The end product is an introspective tour through Eagle’s memories and unique view on the world over relatively low-key but engaging beats. While it is understated, the songs are still catchy like the sweet nostalgia of Eagle’s remembered childhood on “95 Radios” and “(How Could Anybody) Feel At Home,” in which Mike’s flow impresses over a captivating DJ Nobody instrumental with haunting flute-like synths and quick percussion. If you’re a fan of Open Mike Eagle or like your rap music more personal than showy, this is the album for you.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FCRoJaaN_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Saturation </em></strong><strong>and <em>Saturation II</em>, BROCKHAMPTON</strong></p>\n<p>The spiritual successors to Odd Future take the last two spots on our list, which we admit is sort of cheating, but the summer of 2017 was the summer of BROCKHAMPTON. Led by Kevin Abstract, the collective of over a dozen members, which began as a group of friends who met on a Kanye West fan forum, now lives up to their self-given moniker of “the Internet’s first boy band.” It’s not common for a group to release two albums of equally stellar quality back to back, but that’s the case with <em>Saturation</em> and <em>Saturation II. </em>Boasting six rappers that appear on nearly every song, each rapper of BROCKHAMPTON brings their own unique styling to each track, from Dom McLennon’s technical flow to Merlyn Wood’s manic, energetic personality, to Matt Champion’s undeniable swagger. It’s impossible not to root for these guys after watching their amateurish, handheld music videos and seeing how much fun they’re having. I haven’t even mentioned the excellent contributions from JOBA, Ameer Vann and Abstract or the extensive list of in-house producers and managers that make up the rest of the group. With the upcoming release of the group’s third album of the year, <em>Saturation III</em>, this group is just getting started. If you like bangers, Artsweek suggests “Heat,” “Gummy,” “Gold,” “Star” and “Junky” … and maybe “Swamp,” too. But actually, just listen to all of it.

This year marks the 1966 double-album’s 50th anniversary, which Old Crow Medicine Show observed by putting their own unique spin on each of its songs. The band felt a special kinship to the record, as it was recorded in their hometown of Nashville, Tenn., as well as to Dylan, with whom they collaborated to compose their hit single, “Wagon Wheel.” What’s more, the group’s album recording of their live performance of Dylan’s famous album was published by Columbia Records, the very same company that published Dylan’s original record 50 years prior. All of these links between Dylan and Old Crow Medicine Show were certainly evident in their performance, though they did not let the style of the original record constrain them to being mere imitators of Dylan; they imbued his work with their unique, often lively musical style.</p>\n<p>The group continued from Blonde on Blonde’s first track, “Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35,” to a very upbeat take on “Pledging My Time.” With this piece, they took Dylan’s march-like tune and made it more rapid with instruments such as the violin, guitar, upright bass and banjo. The band’s lead singer, Ketch Secor, went on to praise Santa Barbara, noting that he was glad to be back here and admitting good-naturedly that the city is much better than their native Nashville. The group then continued to play, all the while maintaining a comfy aesthetic of circular-brimmed hats — which Dylan is fond of himself — and the well-known Nashville music scene.</p>\n<p>A handful of the pieces that followed maintained a closer obedience to Dylan’s originals (such as “Visions of Johanna” and “Just Like a Woman”), but nonetheless kept the band’s unique sound. Their unrestrained usage of drums and upright bass yielded a bouncier and quicker style than Dylan’s, which prompted many of the songs to give an entirely different experience. Interestingly, in this they stayed true to Dylan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false;

A couple of the tunes were sung by members of the band other than Secor. For instance, Critter Fuqua took over for “One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)” as well as “I Want You.” For the latter of these, Critter elaborated on the country aesthetic the group felt the original had, yielding an almost completely different tune. However, perhaps the most exciting change in primary vocalist was when Kevin Hayes took the microphone for his interpretation of “Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat.”</p>\n<p>For this piece, Hayes gripped a wireless microphone and memorably danced and shimmied across the stage. He may have been the most active member to sing the lead vocals, and he created an extremely cheerful experience for the audience. With his quick, passionate movements, he physically expressed the lively sound of nearly all of the group’s pieces. In fact, all of the members were completely immersed in their performance; Secor’s face trembled with the passion of the lyrics his sung, for example.</p>\n<p>“Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat” signaled a new wave of intense enthusiasm among the audience. After “Just Like a Woman,” which Secor termed a “California-type song,” the theater erupted in applause and cheering, and the final two songs kept the entire audience standing, swaying and grooving to the music. Old Crow Medicine Show’s take on Blonde on Blonde went out with a bang, and the band members were introduced and bowed. The fervent excitement was carried even further, however, by the two-song encore.</p>\n<p>After the group was welcomed back to stage by the well-pleased audience, they encircled a microphone to perform a cover of one of Dylan’s most famous hits, “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door.” This final piece of Dylan’s was carried out slowly and was powerfully accompanied by the unanimous singing of the audience. Finally, the group closed with their hit, “Wagon Wheel,” to which Secor acknowledged Dylan’s collaboration, “with about 40 years between the pen strokes.” The audience was filled with passion, and all moved around with the music. Toward the end of the song, the band stopped singing the chorus so the crowd could take over. Each member sung with fervor, and the group joined back in. The band ended the song amidst dancing, cheering and applause. The evening thus paid a more than fitting tribute to Bob Dylan’s monumental Blonde on Blonde, both through new interpretations of his songs and expressions of his importance for Old Crow Medicine Show.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77771\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/old-crow-medicine-show-plays-classics-for-granada/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77771\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/old-crow-medicine-show-plays-classics-for-granada/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/old-crow-medicine-show-plays-classics-for-granada/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/old-crow-medicine-show-plays-classics-for-granada/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/old-crow-medicine-show-plays-classics-for-granada/","id":6828,"author":{"id":704,"name":"Isaac Mikulski"},"related":[6827,6826,6825],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
