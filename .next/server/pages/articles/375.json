Louisiana-Lafayette outrebounded UCSB 37-22.</p>\n<p>The abundance of turnovers led to no Gaucho player tallying double-figures in scoring. Santa Barbara never led in Tuesday’s game and its slew of seven turnovers in the first quarter spurred the Ragin’ Cajuns’ 12-0 run to take a 17-4 lead. Louisiana- Lafayette’s backcourt was active early as senior point guard Kia Wilridge totaled eight points in the quarter while junior guard Jaylyn Gordon scored six to help the team go up 20-10 heading into the second quarter. Wildridge finished with a game-high 14 points as Gordon was just one point shy of her teammate at 13.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB remained committed to scoring its points in the paint, helping it to achieve such a high field goal percentage. More than half of Santa Barbara’s points occurred from buckets down low as it scored 22 of its points in the paint. Leading UCSB in scoring was freshman guard Coco Miller with eight points on 3-6 shooting from the field, 2-5 from behind the three-point line. She also had a career-high five steals.</p>\n<p>However, the Ragin’ Cajuns held the Gauchos scoreless for nearly four minutes during the second quarter. A make at the free throw line by junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe ended the Gauchos’ scoring drought but Louisiana-Lafayette still went into halftime with an 11-point lead of 30-19.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s cold shooting continued in the second half, not making its first field goal until the 5:11 mark of the third quarter from a Miller jumpshot.</p>\n<p>Helping Louisiana-Lafayette expand its lead in the third quarter was the production of senior guard Keke Veal off the bench. She scored the team’s last six points to end the quarter, ending the game with 12 points on 6-16 shooting, four rebounds, and a team-high four steals to give La.-Lafayette a 42-30 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Veal’s 12 points was the primary source for Louisiana-Lafayette outscoring UCSB 22-10 in bench points.</p>\n<p>Scoring spurts throughout the final quarter helped UCSB to trim the Ragin’ Cajuns’ lead but was not enough as they gained their largest lead of 24 with 2:01 left in regulation. They outscored UCSB 23-12 over the final 12 minutes of the game.</p>\n<p>In spite of allowing UCSB to record a 47.1 field goal percentage, Louisiana-Lafayette concluded Tuesday with a 44.6 field goal percentage on 22 more shot attempts than UCSB from the field to earn the 61-42 win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were outrebounded 29-43 against LSU, but it wasn’t just their lack of boards that resulted in their 68-50 victory over UCSB.</p>\n<p>A career night by senior forward Akilah Bethel guided the Tigers to victory. She scored a career-high 18 points in addition to nine rebounds and tied careers high in assists (5), steals (4) and made field goals (8) to earn Louisiana Sports Writers Association player of the week honors.</p>\n<p>Despite its field goal percentage of 34 percent to end the game, UCSB only trailed by two at 22-24 with 1:53 left in the first half. But, a jumpshot by Bethel sparked LSU’s 6-0 run to close the second quarter to take a 30-22 lead.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB in scoring was senior guard Jasmine Ware as she finished with 10 points but certainly her performance alone was unsuitable to trim the Tigers’ lead to single-digits.</p>\n<p>The third quarter signaled the emergence of sophomore guard Jenna Deemer. She went scoreless in the second quarter after recording six points in the first but was 3-6 from three-point range on an overall 6-11 shooting effort to finish with 16 points, helping give LSU a 48-33 lead going into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 42.9 field goal percentage in the fourth was its best shooting performance of the afternoon. Yet, it was a performance that was overshadowed by the outstanding 66.7 field goal percentage that the Tigers obtained in the quarter to secure the 68-50 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s last away non-conference game is a rematch at Santa Clara this Friday, Dec. 18<sup>th</sup> at 6:00 p.m. in Leavey Center. Santa Barbara will return to the Thunderdome for its final two non-conference games of the season versus La Verne on Sunday, Dec. 20<sup>th</sup> at 2:00 p.m. and Morehead State next Monday, Dec. 28<sup>th</sup> at 7:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66979\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/poor-rebounding-lands-ucsb-with-pair-of-losses-in-trip-to-louisiana/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66979\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/poor-rebounding-lands-ucsb-with-pair-of-losses-in-trip-to-louisiana/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/poor-rebounding-lands-ucsb-with-pair-of-losses-in-trip-to-louisiana/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/poor-rebounding-lands-ucsb-with-pair-of-losses-in-trip-to-louisiana/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/poor-rebounding-lands-ucsb-with-pair-of-losses-in-trip-to-louisiana/","id":375,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[374,373,372],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Drops Fifth-Striaght vs. Broncos, Host LMU on Friday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ChristinaDemarzoWomensBasketball12-1-15_4-web1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ChristinaDemarzoWomensBasketball12-1-15_4-web1.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"It was a poor shooting night for the UCSB women's basketball team, shooting 13-47 from the field in its 48-37 loss versus Santa Clara on Tuesday night.

The shooters have to be ready, and she [Roper] was standing straight up, not ready.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB’s loss in its return home makes the Gauchos 1-7 overall and increased their losing streak to five consecutive games. After beginning its season 0-2, Santa Clara is now 5-2 after earning its fifth-straight victory.</p>\n<p>Despite its shots not falling, Santa Barbara did manage to stay in the game in the first quarter, making 2-5 three-point attempts. Scoring one of the team’s field goals was freshman forward Kali Jones with a layup. Yet she would be sent to the bench due to picking up two early fouls and did not play for the rest of the first half.</p>\n<p>A UCSB turnover in the last 20 seconds of the first quarter resulted in a buzzer layup by sophomore guard Taylor Berry to give the Broncos an 11-9 lead to close the quarter. They capitalized on the quick lead, turning the score into a 6-0 run to open the second quarter.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 5:50 mark that UCSB earned its first field goal of the quarter from a layup by sophomore forward Chaya Durr. Limiting UCSB’s attempt to feed the paint was the Broncos’ 2-3 zone. For the first time this season, the Gauchos were outscored in the paint 14-28.</p>\n<p>Leading the Broncos’ frontcourt was sophomore forward Morgan McGwire as she led Santa Clara with 13 points on 6-10 shooting and grabbed a game-high nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara also used a 2-2-1 full court press throughout the game in combination with its zone. UCSB was unable to overcome the pressures of the defensive traps and double teams of Santa Clara’s on-ball defense, turning the ball over 17 times in the first half and ending with a total of 23 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It [2-2-1 zone] was aggressive, it came to a double right away,” Henrickson said. “We have to have cutters coming to the ball. Everybody has to be more aggressive, not just the ballhander.”</p>\n<p>Santa Clara turned the ball over a total of 29 times, but the Gauchos were unable to benefit from the Broncos’ mistakes, scoring just 13 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>“You have to score,” Henrickson said. “We missed opportunities at the rim. You have to be able to knock down free throws, the free throw line has been an issue for us all year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended its night with a 33.3 free throw percentage, making 5-15 attempts.<br>\nDespite their turnovers, the Broncos managed to increase their lead to a margin of eight at 19-11 with nearly two minutes remaining in the first half. However, a strong first half performance by freshman shooting guard Coco Miller kept the Gauchos’ deficit from getting out of hand.</p>\n<p>After two quarters, Miller was 3-4 shooting the ball in which all of her field goal makes and attempts were from long range. Her two three-pointers as the second quarter ended helped trim the Broncos’ lead to 17-21 at halftime. Adding to Miller’s nine points was a free throw make to give her a game-high 10 points in the first half. She finished the game with a game-high 19 points, finishing 5-10 from three-point distance.</p>\n<p>Before recording her third personal foul with 2:54 on the clock in the third quarter, Jones’ return uplifted UCSB’s presence in the paint. Santa Barbara scored eight of its 11 points down low but could not stop the Broncos’ response as they maintained a 27-23 lead.</p>\n<p>Pulling the Gauchos within a one-point deficit was Miller’s basket beyond the arc, cutting Santa Clara’s lead to 26-27. The Broncos entered the fourth quarter with a 30-28 lead.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara trailed in the beginning of the first quarter, but never lost its advantage once it took a 5-3 lead in Tuesday’s contest. A 13-3 scoring run gave the Broncos their largest lead of 12 at 43-31 with 3:45 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Scoring UCSB’s last six points was Miller with a three-pointer and three makes at the free throw line. Still, her lone performance was not enough to surpass the Broncos’ defense, which held the Gauchos scoreless for the last two minutes of regulation to earn the 48-37 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB was outrebounded 31-45 on Tuesday night, leading to its being outscored in second chance points 7-24.</p>\n<p>UCSB will remain in Santa Barbara for another home game versus Loyola Marymount this Friday, Dec. 4 at 7:00 p.m. The Lions are 2-5 overall and are winless on the road with a 0-3 record in away games.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of December 3, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/womens-bball/","id":372,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[371,370,369],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Second Half Meltdown Leads to UCSB’s 70-63 loss to LMU, Prepare for Three-Game Road Trip","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WBasketball_CamerynBrock_for1162015-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WBasketball_CamerynBrock_for1162015-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite a season-best 81.5 free throw percentage, the UCSB women's basketball team could not maintain its consistency in the second half in its 70-63 loss to Loyola Marymount on Friday.

To her credit she has paid attention while she’s been out. For a kid that can keep somebody behind her, we have to throw her the ball more and get her enough touches.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, it was a season-best performance for the Gauchos at the free throw line as they shot 22-27 from the stripe for an 81.5 percentage.</p>\n<p>After its sixth consecutive loss, Santa Barbara is now 1-8 overall. As for LMU, it was the Lions first win on the road as they improved to 3-5 on the season.</p>\n<p>Both teams had a total of three players score within double-figures, but it was UCSB’s 19 turnovers that aided the Lions’ second half improvements. After just seven turnovers in the first half, UCSB turned the ball over 12 more times while seven occurred in the third quarter alone. The Lions capitalized on the Gauchos’ mistakes, outscoring UCSB 28-10 in points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>LMU’s prowess on defense aided its 50 percent shooting performance in the second half, propelling the Lions in their win over UCSB. Despite being held under a field goal percentage of 30 percent in the first half at 28.1 percent, LMU emerged in the second half. Particularly, the Lions’ 21-10 outscoring of UCSB in the third quarter was their most pivotal stretch in their offensive resurgence.</p>\n<p>A 10-2 run early in the first quarter helped LMU earn a 12-6 lead. UCSB made 14-15 free throws in the first half and made four of its first six points at the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Yet, providing an offensive stimulus for UCSB was senior shooting guard Jasmine Ware. Prior to Tuesday’s game versus Santa Clara, Ware had been in the Gauchos’ starting lineup but came off the bench in their contest against the Broncos. She only played for 10 minutes and had zero points.</p>\n<p>On Friday, Ware played 27 minutes and was the primary catalyst for UCSB’s 27 bench points. She shot 6-13 from the field, 2-3 from long distance for 18 points and led UCSB in rebounds with seven, scoring 15 points in the first half. Her individual 8-0 scoring run in the first quarter gave UCSB a 14-12 lead as it extended its lead to end the quarter up by two, 18-16.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s consistency at the free throw line helped it maintain this lead. Sophomore forward Chaya Durr was efficient, scoring six of her 10 points on the night at the free throw line where she was a perfect 6-6.</p>\n<p>A layup by freshman forward Kali Jones gave UCSB it largest lead of five at 35-30 with 1:06 remaining in the first half. A late layup by LMU’s senior guard Sophie Taylor reduced the Gauchos’ lead to three as they went into halftime with a 35-32 lead.</p>\n<p>Guiding Loyola Marymount’s resurgence in the second half was senior guard Deanna Johnson. She scored 12 of her team-leading 17 points in the half and finished with a 5-8 shooting night and was 6-6 at the free throw line. Johnson’s jump shot was the Lions’ first field goal in the third quarter, sparking their 7-0 run to take a 39-36 lead.</p>\n<p>However, matching Johnson’s performance was sophomore guard Makala Roper. She scored 16 of her 18 points in the second half as back-to-back three-pointers by her and Ware created the Gauchos’ 7-2 run and regained their lead at 44-41.</p>\n<p>In spite of this scoring run, Santa Barbara shot 8-27 in the second half for a 29.6 field goal percentage after a 41.7 percentage in the first half. The Gauchos were held scoreless in the last 2:11 of the third quarter while LMU erupted for a 10-0 run and earned its largest lead of 53-45 to close the quarter.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB managed to trim this deficit behind an 11-point performance by Roper in the fourth quarter. She scored four of the team’s six points to begin the quarter, a 6-0 run that brought UCSB within two 51-53.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed their stoutness on defense, holding LMU scoreless for nearly half the fourth quarter. It wasn’t until the 6:18 mark that the Lions scored their first field goal but it was the beginning of a 6-2 run that gave them a 59-53 lead, causing a UCSB timeout.</p>\n<p>After 19 points on Tuesday, freshman guard Coco Miller couldn’t follow up her play with six points and four turnovers on 2-11, 1-8 shooting from beyond the arc on Friday. However, her one three-point field goal came at the most crucial time as she drained the long-range shot with 1:04 remaining in regulation to bring UCSB within a three-point deficit of 61-64.</p>\n<p>LMU’s 6-2 run in the game’s last minute secured its 70-63 win as the Gauchos looked stagnant on offense and allowed a go-ahead coast to coast layup off an inbound to end the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road for its next three games, spending the majority of its time in Louisiana facing LSU on Sunday, Dec. 13<sup>th</sup> at 1:00 p.m. in the Maravich Center and Louisiana-Lafayette on Tuesday, Dec. 15<sup>th</sup> at 9:00 a.m. in the Earl K. Long Gymnasium. The Gauchos will have a chance to redeem Tuesday’s loss to Santa Clara in a rematch on Friday, Dec. 18<sup>th</sup> at 6:00 p.m. in the Leavey Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66958\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-05/second-half-meltdown-leads-to-ucsbs-70-63-loss-to-lmu-prepare-for-three-game-road-trip/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66958\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-05/second-half-meltdown-leads-to-ucsbs-70-63-loss-to-lmu-prepare-for-three-game-road-trip/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-05/second-half-meltdown-leads-to-ucsbs-70-63-loss-to-lmu-prepare-for-three-game-road-trip/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-05/second-half-meltdown-leads-to-ucsbs-70-63-loss-to-lmu-prepare-for-three-game-road-trip/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-05/second-half-meltdown-leads-to-ucsbs-70-63-loss-to-lmu-prepare-for-three-game-road-trip/","id":373,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[372,371,370],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Chiefs Headed for Underdog Cinderella Run?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/image.jpg?resize=355%2C193&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/image.jpg?resize=600%2C193&ssl=1","description":"The Kansas City have not won a playoff game in 22 seasons.

That is why we root so hard for these incredible stories. And there is no doubt that Eric Berry and the 2015-2016 Kansas City Chiefs are that underdog this year in the NFL.</p>\n<p>On October 12, 2015 Chief fans—and my fantasy football team—were crushed by the devastating news the star running back Jamaal Charles was out for the season with a torn ACL. Six days later Kansas City lost its week six match-up against the Vikings dropping its record to 1-5.</p>\n<p>At the time, their chances of making the playoffs was zero percent. Hope seemed gone, analysts said they were done, fans were hoping for a high draft pick and management was hoping they would get to keep their jobs. That’s when safety Eric Berry stepped up.</p>\n<p>Berry knows all about overcoming adversity. In 2011, after a solid rookie campaign, the former Tennessee safety tore his ACL and was out for the season. He ultimately came back in 2012 and continued his great play and became recognized as one of the best young safeties.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in late 2014 tragedy struck Berry again, but this time much worse, as he was diagnosed with Lymphoma. Once again, he fought back. “Fear nothing, attack everything.” This is what Berry said right after he beat cancer less than a year later. He was playing by the second week of the regular season.</p>\n<p>Just like Berry, The Chiefs chose to fight for what they truly wanted, a playoff spot and a chance to win their first Super Bowl since 1969. By the end of week 16, that dream came true. After defeating the Browns on December 27th, Kansas City secured the fifth seed in the AFC.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs have rallied off 10 straight victories and are a team that everybody would like to avoid. They are giving up 13.2 points per game since week 5 something that has only been accomplished five times the turn of the century, of which two of those teams made it to the conference championship.</p>\n<p>Another reason for the great defensive play is the emergence of rookie Marcus Peters. In 2014, the Chiefs defense combined for six interceptions on the season. In 2015, Peters had eight interceptions by himself.</p>\n<p>It also helps that Quarterback Alex Smith is playing the best football of his career this year. He has already set career highs in yards and advanced metrics like Total QBR. And even without its star RB, Kansas City still ranks 6th in the NFL in rushing behind Charcandrick West.</p>\n<p>Analysts make the case that the reason for the Chiefs rise is the fact that their schedule got easier after week 7. Since then, the combined records of the 10 teams Kansas City has played is 67-91. However, it should be noted that this is the NFL, no game is an “easy” win. The Chiefs had to win 10 straight games, a feat that only on two other NFL teams accomplished therefore implying this isn’t something that happens everyday.</p>\n<p>I’ll repeat that by week six Kansas City had a zero percent chance of making the playoffs and were 300:1 odds in Vegas to make the Super Bowl. Fast forward to today and the Chiefs are in the playoffs with now 14:1 odds to make the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I am wrong for assuming most teams would’ve given up once your record falls to 1-5 in the NFL and that most fans were already ready for the next season. However, when your team leader is a man who overcame a devastating illness that kills millions of people each year, how could you ever possibly justify giving up on him and on the season?</p>\n<p>The Chiefs did something that has only been done once in NFL history and that is make the playoffs after starting the season 1-5 or worse. Eric Berry did something that, unfortunately, many people cannot do, and that is beat cancer. Both underdogs will be looking to end the long 22-year drought without a playoff win that has plagued Kansas City and its fans.</p>\n<p>Something tells me this is the year that its going to happen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
