UCSB students comprised approximately 92 percent of riders on Line 28 in May 2017, according to the UCSB Transportation and Parking Services website.</p>\n<p>UCSB students also make up significant portions of ridership on several other lines, particularly during the academic year.</p>\n<p>Approximately 88 percent of Line 27’s riders in 2017 were UCSB students; about 52 percent of riders on Line 24x and 29 percent of Line 11’s riders were also UCSB students that year.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"width: 830px; min-height: 530px; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.dailynexus.com/interactives/charts/SBMTDRidershipUCSB.html\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe></p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: left;\">Data courtesy of UCSB and SBMTD. <em>Hayley Tice / Daily Nexus</em></h6>\n<p>Line 28 is the only line fully funded by UCSB, according to Blackerby.</p>\n<p>It started service in August 2016 in preparation for the opening of the San Joaquin Apartments in August 2017.</p>\n<p>Line 28 accommodated a large number of passengers before San Joaquin opened, she said.
