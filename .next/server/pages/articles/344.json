Aside from the 29 combined points that sophomore guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Michael Bryson tallied home, Bob Williams accredits this victory to a collective team effort from other players on his squad.</p>\n<p>“It’s crucial when other guys make contributions offensively for us [because] it turns us into a much more efficient team,” Williams said. “John Green was alive … Sam Beeler was really effective [on the floor], and Eric Childress continues to be money shooting the ball from the three-point line. This gives us a lot of balance because opponents are going to pay a lot of attention to Michael and Gabe.”</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos shot a season-high 23-26 from the free-throw line last Thursday.</p>\n<p>Against Riverside, UCSB will have to contain the senior duo of forward Taylor Johns and guard Jaylen Bland. The two are the best frontcourt-backcourt combo in the conference, combining for 32 points per game, Bland at 16.5 and Johns at 15.5.</p>\n<p>Johns carried the Highlanders in their 78-86 loss to Cal Poly last week. The senior scored a game-high 25 points in 38 minutes, also tallying his fifth double-double of the season with 10 boards.</p>\n<p>While Bland only scored five points in his last match, he and Johns have scored 20-plus or more points in seven games this season.</p>\n<p>Looking to avenge their six-point loss last Thursday and upset UCSB at home, junior guard and Darius Graham and senior forward Josh Fox will play pivotal roles Saturday night against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Graham is coming off a big game against the Gauchos scoring a game-high 19 points while going 3-4 from downtown. The 5-10” floor general has shown signs of being an offensive threat, leading Davis in scoring five times this season including a 21-point outing in its 58-55 win against Riverside.</p>\n<p>Big man Josh Fox will try and compliment Graham’s guard play down low in the post. Last year’s Big West Sixth Man of the Year, the forward has been having an unforgettable senior campaign leading all Aggies in scoring with 14.2 per game and field goal percentage with 51.5 percent. Fox has led his team in scoring 10 times this season while scoring 17 or more points in ten occasions.</p>\n<p>With regard to last Thursday at UC Davis, a conference win was not the only achievement Coach Williams accomplished against his former team. Coaching the Aggies from 1990-1998, the three-time Big West Coach of the Year collected his 299th win last Thursday.</p>\n<p>While this milestone is a notable one, just one victory shy of being the 3rd coach ever in conference to eclipse the 300-win mark, Williams says at this point it is just a number.</p>\n<p>“The win at Davis meant a lot to me because it was home for eight years … but I’m just not attached to the number of accumulated wins at this stage in my life,” Williams stated. “Maybe 10 years from now when I’m reading through a scrapbook that will be something that means something to me.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face UCR tonight at 8 p.m. UCSB returns to action in the Thunderdome this Saturday, Feb. 20 versus UC Davis, which is set for a 7 p.m. tip-off time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 18, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68353\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68353\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/","id":344,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[343,342,341],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Sisterly Ties: From the Court to the Heart","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-6-of-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketballCamerynBrock-6-of-13-web.jpg?resize=801%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Put into perspective is the influence of family, specifically her older sister Afure, in the life of third-year point guard Onome Jemerigbe of the UCSB women's basketball team.

But it’s great having multiple siblings. I’ve always loved the fact that there’s always multiple people to talk to; it’s like having three best friends.”</p>\n<p>Of those three best friends, the relationship with her only sister, Afure, developed into a relatability beyond the ties of lineage, for it also revolved on the basketball court.</p>\n<p>“She’s [Afure] definitely one of the biggest influences I have as a person and for the reasons why I play basketball,” Onome explained. “She started off playing basketball when she was young. Me being the youngest, I always kind of copied my older siblings, so I kind of followed her into it. Her love for the game influenced me to even try out for basketball.”</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, Afure’s love for the game of basketball didn’t develop without the persistence of a valiant effort that was committed to improving everyday. Nonetheless, Onome served as a constant reminder in ensuring Afure displayed her best at all times.</p>\n<p>“I have always had an incredible love for the game. It was that love that made playing basketball so much fun for me,” Afure said. “I truly believe that Onome plays the way that she does, with so much heart and passion because she too has this love for the sport.”</p>\n<p>Afure attended and played basketball for St. Mary’s High School from 2006-2010. She ranked No. 15 on ESPN HoopGurlz 100 list during her senior year and was a 2010 McDonald’s All-American.</p>\n<p>When Afure was a senior at St. Mary’s, Onome was a freshman. While it was one of the few opportunities for the two to play together, Afure made sure to cherish her last year both being around and playing with her sister.</p>\n<p>“When baby sis played with me for a year during her freshman year in high school, my senior year, I loved it,” she said. “I could watch over her. Make sure she was doing her homework especially on the road games. She was the point guard and could see things from a perspective that I couldn’t, and as a wing guard and an experienced athlete, I could see things that she couldn’t. We have always had such a fun, goofy and close sister to sister relationship. I consider her to be my best friend. I want her to always be the best person that she can be, and I knew that it in order for her to be that, that it started with me. It started with me because I am her older sister and she looked up to me. We were always around each other.”</p>\n<p>Yet their time together would end with Afure attending and playing basketball at the University of California, Berkeley. After graduating in 2014, she played one season overseas in Spain for Al-Qazeres women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>It is through these experiences in which Afure has been able to help guide Onome throughout her career. Specifically, helping enhance Onome’s capabilities both on and off the court is most paramount.</p>\n<p>“From playing at Cal and then going to play overseas, I learned the importance of good character. Character is what is deep inside us; it’s who we are on a daily basis, when things go well and when things go wrong,” Afure said. “It’s who we are in the locker room, on the court as well as in the classroom. We have reason to be proud when both reputation and character are a mirror image of each other.”</p>\n<p>As Onome was in her first year at UCSB, Afure was a senior preparing to conclude her collegiate career at Cal. Although the two sisters were members of opposing programs, Afure helped integrate Onome into the duties and responsibilities of being a collegiate student-athlete.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the stuff she [Afure] went through has helped me to become a better player,” Onome said. “I’m not the perfect player, but I’ve definitely grown because of her. She explained what she should have done, all the mistakes she made. It helps me to not make the same mistakes.”</p>\n<p>Currently in her third year at UCSB as the floor general for the Gauchos’ women’s basketball team, Onome has had an immediate impact on the court since her arrival. Thus far, she has started in 79 of 86 career games played, having started all 29 games her sophomore season.</p>\n<p>Her performance through the years has resulted in her being named to the 2013-14 All-Big West Freshman Team, and she was an Honorable Mention All-Big West recipient last season.</p>\n<p>So far this year, Onome has excelled since the start of the Big West Conference schedule, leading the conference in assists per game with a 5.4 average while ranking second in steals per game with 2.1.</p>\n<p>She also set career-highs in scoring with 20 points at UC Davis and 11 assists versus Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>While her individual accolades do not surpass the team’s long-term goals and the role she plays in them, Onome accredits her maturation as a person to her production on the court.</p>\n<p>“Freshman year, I was easily bothered,” she said. “Not to say that I don’t get bothered every once in a while, but I’ve definitely grown in the mental part of basketball. Just being able to control my emotions and make sure I give my all every time despite if I have turnovers or if we weren’t being successful as a team.”</p>\n<p>While Onome continues to impress on the court and owes much appreciation to Afure for inspiring her love of the game in addition to providing advice on life as a collegiate student-athlete, true inspiration for both sisters begins with their mother. An immigrant from Nigeria who persevered and raised four children, Onome acknowledges her mother as the constant reminder to continue to work hard each day.</p>\n<p>“My mother keeps me balanced, keeps my head straight,” Onome said. “She always seems to know what to say to get me back on track.”</p>\n<p>It has been the existence of this family foundation that has contributed to the person Onome is both on and off the court. According to her, the core to this foundation originates with one word: loyalty.</p>\n<p>“They’re the people that are going to be there for you when times are hard and when times are good,” Onome said. “You can always rely on them to support you and be there for you.”</p>\n<p>Afure has epitomized this essence of loyalty all along, and is now just attempting to replicate the same support system that was provided to her.</p>\n<p>“Home is where heart is. Family is the epicenter of all reasons. Family to me is root of my very existence,” she said. “Without family we wouldn’t be the people that we are today.”</p>\n<p>While basketball helped to further establish the relationship between sisters Onome and Afure, it never defined their bond.</p>\n<p>Once the shot clock hits zero and it’s time to hand in your jersey, the temporary reality of basketball is realized, but family is forever.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 25, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68566\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68566\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/sisterly-ties-from-the-court-to-the-heart/","id":341,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[340,339,338],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take On USC in 2015 Home Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB got its offense going last week, but can the Gauchos keep it up hosting a Trojan team off to a hot 5-2 start?","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Playing in just its second home game of the season, the UCSB men’s basketball team welcomes the USC Trojans to the Thunderdome tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66880\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1912400557\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66849\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66880\" data-attachment-id=\"66880\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/maxwell-kupchak-reaches-for-a-rebound-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MBball_vsOhio-20151121-DustinHarris-13-web1.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Maxwell Kupchak reaches for a rebound.

The Trojans have since dropped their last two games on the road to No. 12 Xavier and Monmouth and come to Santa Barbara at 5-2.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Inconsistent shooting had been the story for the Gauchos to start the season, but they appeared to find some answers on the offensive end in their last two outings, particularly from their starting guards in junior Eric Childress and sophomore Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>Against Arizona St. on Sunday, Childress put up an all-around stat line characteristic of his ability to do all the little things, recording nine points, seven rebounds, six assists and two steals. Vincent, who had been particularly struggling with his shot through the first three games of the year, went 12-25 from the field and 6-13 from deep over the past two games. He is averaging 10.8 points and 1.4 steals per game, good for third and second best on the team, respectively.</p>\n<p>Two players who have most certainly not hurt UCSB’s shooting percentage are seniors Michael Bryson and Sam Beeler. Since missing the first game of the season due to suspension, Bryson has stepped easily into his role as the team’s best offensive player, shooting a team-best 37.5 percent from three and 48.2 percent from the field. His 18.8 points per game average ranks second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Beeler, who has started all five games at center, has shot an extremely efficient 76 percent from the field, finding most of his shots deep in the paint for an average of 7.6 points a night.</p>\n<p>The Trojans’ 5-0 start to this season was their best start since going 8-0 in 2000-01. They are led on the offensive side by former Etiwanda High School standout guard Jordan McLaughlin. The sophomore, who was voted one of the team’s two captains for the 2015-16 season, was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman team last season with averages of 12.1 points, three rebounds and 4.5 assists. He has been especially hot to open this season, leading the team with 15.3 points per contest and shooting 55.2 percent overall and 51.9 percent on threes.</p>\n<p>Backing him up are junior guard Julian Jacobs and freshman forward Bennie Boatwright, who come in averaging 12.4 points each. In just his freshman year, Boatwright has impressed with an ability to score from inside and out, tying McLaughlin for the team lead in three-pointers made with two per game.</p>\n<p>Jacobs has shown that he can do much more than just score, sitting at second on the team with averages of 6.3 rebounds and 1.28 steals and leading the way with 5.5 assists.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game will be the Gauchos’ last home game of 2015 before playing their next six on the road. Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of December 3, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66849\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66849\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/gauchos-take-on-usc-in-2015-home-finale/","id":342,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[341,340,339],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"As Big West Tourney Nears, UCSB Looking for Wins Against CSUN and LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WBball_vsHawaii-20160206-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Beginning the UCSB women's basketball team's three-game home stretch is its matchups versus Cal State Northridge tonight and Long Beach on Saturday.

After splitting their pair of games last week with an 80-62 win over UCI and a 60-52 loss to Long Beach State, the Gauchos prepare for rematches versus Cal State Northridge tonight and LBSU on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Chasing UCSB are the Matadors in sixth-place at 6-18, 4-6 in the Big West. They were defeated by UCSB 65-49 in the first meeting between the two teams two weeks ago. The 49ers managed to redeem their first road loss of the conference season at Hawaii, which ended their five-game winning streak, with their victory over UCSB last weekend. LBSU ranks fourth in the Big West with an 18-6 overall and 7-3 conference record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a 2-12 start in its non-conference schedule, it seemed like the reigning conference tournament champions were destined for a first-round exit in the postseason. Although the Matadors remain below the .500 mark in Big West play, they could be the ‘cinderella’ story of this year’s tournament in March.</p>\n<p>Central to CSUN’s improvements in the second half of the season has been the emergence of freshman center Channon Fluker. After starting in just one game during the non-conference portion of the season averaging 6.6 points per game and 6.5 rebounds per game, Fluker has been one of the most dominant post players since the start of the Big West schedule.</p>\n<p>Recently, Fluker has recorded seven consecutive double-doubles and is averaging 20.8 points and 13.9 rebounds per game. Through 10 Big West games, she has led CSUN with 16.7 ppg and 12.4 rebounds per game. Both conference averages lead the Big West thus far.</p>\n<p>She didn’t start in the Matadors’ first meeting against the Gauchos, and finished with eight points on 3-8 shooting and a game-high 15 rebounds in 26 minutes of play. While the addition of Fluker to the team’s starting lineup may make a difference, the Matadors hope to avoid another inefficient shooting night. Overall, CSUN shot 19-53 (35.8 percent) and 3-13 (23.1 percent) from beyond the arc in the Feb. 3 meeting.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, it was a phenomenal shooting night for the Gauchos, posting their third best three-point shooting performance of the season at 42.9 percent. Nonetheless, Santa Barbara notched a 45.8 field goal percentage to complement its long-range shooting.</p>\n<p>Contributing to the Gauchos’ fluent shooting from behind the perimeter and from other areas of the court was senior guard Jasmine Ware. Although she attempted just one shot from deep, she registered a game-high 17 points on an 8-11 shooting effort.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will attempt to recover its tremendous three-point shooting after an 18.2 field goal percentage from beyond the arc last Saturday at LBSU. However, ensuring that it contains Fluker will be the Gauchos’ main priority entering tonight.</p>\n<p>Continuing UCSB’s home stand is its rematch versus Long Beach State Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will seek to rally back from its worst shooting night from the field (28.8 percent) and from behind the three-point line (18.2 percent) in a conference game this season in its loss to the 49ers. Once again, UCSB will have to endure Long Beach State’s stout defense which leads the Big West and ranks 13<sup>th</sup> in the nation with 21.3 turnovers forced per game.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB forced 21 turnovers last Saturday, it allowed Long Beach State to capitalize on points off turnovers at a greater pace of 25-17 in which the Gauchos turned the ball over 18 times. After netting a career-high 20 points, four assists and four steals in the team’s win over UCI, junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe was responsible for six of UCSB’s 18 turnovers against LBSU.</p>\n<p>Benefitting from the 49ers’ advantage in points off turnovers were junior forward Madison Montgomery and junior guard Raven Benton. Both finished with 15 points and were precise with their shot selection. Montgomery shot 7-11 from the field, while Benton went 5-6 to go along with three steals.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to possibly defeat LBSU, not only will it need to reduce its amount of turnovers, but it will need more production from its bench. The Gauchos were outscored 24-13 in bench points while Roper was the only player on the team to notch double-figures in scoring with 16 points on a rough 4-14 shooting afternoon. Despite 21 minutes from Ware and 26 minutes from senior guard Dioseline Lopez, the two combined for 11 points on 4-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>Even though UCSB managed to tie the game at a score of 48-48 in the fourth quarter, it lacked a consistent source of offense to secure a victory.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game versus CSUN will begin at 7 p.m. The Gauchos will welcome Long Beach State to the Thunderdome on Saturday, Feb. 20 and face the 49ers at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/as-big-west-tourney-nears-ucsb-looking-for-wins-against-csun-and-lbsu/","id":343,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[342,341,340],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
