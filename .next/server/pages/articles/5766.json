May will also mark the 10th anniversary of the first of these films, “Iron Man.” Over the past 10 years, the MCU has not had a truly terrible movie, though some of them have been fairly lackluster. In celebration of the fantastic “Black Panther” and in anticipation of “Infinity War,” here are the 18 films of the MCU, ranked:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>18. “Thor: The Dark World”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The Dark World” isn’t bad, but it is overwhelmingly mediocre. Natalie Portman is normally a phenomenal actress, but she is clearly disinterested in the film and in her ostensible love interest. Tom Hiddleston as Loki gives the movie some charm and some drama, and Anthony Hopkins provides gravitas as Odin, but the movie miraculously gets mired in boring Earth drama that distracts from even more tedious sci-fi fantasy. Chris Hemsworth’s physique is certainly mighty, but the second “Thor” is not.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>17. “The Incredible Hulk”</p>\n<p>Edward Norton plays Dr. Banner/Mister Hulk in a movie that technically belongs to the franchise. Norton isn’t bad here, but Marvel was able to replace him with Mark Ruffalo in “The Avengers” with barely anyone noticing. “The Incredible Hulk” offers a dull, rote love interest and a CGI climax that looked ugly 10 years ago and has since aged like Ultron. It has some charm, but not enough to be worth remembering or re-watching.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>16. “Iron Man 2”</p>\n<p>The second “Iron Man” is a little bit of a mess, and its many subplots don’t always work well with each other and don’t always pan out. And after the dynamite first “Iron Man,” it was a little bit of a letdown. However, Robert Downey Jr. is still fantastic as the sardonic Tony Stark, and the Iron Man suit is still the coolest thing a 10-year-old will ever see. Don Cheadle steps into the role of Rhodes effortlessly, and Gwyneth Paltrow remains the most dynamic female lead in any of these films. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson are all fantastic actors and are fantastic in their individual parts, but they are too much in a film that is less than the sum of its parts. The movie is overstuffed, and the pieces of the whole don’t work, but it’s a whole lot of fun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>15. “Ant-Man”</p>\n<p>“Ant-Man” took a long time to finally make it to the screen, and along the way it lost its original director and creative engine, Edgar Wright. The film still bears marks of his visual comedy and wit, but it will always be marred by the thought of what might have been. Despite the behind-the-scenes troubles, Paul Rudd is hilarious as Scott Lang, Michael Douglas is a perfect jerk as Hank Pym and Evangeline Lilly kicks butt as Hope van Dyne, the soon-to-be Wasp. The villain is underwhelming, and the movie is very non-essential, but it’s light, breezy and very funny. It would have been stronger if Evangeline Lilly had gotten to be super from the start, but that’s the biggest problem in an otherwise very agreeable film. It doesn’t aim for much, but it hits its mark right on target.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>14. “Thor”</p>\n<p>“Thor” is a weird movie. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, known for his Shakespearean filmography, half of the movie embraces its epic, bizarre setting. The other half plays as a fish-out-of-water story set in New Mexico. The plot is very basic, but the movie paces well, short and sweet. As far as the cast, Portman isn’t so boring in this one, and Hiddleston provides the franchise with its most persistent and charismatic villain. Hemsworth is very muscular in this one, too, and he gets to show a little of his comedic side, a hint of what’s to come nearly a decade later in “Thor: Ragnarok.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>13. “Doctor Strange”</p>\n<p>“Doctor Strange” goes through many of the same beats as the original “Iron Man,” but if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a great Dr. Steven Strange (which is the character’s actual name), and the movie has a trippy visual palette that is a lot of fun. The action is a deviation from the typical superhero movie fare, with teleporting, alternate dimensions and a snarky cape. Tilda Swinton is good, Mads Mikkelsen is wasted, and Cumberbatch antagonizes himself by also playing Dormammu through motion capture. The finale works as a counterpoint to the rest of the paint-by-numbers plot of the movie, with a funny, inventive and clever climax. What’s more, the movie works as the most expensive PSA against texting and driving of all time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>12. “Iron Man 3”</p>\n<p>The reveal of Ben Kingsley’s Mandarin as a bumbling actor takes a lot of the gas out of “Iron Man 3.” Rebecca Ferguson’s character was destined to be the villain, not the murdered love interest, and the reworking of the film to focus on Guy Pearce’s Aldrich Killian as the antagonist really hurts it. Other than that clumsiness, though, the movie really shines. Shane Black directs, and the movie feels remarkably like a Black film, with his tonal and directorial sensibilities totally intact. In fact, his flair for dark comedy dovetails phenomenally with Downey Jr.’s snark. The movie offers a satisfying end to the “Iron Man” trilogy while providing room for the character to grow in later installments of the overarching MCU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>11. “Avengers: Age of Ultron”</p>\n<p>“Age of Ultron” goes a little awry with attempts to set up later films in the MCU running into the pacing of the main story, and while James Spader’s Ultron plays well as a snarky Frankenstein’s monster of Stark’s creation, the movie is caught in the trap of trying to balance too many plates. A 10-minute deviation to set up “Thor: Ragnarok,” (which is hilariously out of sync with the movie that actually got made), an out-of-nowhere romance between Black Widow and the Hulk and the hasty introduction and death of Quicksilver leave the movie feeling disjointed. However, the action is incredible, and the introduction to Paul Bettany’s Vision, a godlike android who is both mythic and alien, is one of the high points in the entire franchise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>10. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”</p>\n<p>The second “Guardians of the Galaxy” cranks up the humor, and, for the most part, it works. A few of the jokes undercut more serious moments, and the relationship between Chris Pratt’s Peter Quill and Michael Rooker’s Yondu could’ve been more developed, but the movie works. The soundtrack rivals the first film’s, Kurt Russell’s Ego is a far better villain, and the glorious color palette of the film pops with vibrant colors and a well-defined sci-fi aesthetic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>9. “Thor: Ragnarok”</p>\n<p>“Thor: Ragnarok” turns the “Thor” franchise into an outright parody of the superhero genre, albeit a loving parody. Exchanges are improvised, and the jokes never stop coming. Like all the best parodies, “Thor: Ragnarok” also works well as the genre it’s parodying. The action is gorgeous, and the score is absolutely bonkers with dramatic choirs, triumphant symphonies and blazing synths. The film is the embodiment of the bizarre, tacky sci-fi fantasies of the ’80s, and because of its brazen confidence and unwavering willingness to just be silly, the movie about Thor and the Hulk having space adventures just works.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8. “Guardians of the Galaxy”</p>\n<p>“Guardians of the Galaxy” offers a cosmic version of the Avengers, with many of the same draws. The dynamic of a team coming together is magical in a similar way, but what makes “Guardians of the Galaxy” so amazing is how it manages to introduce five protagonists and bring them together all in one film. Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket the Raccoon and Groot all enter the film as unknown entities and make their mark in a big way. The villain is a little weak, but other than that, the movie is an absolute jam.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>7. “Spider-Man: Homecoming”</p>\n<p>As the sixth “Spider-Man” movie and the third iteration of the character on the silver screen, “Spider-Man” Homecoming” has to work to justify its existence. Fortunately, the movie is a joy. Tom Holland is pitch perfect as a Peter Parker struggling to become an Avenger while trying to get a date for homecoming. Michael Keaton as the Vulture is one of the MCU’s greatest villains, giving the movie a killer twist, and Iron Man is able to exist in the film as a mentor without stealing the spotlight. The cast is peppered with great comic actors, from Martin Starr to Hannibal Buress to Donald Glover, who fill the film with humor while grounding it in Parker’s very teenage world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6. “The Avengers”</p>\n<p>Watching “The Avengers” when it came out was an event. A sequel to five different movies at once with characters from each different franchise was something never before seen. The action was huge, and the immense battle scenes were offset by persistent charm and quips. Ruffalo enters as the Hulk without a hitch, working better in a team-up movie than the Hulk ever could by himself. Different aspects of the previous films come into play in a way that doesn’t punish viewers for having missed some of the previous movies, while also making the universe feel very full and fleshed out. “The Avengers” is a ton of fun with Earth’s mightiest heroes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>5. “Captain America: Civil War”</p>\n<p>The third Captain America worked as an Avengers movie, but its Captain America branding gave it the narrative focus necessary to create some real drama and tight plotting. Chris Evans is steady and dependable as Captain America, while Downey Jr. stands out in his best performance of Iron Man yet. This is the movie that fits most effortlessly into the context of the Marvel universe, introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man into the story all while servicing the fundamental conflict of the film. Daniel Brühl plays Zemo as a relatable villain, though he is overshadowed by the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man. The airport fight sequence where Avengers fight Avengers is the best in the series, and “Captain America: Civil War” is the best Avengers movie so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. “Iron Man”</p>\n<p>The first of the franchise, “Iron Man” came out nearly a decade ago and is still one of the high points of these movies. Downey Jr. was born to play Tony Stark, with his playboy attitude underlined by moments of real humility. The movie uses an awareness of the real world and its politics and consequences to ground the fantastic narrative in reality. The end credits scene, the first of many to come, hinted at a broader universe in the making. “Iron Man” is funny, dramatic and creates the foundation for a universe immersive enough to handle 18-plus films.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. “Captain America: The First Avenger”</p>\n<p>“Captain America” is a World War II war movie that features not just a superhero but a very good man. Director Joe Johnston uses the movie’s period setting to create a story of black and white morality, with larger than life heroes fighting larger than life villains. The anachronistic HYDRA, with its space age weapons derived from a magic cube, is the perfect villain for this blast-from-the-past pulp adventure. The film’s over-the-top conflict of good vs. evil allows for Steve Rogers, played by Evans, to exist as a paradigm of selflessness and self-sacrifice, which is a refreshing fantasy in the more conflicted modern age.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2. “Black Panther”</p>\n<p>T’Challa was first introduced in “Civil War,” but in “Black Panther,” he has a movie dedicated to himself and his world, and the movie is better for it. The first act is a little long and the last act is a little short, but Wakanda and its cast are so fully realized that they more than makes up for the film’s pacing problems. Michael B. Jordan’s Erik Killmonger is a villain who steals the scene every time he enters, and he is a critical part of the film’s political ideology. “Black Panther” is continually embarrassed by a wealth of riches, with its stacked cast, kinetic action and a vital story packed with meaning and thematic resonance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li>“Captain America: The Winter Soldier”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“Captain America: The Winter Soldier” takes Steve Rogers from his simplistic, 1940s comfort zone of right and wrong and throws him headfirst into the 21st century. Robert Redford plays the film’s main villain, and his presence works perfectly with the film’s ’70s spy thriller tone. From bottom to top, the film’s construction is airtight. Humor is present in the film without undercutting the tension, and the action is as grounded as a superhero movie gets. While the film doesn’t wear its heart on its sleeve as boldly as “Black Panther,” it is still an intelligent movie with a point of view. “The Winter Soldier” also worked as a major paradigm shift in the MCU, altering its trajectory for the better. With almost no fluff to speak of, “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” is almost a perfect piece of escapist entertainment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 11 of the Mar. 1, 2018 issue of </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81664\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/marvel-films-from-worst-to-best/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81664\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/marvel-films-from-worst-to-best/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/marvel-films-from-worst-to-best/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/marvel-films-from-worst-to-best/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/marvel-films-from-worst-to-best/","id":5766,"author":{"id":770,"name":"Christien Skousen"},"related":[5765,5764,5763],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":770,"name":"Christien Skousen","biography":"Not available","articles":[5766,5806],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Why I (actually) Feel the Bern","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Chalk-Bernie4President_Courtesy-of-BernieSandersVideo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Chalk-Bernie4President_Courtesy-of-BernieSandersVideo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Felicia Balli talks about why she truly feel the Bern. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I am not voting for Bernie Sanders because I am a “Millennial.” I am not voting for Bernie Sanders because I am a “young woman in my 20s following a popular trend.” Put simply, I am voting for Bernie Sanders because I am educated. Now, I am not quite caught up on nuclear physics, and I would probably struggle a bit on any given biology exam (props to you, science majors … y’all the real MVPs), but I am also not the type to undervalue my political science degree and minor in women, development and culture as an “easy ride through the social sciences on my path to an MRS degree” (I can ramble on about that bullsh** stereotype for days, but I’m excited you’re still even reading this, so I will abstain from my desire to digress). </p>\n<blockquote><p>We tend to think of extreme poverty in other parts of the world as something we take no part in, something we rationalize as the consequences of the evil behavior of evil people who lack our moral compass.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Admittedly, I haven’t always been interested in politics. In fact, I got into UCSB as an econ major and was weeded out by the econ majors that were indeed supposed to be there (as well as the ones that wisely chose not to thoroughly damage their livers the first quarter of freshman year). It wasn’t until my third year that a sociology course — later to become the foundation for my minor — allowed me to look at the bigger picture. I studied women, poverty and exploitation in the third world and was forced to take a hard look at the institutions that perpetuate injustices in these areas. We tend to think of extreme poverty in other parts of the world as something we take no part in, something we rationalize as the consequences of the evil behavior of evil people who lack our moral compass. As it turns out, however, the sources of this evil lie far closer to our realm of familiarity and influence than we realize, protected by a powerful system that we have underestimated and hidden behind a sensationalist media that has underestimated us. I was able to gain a global perspective that considered the genuine suffering of human lives — lives we often denigrate to nothing more than a statistic — and recognized the role politics had played in causing this suffering. The same politics that we get bored of and ignored. The politics that have — due to our lack of attention — fallen into the wrong hands and subsequently the wrong pockets. The United States has historically been the most powerful country in the world, so when we allow multi-billion dollar corporations to buy politicians and thus the votes that deregulate their activity, the repercussions of that are felt all over the world. </p>\n<blockquote><p> Even if you find yourself in disagreement with his ideas on domestic social/economic policies, Bernie is the ONLY candidate who wants your vote to count to the full extent of your rights as an American citizen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bernie Sanders is not making history because he is a viral trend amongst young idealists; his popularity has spiked because he has given people faith that we can create a politics that cares about people. He has created a movement that has brought people together from both the left and the right who can all agree that our political system is rigged. Even if you find yourself in disagreement with his ideas on domestic social/economic policies, Bernie is the ONLY candidate who wants your vote to count to the full extent of your rights as an American citizen. He has shown through record-breaking turnouts and individual contributions that the American people can regain control of our political process. We can no longer accept the narrative that politics are only for politicians. We can no longer fulfill the stereotype that young, educated Americans are more passionate about who wins “The Bachelor” than which American corporations profit from labor exploitation and human rights abuses around the world.  It is not just our duty to our country, but our responsibility to the global community to be politically active citizens who acknowledge that we indeed have the power to change the world.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68548\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68548\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/why-i-actually-feel-the-bern/","id":5763,"author":{"id":397,"name":"Felicia Balli"},"related":[5762,5761,5760],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bernie’s Leftism is Not Americanism: A Response to UCSB For Bernie","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bernie_Sanders.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bernie_Sanders.jpg?resize=682%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A letter to the editor from Howard Sachs responding to UCSB for Bernie's most recent article.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you for sharing your thoughts on Bernie Sanders with people on and off campus. I respect them. I comment not with any sense that I will change your mind. I comment just to encourage you to do what you are at college to do: open your minds. Hear and think about the best of ideas. On this subject of politics, do listen to the leftism of the Democrats but also listen, read and understand what you are rejecting when you reject the other side. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In our schools today and in our media what you basically get is an avalanche and embrace of leftism. You just don’t hear the traditional values of America- the values that founded this country and made it great.

I have nothing to do with P.U. but it is one of the best sites to present the other side- the side essentially banned from our universities, the side you are rejecting These are the values that gave Bernie everything, that makes his life dignified. These are the values he and you, right now, reject. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was young once too. Most young people are attracted to leftism. I campaigned and voted for George McGovern. Passionate and idealistic, many young people are arrtacted to leftism. They are attracted because leftism is very alluring. It is utopianism- almost a heavenly kind of thing. “All will be pretty much free. We will just take from the greedy rich and distribute it to others and then everyone will have great healthcare, and free college, and a nice warm place to live, a good safe car, no polluting fossil fuels, and plenty of healthy food, good clothing and shelter.”  I know the idea too, “corporations are what are pulling us all down. If only we crush those 20 million dollar a year CEO’s, all will be well again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I tell you, college is just the first tiny step into the world of knowledge, wisdom, experience and idealism. Most people when they leave college and get married, take care of a spouse and kid, start working, start experiencing and understanding the world around them change markedly.  I think they become better people. I think they grow up and become actually more idealistic and more compassionate but with mature ideals and compassion.  They come to understand true morality, maturity and love with American values- not leftist ones.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American values tell us lots and lots of liberty is at the core of our lives. Leftism is about taking and more taking of liberty. That money you have worked hard for is yours, not Bernie’s to give to others who deserve it more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Americanism is about us living in a sea of liberty populated with small islands of government power. Leftism is the opposite. Bernie and his like are about seas of coercion and power populated with small islands of freedom and liberty. Bernie and his massive government’s, after reaching into your pockets and taking most of your property will then will tell you and I what schools to go to, what kind of healthcare to receive, what cars to drive, how to educate our kids, what type of energy to use, how to save for retirement, how much income is enough and what kind of light bulbs we can screw into our desk lamps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But leftism and Bernie are alluring to us all. The child never leaves the core part of our souls. We all yearn to be taken care of from the day we are born to the day we die. But Americanism, American values help us grow up. They help us leave Eden and face the real beautiful and yes challenging adult world out there. Bernie has never really left that world of childhood. He is a kind, decent, well meaning man but stuck in childish fantasies. Good luck to you. I hope you leave college continuing to learn and experience. I wish you well. I hope you someday embrace Americanism as strong, tough, self-reliant and very free people.  I hope you reject someday the mean, coercive, freedom and maturity -crushing ideology of leftism. Life is complex and a challenge for all of us, those on the left and those of us who embrace American values.  Onward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69187\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69187\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-30/bernies-leftism-is-not-americanism-a-response-to-ucsb-for-bernie/","id":5764,"author":{"id":400,"name":"Howard Sachs"},"related":[5763,5762,5761],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lean and Green: No Beef with Meatless Mondays","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Now that meat-substitutes are more available and popular than ever, swapping animal flesh with healthy vegetarian options doesn't have to be a sacrifice.

It’s not surprising that, with all the stress that comes with it, many new students gain the dreaded “freshman fifteen.” A study published in <em>Nutrition Journal</em> found that nearly a quarter of freshmen gain at least five percent of their body weight during their first semester, an average of about ten whopping pounds in just a few months!</p>\n<p>In an effort to help students look and feel great, the movement toward offering more plant-based meals is taking root on college campuses nationwide. In fact, there are more than 200 universities leading the charge with Meatless Monday programs in their dining halls.</p>\n<p>Why take a weekly holiday from meat? In recent decades, our meat consumption has increased dramatically — and along with it, our waistlines, blood pressure and cholesterol. Meat is high in saturated fat which is associated with obesity and preventable chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, some cancers and stroke.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A study by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health found that there is a strong association between meat consumption and obesity. A review published in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> concluded, “[A] plant-based diet seems to be a sensible approach for the prevention of obesity[…].”</p>\n<p>Even if we can’t switch to a completely plant-based diet, we can make incremental changes. Kaiser Permanente is one of the nation’s largest healthcare and insurance providers. It recently published a “Plant-Based Diet” guide that states: “Any movement toward more plants and fewer animal products can improve your health.”</p>\n<p>Eating more healthy, plant-based meals not only helps our physical health, but can also lighten our carbon footprint.</p>\n<p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, animal agriculture is “one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.” Factory farms — where nearly all of our meat comes from — are major culprits in climate change. These animal factories create huge amounts of manure that pollute the soil, water and air.</p>\n<p>And of course reducing the amount of meat we eat is good for animals, too.  The fewer animals we raise for food means less pressure on animal agriculture to raise them in cruel and intensive ways. For example, large demand for meat has led to the practice of genetically manipulating chickens to grow so obese so quickly that many can’t even walk more than a few steps before collapsing. To help animals, the Humane Society of the United States advocates the Three Rs: “reducing” or “replacing” consumption of animal products, and “refining” our diets by switching to products from sources that adhere to higher animal welfare standards.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, it’s never been easier to take a positive step toward safeguarding our health while also protecting the planet and helping animals. Choosing simple, delicious options once a week can make a big difference. How about swapping those chicken nuggets with meat-free nuggets? Or choosing veggie and bean burritos instead of carnitas burritos? Eating out is easy, too. With options like Chipotle and Denny’s serving up hearty meat-free fare and with Indian, Thai and Mexican restaurants that regularly offer delicious plant-based dishes, the options are endless.</p>\n<p><em>Bon appétit!</em></p>\n<p>Eddie Garza is a food policy coordinator for The Humane Society of the United States.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56195\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/lean-and-green-no-beef-with-meatless-mondays/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56195\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/lean-and-green-no-beef-with-meatless-mondays/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/lean-and-green-no-beef-with-meatless-mondays/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/lean-and-green-no-beef-with-meatless-mondays/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/lean-and-green-no-beef-with-meatless-mondays/","id":5765,"author":{"id":628,"name":"Eddie Garza"},"related":[5764,5763,5762],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
