Two players nearly single-handedly took down UCSB with 6’5’’ senior center Molly Schlemer scoring a career-high 37 points and junior guard Ariana Elegado totaling 30 points.</p>\n<p>“You have to have a short term period, especially in conference because you have a game on Thursday and then a game on Saturday,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “I know I was thinking about it the entire weekend, so we have to let it go. Right now, we’re focused on Long Beach. They’re just as good.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers have compiled a 9-7 overall and 1-1 conference mark thus far, defeating UC Irvine before losing to UC Davis. In both games, Long Beach came from behind in the second half.</p>\n<p>After giving up 88 points against Cal Poly, the focus this week for UCSB is 100 percent on defense.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t worked on one thing offensively this week,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Early in the year, as a head coach, I made that adjustment [to run] because we had no bigs, but now as we go into conference play and into postseason, there’s no way we’re going to win unless we play defense.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Long Beach features balanced scoring and is a team currently playing through its guards. Freshman guard Raven Benton leads the 49ers at 14.4 points per game while two-time All-Big West honorable selection member Alex Sanchez averages 11.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“They have [Benton], who is pretty fast. She can knock down the jumper and get to the rim,” freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe said. “Then they also have two other bigger guards that can play a post. We just have to play some good ‘D.’”</p>\n<p>However, the 49ers’ recipe for success this season has been on the defensive end. They lead the Big West in steals with 11.2 per game, 13.5 during conference play and rank second in blocks with 4.1 per game.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, the Gauchos top the Big West in turnovers, giving the ball away just 13.7 times per contest.</p>\n<p>“The things that they do that’s messed with a lot of people is that they switch defenses every trip down the floor,” Mitchell said. “So whether they’re going 2-2-1, 1-3-1, or 3-2, they’re switching it up and it’s causing people to turn the ball over. Hopefully by us playing two point guards and four guards most of the time, it will alleviate some of the turnovers.”</p>\n<p>This matchup with Long Beach should suit Santa Barbara well as UCSB also plays through its guards. Senior guard Nicole Nesbit ranks third in the league in points per game with 17.6. Mason and senior guard Melissa Zornig, both of whom stepped up in San Luis Obispo, also average double-digits with 14.0 and 13.3 points per game, respectively. Mason scored a career-high 24 points Saturday and both Zornig and Mason shot 4-5 from three point range.</p>\n<p>As a result, UCSB is the only team in the Big West to feature three players in the top 14 in scoring.</p>\n<p>“It’s funny because we don’t even talk about it. We know our roles and what we need to contribute to the game,” Mason said. “We’re seniors putting the team on our backs because we have a lot of newcomers. We know the system, so we’re getting shots we know we shoot well at and knocking them down.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears on page 7 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53575\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/gauchos-continue-big-west-play-at-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53575\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/gauchos-continue-big-west-play-at-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/gauchos-continue-big-west-play-at-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/gauchos-continue-big-west-play-at-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/gauchos-continue-big-west-play-at-long-beach-state/","id":575,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[574,573,572],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Begins Big West Play at Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nic.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nic.jpg?resize=540%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos try to break a five-game skid against Cal Poly","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Head Coach Carlene Mitchell has accomplished a lot in her two and a half years at the helm of the UCSB women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>She’s won a Big West Tournament Title and been to the NCAA Tournament.

We’re going to have to do a lot of things well to beat them on their home court,” Mitchell said. “The competitive side of me wants to win, but I want to win more for the seniors and I want to win more for this program and having the chance to win championships, and right now, that’s going through Poly.”</p>\n<p>In fact, only three players on the UCSB roster know the feeling of defeating the team’s biggest rival. Dating back to March 5, 2011, the seniors, guards Destini Mason, Nicole Nesbit and Melissa Zornig, helped earn a 78-67 on the road over Cal Poly to become co-Big West Champions.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now get another shot at Cal Poly Saturday when Mitchell and her squad open Big West play in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“We’ve haven’t beaten them since our freshman year, and not even on our home floor,” Zornig said. “It’s pretty frustrating, especially since some of the games have been close. I think for us seniors, it’d be huge to come out and beat them.”</p>\n<p>Both teams enter Saturday’s installment of the Blue-Green rivalry with recent struggles. At 5-8 overall, Santa Barbara has lost five of its last six games. Similarly, Cal Poly has dropped three of its last four, but Wednesday night improved to 7-7 overall and 1-0 in the Big West with a 78-74 overtime victory in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Playing a long game Wednesday in Hawaii and then returning home for a game Saturday presents a taxing travel schedule for the Mustangs. Last season, teams who played Hawaii at the beginning of the week went 0-4 in their following game that weekend.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, on top of the Blue-Green rivalry and defending a five-game winning streak over UCSB, Cal Poly will have the motivation of defending its home court, where the team is 5-0 so far this season.</p>\n<p>“You know you’re going to expect energy with the tradition these two programs have had and the rivalry,” Mitchell said. “I don’t have to say anything and I’m sure [Cal Poly Head Coach Faith Nimnaugh] doesn’t have to say anything for the players to show up and understand how important this game is.”</p>\n<p>The biggest problem in previous years for the Gauchos was the Mustang’s potent offense, which will once again serve as a challenge as Cal Poly tops the Big West in scoring with 74.9 points per game. Last year’s Big West Tournament Champions also rank second in the conference in field goal percentage and three point percentage, shooting 40.9 and 32.2 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Option number one on the offensive end for Cal Poly is the reigning Big West Player of the Year, 6’5’’ senior center Molly Schlemer. Schlemer ranks third in the Big West in points per game (17.8), first in rebounding (10.8) and second in field goal percentage (54.7 percent).</p>\n<p>Taking the assignment on Schlemer will be 6’4’’ junior center Clair Watkins, who averages a team-high 7.0 rebounds and 2.3 steals in her three games with UCSB after transferring from Vanderbilt.</p>\n<p>“All five times (we’ve lost) the problem has been on the defensive side of it. We have to try to figure out a way to guard Molly,” Mitchell said. “Even though (last year’s senior center Kirsten) Tilleman was blue-collar and had the toughness, she was legit 6’1’’,” Mitchell said. “This year, we’ve worked on a lot more zone, so I think we can mix it up a lot more where it’s not just one on one post defense.”</p>\n<p>However, Schlemer is one of just several options for the Mustangs offensively. The team also features two All-Big West honorable mention selections from last season in a pair of point guards. Junior Ariana Elegado is currently averaging 15.5 points and a team-high 4.6 assists per game, good enough to tie her for first in the Big West. Senior Jonae Ervin adds 10.8 points and 4.5 assists per game. Wednesday night against Hawaii, Ervin exploded for a career-high 37 points and team-high 10 rebounds to help her team come back from 17 down to win.</p>\n<p>“As seniors we know what to expect and I’m telling [our teammates], ‘be ready for these guards’ because they’re no joke,” Mason said. “They’re very talented and smart and know how to play together.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, if UCSB wants a chance for a victory, it will have to play incredible defense. While not as dominant as in previous years, the Gauchos still rank third in the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 69.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will then have to finish the job defensively by rebounding. Cal Poly leads the conference in rebounding at 43.9 per game while UCSB ranks last in the category with just 32.5 boards per game. In addition, in victories, the Gauchos average 37.8 rebounds compared to 29.2 in losses.</p>\n<p>“Whether you’re full fronting and you need to roll to get in rebounding position or you got caught behind, you have to put a body on [Molly],” Mitchell said. “She’s big and you have to make the refs call it. You’re not going to get any calls unless you block out and make contact.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB is a much improved team this year, putting up an average of 67.1 points on the scoreboard each outing, almost 15 more points per game than in Mitchell’s previous two seasons. The Gauchos also lead the Big West in field goal percentage, shooting 42.0 percent.</p>\n<p>However, while the Gauchos have succeeded with the fast break, Saturday will be all about defense.</p>\n<p>“We definitely don’t want a track meet. We’re not going to outscore anyone and I’ll continue to say that we have the ability to score high 60’s and 70’s any given night,” Mitchell said. “Defense will be the emphasis. I probably won’t even write any offenses on the board because I think if we can do the things we need to on the defensive end of things, we’ll have a chance to win.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday is set for 4 p.m. at Robert A. Mott Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>“They have a great one-two punch just about every night,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Schlemer remains the inside force and gives them a double-double every night. And then Elegado and [senior guard Jonae] Ervin just rotate on who’s going to carry the burden on the offensive end of it. [Ervin] had 37 in Hawaii and Elegado had 30 tonight. That’s tough when you’re trying to play zone and it’s hard to match-up one-on-one with Schlemer on the inside.”</p>\n<p>Schlemer led the way for Cal Poly, scoring a career-high 37 points on 16-20 shooting from the field. With 15 rebounds, Schlemer completed her eighth double-double of the season. Fronting, playing behind or trying to stop her in a zone, UCSB had no answer for the 6’5’’ reigning Big West Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Once she’s on the block, she just turns and she finishes,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “She’s very big. We have to make sure we have help-side and be aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Elegado finished the evening with 30 points, six rebounds and five assists, hitting big threes when the Gauchos went into a zone defensively to try to slow down Schlemer. Her 30 points is nearly double her season average of 15.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Overall, while Santa Barbara is known for its defense, it simply was no match for the Mustang’s offense. Overall, Cal Poly outshot UCSB 50.0 percent to 34.3 percent and outscored the Gauchos 46-16 in the paint.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, the loss marks the sixth straight defeat to the Mustangs, which improve to 8-7 overall and a perfect 2-0 in the Big West. The Gauchos, on the other hand, drop to 5-9 overall and 0-1 in conference play.</p>\n<p>“You want to win no matter who you play. I don’t care if it’s Cal Poly or the no-name school from whatever,” Mitchell said. “Our kids are going to compete and it’s game number one of the Big West. That’s what we know.”</p>\n<p>Knocking down threes in the first half, UCSB was able to keep the score close. UCSB was 6-9 from behind the arc in the opening period with Mason and senior guard Melissa Zornig both shooting 3-3 from downtown. Mason’s third three of the half brought the score within two at 36-34 with 2:31 to go, but Cal Poly finished the half on a 5-0 run, including a leaning three while on the run from Elegado at the buzzer.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos went ice cold to begin the second half, going 2-14 from the field. With Cal Poly’s offense showing no signs of slowing down, Santa Barbara lost all control of the game and remains winless against the Mustangs during the Carlene Mitchell era.</p>\n<p>“It was within striking distance,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes when kids try too hard, you shoot it short. We missed a lot of easy chippies right in the lane. It wasn’t just three pointers that we were taking. You have to compete and put the ball in the basket when you get open looks and that’s your responsibility.”</p>\n<p>One bright spot for UCSB was the play of Mason, who tallied a new career-high for the fourth time this season with 24 points on 10-17 shooting, including 4-5 from three-point range and a team-high six rebounds. Zornig also contributed 18 points.</p>\n<p>“I was just playing free,” Mason said. “If I had a shot, I [took] it and made sure I stayed on the attack. A few threes went down for me, so that was good, but I was just playing how I usually play.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will regroup and return to action on the road Thursday against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 13th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53494\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53494\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/gauchos-drop-sixth-straight-to-mustangs/","id":573,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[572,571,570],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Rival Poly in League Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bballvscalpoly_annakodelashvili_1.11.14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bballvscalpoly_annakodelashvili_1.11.14.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos lose 72-64 in Big West opener to Cal Poly","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a season-high 5,982 fans in attendance for the Blue-Green rivalry game, the Thunderdome was rocking Saturday in anticipation of the start of Big West play for the UCSB men’s basketball team.

We’ve just got to be better ­— it’s a long conference season and we’ve got 15 more games to fix this.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara opened the rivalry game flat, trailing 28-24 at the half, and did not respond much better in the second half, falling behind by 12 in the early minutes after the break. The Gauchos rallied to as close as three but could never get over the hump, often failing to hit clutch shots and opting for three-pointers instead of the steady inside presence of Williams.</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a guy that they can’t handle, you keep going to him,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We didn’t have the discipline tonight where we’ve had that discipline in many games. We didn’t make Cal Poly make a decision.”</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 2-17 from the three-point line, whereas Cal Poly finished 11-18 from behind the arc, proving to be the major difference in the game.</p>\n<p>The only story for UCSB in this game was Big Al’s 33-point, 15-rebound performance. Williams scored 22 for UCSB in the second half and was one of only two Gauchos to score in double figures, the other being junior point guard Zalmico Harmon with 10 points.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly played very well, and we didn’t respond,” Coach Williams said. “I thought Al showed up, but I don’t think anybody else showed up and responded.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs received much of their scoring from unlikely sources in this game. Junior forward Anthony Silvestri finished with a team-high 17 points, going 5-7 from behind the arc despite his season average of under four points scored per game. Another bench player in freshman guard Taylor Sutlive added 11 points on 3-4 shooting from the three. Together, the duo provided dagger after dagger towards Santa Barbara’s hopes of climbing back in the game.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t contest, we didn’t listen and we didn’t switch or pay attention to the good shooters,” Harmon said. “No offense to them, they’re a great team, but we let two guys who’d come off the bench come in and light us up off of miscommunication and not knowing personnel.”</p>\n<p>Opening conference play with a loss, especially at the hands of a rival, was a major disappointment for the Gauchos considering how well they played in the non-conference portion of the schedule.</p>\n<p>“It happens, we hate that it happens, it shouldn’t happen, but tonight it happened. It’s time for some reflection,” Big Al said. “We’ve got to look ourselves in the mirror and see what we did wrong and fix all the things that we need to fix. It’s a long season, we’ve just got to get back in practice and do better and get our focus back.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 13th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna Kodelashvili of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/ucsb-falls-to-rival-poly-in-league-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/ucsb-falls-to-rival-poly-in-league-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/ucsb-falls-to-rival-poly-in-league-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/ucsb-falls-to-rival-poly-in-league-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/ucsb-falls-to-rival-poly-in-league-opener/","id":574,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[573,572,571],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
