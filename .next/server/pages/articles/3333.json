As time went on, OrgSync was no longer properly serving the evolving needs of students from feedback the OSL had received, Ashlock said. Student organizations had trouble navigating the website and were not able to create their own sites, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, OSL began to look at different software options and found a program called CampusGroups, also known as Shoreline, Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is a student-engagement platform that doesn’t just serve the OSL, but it also serves departments in Student Affairs and across the campus and therefore is an engagement platform for every student,” Ashlock added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning from OrgSync to Shoreline had its fair share of problems, such as delays in shifting the information of organizations to the new platform, Ashlock said. The data renewal process took place last spring through a Google Form where current organizations could sign up and update their contact information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unfortunately, we lost information for about 10 organizations,” Ashlock said. “We had reached out to them on multiple occasions to invite them to complete full registration in Shoreline and up to nearly 400 organizations have. We did mention that we did contact those organizations and say, ‘You have this much time to save your website data from OrgSync, but you will lose it otherwise.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said another issue limited the number of graduate students listed, but the problem has since been fixed and graduate students are now included in the database. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the faculty and staff are being loaded onto the platform this week as well, Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSL is also working toward using Shoreline to create a more functional check-in system for when a group hosts an event. Ashlock estimates that this new feature will be ready at the end of the quarter when OSL is finished with data integration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new check-in system will offer five different ways to sign into an event, depending on the event organizer, who can enable whichever option they choose, according to Ashlock. Students will be able to check in with a QR code provided through the Shoreline app or they can scan a QR code posted at the event; alternatively, they can scan, swipe or tap their Access Card for entry, Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a lot of versatility and all of those options can exist side by side,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone with an Access Card is going to be able to check-in and keep a log of events that they’ve attended.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shoreline website is currently available online for students, and an app is in development, which will provide access to student groups and student resources, such as </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho On-Line Data (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G.O.L.D.), GauchoSpace and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billing Accounts Receivable Collections (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BARC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s basically an instant messaging platform that merges student engagement and student resources,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we developed this app, we’re looking to create, even if it’s not just a single app, a more seamless environment where students can really go and get all the information they need in an efficient way.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article <span class=\"__in\">appeared</span> on page 5 of the Nov. 21, 2019 <span class=\"__in\">print</span> <span class=\"__in\">edition</span> of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Besides having also won five pennants, this team took it all the way to the top in 2015 only to lose the World Series to the reigning American League champions, the Kansas City Royals. It seems evident that this New York team is fired up and ready to claim the title as their own this year.</p>\n<p>According to<a href=\"http://mlb.com\"> <em>mlb.com</em></a><em>, </em>Madison Bumgarner is likely to pitch for the Giants against the Mets’ Noah Syndergaard. Affectionately known as “Madbum” and “Thor,” these two power players have both played solid seasons with their teams going 15-9 and 14-9 while on the mound, respectively.</p>\n<p>Bumgarner, a 27-year-old from North Carolina, made his MLB debut in 2009 and has impressed the baseball world ever since. Although he was part of three World Series champion teams and has won numerous individual accolades, 2014 remains his best year to date.</p>\n<p>He was the winner of the Babe Ruth Award, named NLCS MVP, as well as World Series MVP in addition to his exceptional performance in postseason. Out of high school, he was selected tenth overall by the San Francisco Giants and has only continued to improve his abilities as a player and a teammate.</p>\n<p>Syndergaard, only having made his debut in May of 2015, has been a firecracker on the field and an enormous asset to his team. Drafted 38th overall by the Toronto Blue Jays, this Texan quickly worked his way to the top leaving a notable trail behind him.</p>\n<p>In 2013, he started for Team USA in the Futures Game and by the end of the year was ranked the 11th-best prospect in baseball by<a href=\"http://mlb.com\"> <em>mlb.com</em></a><em>.</em> He performed with outstanding ability in the 2015 World Series as a rookie and became the second- youngest Met to win a World Series game. Although he is newer to the big leagues, Syndergaard has certainly proven his worth, not to mention his knack for strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The winner of this game will advance to the divisional round of the National League playoffs on Friday where they will meet the top seeded Chicago Cubs. During the 2016 season, both Wild Card candidates have been evenly matched with the National League Central team.</p>\n<p>In May, the Giants defeated the Cubs two games to one, yet in September San Francisco lost at home in a four-game series, losing the set 3-1.</p>\n<p>Alternately, in early July the Mets swept the Cubs when playing on their own turf, but lost the three game set at Wrigley Field, 2-1.</p>\n<p>This year’s potential World Series candidates are at their strongest and working their hardest. While a majority of the 2016 Major League Baseball Season has been exciting, nothing compares to the intensity of postseason play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/","id":3330,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[3329,3328,3327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Trump from the Office of the President of the United States,” was authored by Off-Campus Senator Tyler Ferguson and seconded by On-Campus Senator Adalis Rojas. It calls on the 70th Associated Students (A.S.) Senate to support the “impeachment and removal” of President Trump from office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, Senate meets weekly in the Flying A Studios Room of the University Center, but the decision was made Tuesday afternoon by Internal Vice President Alli Adam to move this week’s meeting to Corwin Pavilion as a matter of safety and space, to ensure that the Flying A Studios Room was not overcrowded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the meeting, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez said while there is “no way of knowing” the size of the crowd for Wednesday’s meeting, the Senate generally moves to a larger space when it is “a kind of topic that very likely people will want to comment on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Senate leaders expected a larger crowd due to the nature of the resolution’s topic, approximately 20 people were present for Wednesday’s meeting — a number which decreased to approximately five by the end of action items for the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have heard from many students that this resolution is important to them and that they support it,” Ferguson said in an email. “They have said that President Trump’s actions affect all of us, and they have emphasized the importance of holding our President accountable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a Senator, I have the duty of representing my constituents with diligence and intention. I feel that it is my duty to express my support for the impeachment of President Trump, as his actions affect my constituents lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also discusses the whistleblower within the Trump Administration who </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/26/us/politics/whistle-blower-complaint.html?module=inline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">came forward</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in August with concerns about a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower accused Trump of pressuring Zelensky to gather damaging information on 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution calls Trump’s alleged actions “illegal” and writes that it is “Congress’s duty to impeach a President who commits high crimes and misdemeanors while in office.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It sets a bad precedent to allow a sitting President to commit crimes while in office and get away with it when the President of the United States is expected to abide by all of the laws of the United States of America,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson emphasized in his email that he believes the Senate has a “moral responsibility” to pass the resolution and set a precedent for action on future national political decisions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With a school as politically engaged as UCSB, I think there is an importance of taking stances on major political issues like this,” Ferguson said. “I do believe the majority of the student body would support passing this resolution.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the passage of the resolution, Ferguson believes Senate will continue passing more resolutions around national political issues in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do think we will feel more comfortable in the future as a Senate with taking stances on major political issues.

Alia Reynolds, president and UCSB coordinator of Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), led conversation with administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel discussed plans to further educate students on sexual assault prevention, including expanding mandatory sexual violence and harassment training to all clubs and sports teams and putting trainings online through GauchoSpace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One key distinction between SASA and UCSB’s position about what action to take in light of recent allegations is the university’s mutual no-contact orders, which state that neither respondent or survivor can be near one another in shared public spaces. SASA, per Reynolds, claimed during the town hall that this prohibits survivors from accessing areas integral to their education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA supports California Senate Bill 493, which, as Reynolds explained in the meeting, aims to ensure that sexual assault survivors have equal access to education through the abolition of mutual no-contact orders and resources for survivors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC currently does not support the abolition of mutual no-contact orders, SASA explained during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the panel discussion, Tallin Moyer, a member of SASA and Pi Beta Phi sorority, read a statement on sexual violence in Greek life and requested updates on other concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Greek life can provide a facility for leadership and self-growth — however, it is unacceptable that we as a Greek community have not realized the true magnititude of how our system enables sexual violence,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Members of Greek life need to realize how fraternities foster rape culture and put individual safety at risk. It is unacceptable to think these events have occurred in a vacuum.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public comment, one Greek life-affiliated student voiced her concerns about Sigma Pi’s participation in Arrowjam, an annual dance competition hosted by sorority Pi Beta Phi in order to raise money for Read &gt; Lead &gt; Achieve — a charity dedicated to children’s literacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moyer, whose sorority hosted the philanthropy, told the student that she understood the concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree with you, that was not taken into consideration at all, and I hear you, that it could be triggering to see them up there … It was the opinion of some of the women in our sorority that not all the men in Sigma Pi should be punished for the actions of a few. But I totally understand the concern, and [we] will be talking to our president about it,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sigma Pi went on to compete and win the fraternity portion of the competition, which occurred on Nov. 8, eight days before the SASA Town Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA also promoted its Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Map at the town hall. The map, facilitated by SASA, includes the UCSB campus and surrounding Isla Vista community. Anyone can anonymously report instances of sexual violence or harassment, which are pinned onto the digital map. Yellow pins stand for one report at a location and red stands for multiple. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s mostly faith-based, although I am cautious about calling it that, but we are in the sense of believing survivors. But we see everything that goes through, and we monitor it closely,” Moyer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds then inquired to administrators about the Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) training email, which was sent to the entire student body on Nov. 1, soon after a timely warning email was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sent out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about a reported sexual assault at Sigma Pi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We personally were concerned about the timeliness of the email about R.A.D., because obviously it was sent out during a very triggering, emotional time for many students,” she said. “The email only served to increase these feelings. We were also concerned that the email mentioned only women, which seemed to exclude men and gender non-conforming folks.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Ollman, representative for SBSO, explained that while the timing of the email was unfortunate, it had already been scheduled and pre-selected. R.A.D. training is heavily overviewed by the national organization and leaves little room for individual departments to change gender pronouns or create more inclusive wording, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explanation regarding email alerts for the student body was another topic of discussion throughout the town hall. UCSB has two forms of communication for alerts: emergency notifications and timely warnings, which fall under Clery Act jurisdiction. The Clery Act mandates public safety reports on specific crime categories, including sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency notifications are “designed to give information about ongoing threats,” UCPD’s Community Service Officer Ariel Bournes explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Timely Warning Notices fall under a different, highly specific category of warning, and failing to issue one that meets the criteria means a potential fine of up to $57,300, according to Associate Dean of Student Life Miles Ashlock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we become aware of something that violates the Clery Act, we are mandated to report it, simply because a report has been filed and not because it has been investigated. The university is mandated to send Clery warnings only about Clery crimes that occur on university property… it’s a really bizarre, unique set of circumstances,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also inquired about the safety prevention tips issued in one such timely warning, including covering one’s drink or never taking drinks from strangers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel like the burden is being placed on the survivor once again, especially when the tips are things like, ‘Cover your drink, don’t take drinks from strangers,’ she explained to Ashlock. “We know these things. These things aren’t new to us. You are expecting people to control their own safety, in a sense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlcok responded by stating that “one of the challenges of violence prevention education is coming at it from all these different angles.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to have a clear message against violence in the community. There is not one proven method of violence prevention. There are a lot of different things, and not all of them feel good even to us, but we want to provide a variety of tools so in aggregate we reduce the rates of violence in our community,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, many students still had concerns about the existence of sexual violence within UCSB’s Greek life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t just put a Band-Aid over this,” Moyer said in response to one student concerned about a lack of accountability within fraternities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To truly eradicate this culture and make a change, we can’t just remove one specific fraternity, but instead perform surgery on our culture as a Greek community.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.
