Marks added a lottery ticket at the shooting guard position in Caris LeVert, who showed the ability to score in bunches in his four years at Michigan.</p>\n<p>Though the lower body injuries that cut short his final two seasons are a concern, LeVert shot over 40 percent from three on over four attempts per game from his sophomore season onward.</p>\n<p>That shooting ability was paralleled by improvements in each of his four years in assists per game and assist percentage (an estimate of the number of teammate field goals assisted by a player while on the floor), the latter reaching 33 percent in his final season.</p>\n<p>With Rondae Hollis-Jefferson establishing himself as a defensive menace and an athletic marvel in his rookie campaign, the Nets are in need of someone at either the shooting guard or small forward to make up for his poor offensive game outside the paint.</p>\n<p>Enter LeVert, who should be able to grow with Hollis-Jefferson, cover up his shooting woes and allow the Arizona product to work off-ball cuts to his preferred areas more often as a result of potentially advanced playmaking at both guard positions.</p>\n<p>With the Boston Celtics receiving their first round pick in each of the next two seasons, adding LeVert gave the team another possible young building block.</p>\n<p>Speaking of guards, Sean Marks was able to acquire Jeremy Lin on a steal of a contract at three years, $36 million.</p>\n<p>Possibly eager to reunite with new the Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, a developmental wizard who was an assistant with the Knicks during Lin’s initial breakout, Lin took what seemed below his market value at an average of $12 million per season. Maybe the Nets were the only ones offering a starting job, but getting Lin for the next three years will give the Nets a competent starting point guard who could easily shift to a backup role if need be.</p>\n<p>Lin has shown the ability, both in Los Angeles and in Charlotte last year, to run an excellent pick-and-roll, with the speed to get downhill into the paint quickly and a strong shooting stroke both off the dribble and catch. He isn’t starting for a championship contender, but he fills the biggest hole on the Nets’ roster and gives them a reliable go-to play with a Brook-Lin pick-and-roll that will be difficult to stop in the regular season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71975\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71975\" data-attachment-id=\"71975\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/img25367215/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img25367215\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71975\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img25367215.jpg?resize=311%2C194\" alt=\"Jeremy Lin averaged 11.7 ppg coming off the bench in Charlotte last season.

Tyler Johnson and Allen Crabbe both received huge paydays with four-year contracts for $50 and $75 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Though both offers were matched by Miami and Portland respectively, the two bloated contracts will limit the future possibilities for both franchises. In Miami, Johnson’s contract will count for just under $6 million against the cap during his first two seasons, before tripling in cost for the final two.</p>\n<p>Though Miami hopes it can hit big on free agency during those first two years, paying Johnson, Whiteside and Goran Dragic close to $70 million in 2019-20 will constrict those desires.</p>\n<p>Crabbe will earn around $18 million per season, slightly more than the recently signed Evan Turner. Crabb is probably best served as a backup shooting guard, playing alongside either Lillard or McCollum while the other rests, though this is a ton of money for that service.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the Blazers have over $45 million invested in two players who harbor sufficient liabilities (defense for Crabbe, lack of outside shooting for Turner) to make both best suited for reserve roles.</p>\n<p>The Blazers hold few options moving forward, and with an extension for CJ McCollum uprising, they will likely be stuck with some iteration of this roster for the foreseeable future. Thanks to Marks’ aggressive moves, the Nets hamstrung two of the more dangerous teams in the league; Portland fresh off an impressive showing against the Warriors, and the Heat who are always a threat for a league-altering splash.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>The Celtics Get Their Man</em></strong></p>\n<p>Boston was finally able to lure a free agent to what has been a malaise of mediocre young talent and promises of a not-so-distant contender. Constantly propped up by the coaching of Brad Stevens, this odd collection of players was able to cobble together 48 wins in 2015-16, but clearly needed more offensive firepower apart from Isaiah Thomas in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Al Horford should perfectly complement this team, and vice versa; Jae Crowder will be an upgrade defensively from anyone who played small forward recently for the Hawks, likewise for Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart as point-of-attack stoppers who far exceed Dennis Schröder and Jeff Teague in that capacity.’</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71976\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71976\" data-attachment-id=\"71976\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-25/rebuilt-teams-look-to-contend-for-eastern-crown/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"630,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71976\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hi-res-56cbba3c585350a0ce346c41159548d4_crop_north.jpg?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Al Horford started all 82 games last season for the Hawks averaging 15.2 points per game and 7.3 rebounds per game.

Kelly Olynyk and Jonas Jerebko are also far superior three-point shooters to Millsap, offering Horford more space to operate during their shared time on the court.</p>\n<p>In the draft, the team reached for Jaylen Brown, impressed with his athleticism, ability to drive to the rim and seemingly high character. Though Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn and even Jamal Murray offered a higher floor than Brown, who held some of the worst statistical translations for such a high pick in recent history (Kevin Pelton), none shared Brown’s hydra-like ceiling on the wing, able to tenaciously defend four positions and get to the rack at will.</p>\n<p>The Cal product certainly struggles to fulfill that potential, however, as defensively his body is far more NBA-ready than his mind, and on the offensive end, his impressive drives end with missed lay-ups more often than made ones, and his passing ability is inconsistent. The flashes of a great player are there, and the Celtics are certainly a team with the flexibility to bring him along slowly, but it’s not difficult to see his career being a substantial disappointment.</p>\n<p>Ainge spent his next-to-first rounders on Guerschon Yabusele, a 20-year-old power forward from France who looked like an absolute tank in summer league and may come over this season, and Ante Zizic, a 19-year-old Croation center with vociferous energy who will stay abroad for at least one more year. Yabusele offers physicality and playmaking in a 270-pound package, and though he’ll require a ton of coaching on defense, it’s easy to picture him making a contribution in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The young supporting cast is perfect for Horford, as his post-30 career will be aided by a roster that mostly shares a positive age curve. Boston is still in need of another star, and for either Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown or one of the other draftees to show some serious juice.</p>\n<p>In an offseason where Celtics established themselves in the wrung below the Cavaliers out East, however, the move is a welcomed development for a franchise that was treading water, and can now consider itself a conference finals contender.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We all know the greatness of Duncan. We know about the five rings, three Finals MVPs, 15 all-star appearances, two league MVP awards and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of such a decorated and honored career most people, including myself, can also come to the conclusion that Duncan is the greatest power forward to ever live.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He was the star of a team that, for 19 years, displayed constant greatness year in and year out. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spurs never missed a playoff series during his 19-year career and have maintained a winning percentage never less than .610. Duncan is also only one of two players in NBA history to win an NBA title in three different decades (the ’90s, ’00s, ’10s).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes Duncan a true superstar is the fact that he never acted like or was treated like one. He never caused controversy — except for when it came to his disdain over his favorite referee, Joey Crawford — and never wanted to be in the spotlight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duncan wasn’t “sexy” like these other superstars. I mean, seriously, what’s sexy about the nickname “The Big Fundamental.” It’s no “King James” and it certainly is no “Black Mamba,” but it’s representative of him, and that’s what makes it special.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was only one thing he cared about: winning. And in this day and age in which loyalty has become overrated and players are constantly seeking a bigger market to expand their brand, it’s refreshing to know that there was a player who truly looked beyond superficiality and simply wanted to play the sport he loves with his beloved teammates, coaches, and city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Kobe Bryant had to make his exit from the NBA known to the world by jacking up 50 shots and scoring 60 points — that’s why we love you, Kobe — it was fitting that Duncan’s way of leaving was to make a quiet exit toward stage right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Clipper fan, I know Duncan will always have a special place in my heart, seeing as how he constantly used to rip it out in the pre-Chris Paul days. From 2003-2010, the Spurs and The Big Fundamental beat the Clippers in 26 of 27 match-</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ups including an 18-game winning streak from 2006-2010.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard being a Clipper fan — trust me, I can attest — but it’s only made harder when there’s one team and one guy in particular who continually beat your team quite handily.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71892\" style=\"width: 287px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71892\" data-attachment-id=\"71892\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-12/farewell-to-a-big-fundamental/29906170001_3624585928001_screen-shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=539%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"539,374\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?fit=539%2C374&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71892\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?resize=277%2C192\" alt=\"Duncan retires having won five rings, tied for 14th most in NBA history. / Photo Courtesy of Associated Press\" width=\"277\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?w=539&amp;ssl=1 539w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29906170001_3624585928001_Screen-Shot-2014-06-16-at-4-44-20-AM.jpg?resize=250%2C173&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-71892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Duncan retires having won five rings, tied for 14th most in NBA history. / Photo Courtesy of <em>Associated Press</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is why when the Clippers beat the Spurs in that playoff series in 2015 and Chris Paul made that game-winning shot in game seven over Duncan, my life as an NBA fan was, in a way, complete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know it’s not the same as winning a championship — and believe me, the next round is still painful to talk about to this day — but finally seeing the team I love to get over the hump against the team I despised most was truly satisfying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My hate for Duncan was simply out of respect for the man and his craft. I hated that he wasn’t a Clipper, winning all those games and championships for us, but I loved the man he was on the court and respected the man off of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching Duncan lose that series against the Clippers was like seeing my favorite cartoon hero defeat his enemy for the first time. And yet, watching Duncan retire is like watching the final episode of that cartoon; it really feels like my childhood is over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess that’s why No. 21’s decision to retire really gets me at an emotional level. But as the other constantly heard cliché goes, all good things must come to an end. Just like every great player that has walked away from the game during my lifetime, I’ll get over it. But I’ll never forget the greatness that is known as Tim Duncan aka the Big Fundamental.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks for the memories, Tim, and I can’t wait to watch that Hall of Fame induction speech in 2021.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Really, I am.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those people had to suffer through 52 years of brutal heartache and 147 seasons played in professional baseball, basketball, football and even hockey since winning their last title. Hell, the last time they won a trophy was when the Browns took the victory in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, two years before it became known as the Super Bowl. It was about time they have something to celebrate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And celebrate they have, after the Cavs, led by superstar LeBron James, won their first NBA title in NBA history. Riots in the streets; fights breaking out; people jumping up and down on cars, hanging on streetlights and lampposts, breaking bar windows, climbing responding fire engines and ambulances, stealing road signs and traffic cones, etc. etc. A lifetime of anguish for many Clevelanders was let loose in one night in a fit of terror on their own city. But, hey, they needed this.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a San Diego sports fan, I can relate.

Neither has won their current league’s title, with the Padres only appearing in the World Series twice, while the Chargers have appeared in only one Super Bowl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Padres made it to the World Series in 1984 and 1998 and got destroyed both times. In their first appearance against Detroit, the Padres stood no chance, losing the series 4-1. Their second time around they did even worse as they were swept by the Yankees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chargers one appearance in the Super Bowl since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger was an absolute blowout as Steve Young, who threw for 325 and a still-NFL-record six touchdown passes, and the 49ers cruised to an easy 49-26 victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three of these championship appearances are from either before I was born or at least before I can remember. But the strongest memories I do have about the two teams I’ve loved my whole life involve similar heartache in which I witness them get close to a chance at a title and then watch that opportunity wash away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most striking and lasting impression I have of my Chargers is from the 2006 season, when the team finished with the best record in the NFL at 14-2. They were the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and primed for Super Bowl contention led by stars such as Philip Rivers and Ladainian Tomlinson and looks forward to home field advantage secured throughout the playoffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite all the hype and excitement, they then collapsed in their first game of the postseason. A startling 24-21 loss to the New England Patriots in which they committed four turnovers, three of which led to Patriots scoring drives. Despite outgaining their opponent in rushing yards and total yards as well as intercepting opposing quarterback Tom Brady three times, the Chargers’ season was cut short in catastrophic fashion.</span></p>\n<p>Not to be outdone by their football counterpart, the Padres had a heartbreaking season of their own in 2010, a year in which they were predicted to finish last in the NL West but shocked the sports world by holding strong atop the division for most of the season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71846\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71846\" data-attachment-id=\"71846\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-08/the-hard-life-of-a-san-diego-sports-fan/san-diego-padres-ballpark/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=645%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"645,340\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"san diego padres ballpark\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=250%2C132&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=645%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71846\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?resize=365%2C192\" alt=\"Petco Park, the home of the San Diego Padres who have two world series appearances, both losses, in team history.

The Padres proceeded to lose ten straight games into the month of September, a historic collapse that left them clinging to the top of the division by a thread.</p>\n<p>After leading the NL West for 148 days of the season, the Padres officially relinquished a playoff spot for good to the Giants with a loss on the very last day of the season. San Francisco went on to win the World Series while the Padres went home and haven’t had a winning season since.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of these finishes left me reeling from a combination of grief and rage that lasted intensely for a minimum of weeks and then slowly worked into my overall emotional impression of San Diego pro sports. It’s memories like these that have left me cynical and demoralized regarding the topic, but not without hope.</span></p>\n<p>No, never without hope. The hope is what keeps me alive. Every new season without fail brings fresh dreams that maybe, just maybe, this could be the year that everything changes. Maybe, just maybe, this could be the year that America’s finest city captures its first-ever modern pro sports title.</p>\n<p>2016 probably isn’t that year. Seeing as the 2015-16 NFL season already concluded with the Chargers well out of playoff contention and the 2016 MLB season is about halfway done with the Padres mired in a sixth straight losing season, the title drought is almost assuredly extending to an extraordinary 54 years.=</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, hey, if Cleveland can finally get theirs, maybe our time is coming soon, too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or maybe not.</span></p>\n<p>Just give me one before I die, San Diego. Please.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71843\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-08/the-hard-life-of-a-san-diego-sports-fan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71843\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-08/the-hard-life-of-a-san-diego-sports-fan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-08/the-hard-life-of-a-san-diego-sports-fan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-08/the-hard-life-of-a-san-diego-sports-fan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-08/the-hard-life-of-a-san-diego-sports-fan/","id":3318,"author":{"id":318,"name":"Duncan MacPhee"},"related":[3317,3316,3315],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Season, New Hope","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hqdefault.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hqdefault.jpg?resize=480%2C360&ssl=1","description":"Staff Writer Liam Bailey discusses the offseason moves made by the Utah Jazz and Houston Rockets that could lead to a very successful season for both teams.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img data-attachment-id=\"66614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/flip-minnesotas-hometown-hero/around-the-nba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"around the nba\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-66614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=770%2C161\" alt=\"around the nba\" width=\"770\" height=\"161\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p><strong><em>The Anti-Warriors Continue Their Ascent </em> </strong></p>\n<p>The Utah Jazz desperately want back into the playoffs and seem destined to get there this year with a series of additions that perfectly fill out their roster.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

With Hill and Exum receiving most of the playing time at the point, the Jazz will now offer 48 minutes of impactful defense at the spot where they started Raul Neto and Shelvin Mack, mixed with a heavy dosage of Trey Burke, in 2015-16.</p>\n<p>Though Neto and Mack weren’t awful on that end, there’s no doubt that Hill and Exum will be a vast improvement.</p>\n<p>Signing Joe Johnson for two years and $22 million is perfect for a young team in need of veteran leadership and shooting, both of which Johnson offers in spades. Some secondary and tertiary play initiation will be helpful for bench-heavy units, and Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors will easily mask his defensive deficiencies at the rim.</p>\n<p>Pair him with Boris Diaw (acquired from the Spurs in a move to clear space), familiar with Gobert from their time on the French national team, and the youthful team has two old heads to navigate the Jazz to a playoff return at relatively low cost.</p>\n<p>The Jazz will struggle to keep up with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on the perimeter, there’s no doubt, but dominating the Warriors on the boards and scaring them away from the rim has proved a decent tactic in the past.</p>\n<p>The Warriors kryptonite might be a more switch everything approach, with big guards capable of hounding Durant or Draymond Green in short stretches, or it might not exist at all, but the Jazz have added steady contributors to a roster already fairly well-suited to establish itself among the Western Conference elites, and as the Warriors’ toughest competition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>7 Seconds or Less Comes to Houston</em></strong><em> </em></p>\n<p>The Rockets were a massive disappointment last season after many picked them as the second or third best team in the Western Conference.

Gordon will presumably come off the bench, though it wouldn’t be shocking to see D’Antoni start James Harden as his point guard next season. He’s a better offensive player than Beverley, more versatile and a better shooter, and D’Antoni has proven a strong defensive unit is not his priority.</p>\n<p>Ryan Anderson has the shooting that both Morey and D’Antoni crave at the power forward position, but back injuries have left his future in question. Anderson earning $21 million in his age 28 season is concerning, as the success of the contract will be totally reliant on his ability to stay healthy. He will open the paint for the Harden, Clint Capela pick-and-roll, a play with deadly potential on a spaced floor.</p>\n<p>The question for both Anderson and Gordon, teammates for the past few seasons in New Orleans, is whether or not they can contribute to a competent defense. The Rockets’ offense should be a joy to watch, but it’s not assured that Houston, juiced up on D’Antoni, will have a defense strong enough to stay much above 500. Harden should lead the team back to the playoffs, but a top-five seed seems like a stretch.</p>\n<p>Capela should be in store for a dominant breakout season; a talented rim runner, he has the perfect skill set to run the type of offense Dwight Howard stalled in his time as a Rocket. He’ll set strong screens for Harden, and has a knack for finishing inside, shooting over 66 percent at the rim in both of his first two NBA seasons.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71982\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71982\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-26/new-season-new-hope/","id":3319,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[3318,3317,3316],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
