External Vice President of Local Affairs, Alex Moore said he will improve safety conditions in Isla Vista through a new Bluelight smart phone application that allows students to make faster emergency calls. Moore also said he will advocate “Keep It Local” campaigns for Halloween and Deltopia, and added that he will institute student lobbying efforts at the local, countywide level.</p>\n<p>“I talked about maybe having student lobby type conference things, where students actually speak to the Board of Supervisors and students express their concerns directly to them,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>These efforts could tackle Isla Vista’s most controversial issues and laws, such as the Social Host Ordinance. The Bluelight application being spearheaded by Moore allows users to push a button to send an emergency warning, and it automatically sends user location and personal information to a friend or to 911. The device has already proven successful, reducing police response time by as much as 44 percent at other campuses, Moore said.</p>\n<p><strong><img data-attachment-id=\"51500\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-21/a-s-to-swear-in-next-years-executive-officers/alexandria-choate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"150,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alexandria Choate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-51500 alignleft\" alt=\"Alexandria Choate\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">External Vice President of Statewide Affairs – EVPSA </strong></p>\n<p>Alex Choate said she plans to reach out to a greater, more diverse portion of students as External Vice President of Statewide Affairs.

Whittaker said Haile’s objectivity has been called into question by his decision to hold a stance on the issue of divestment.</p>\n<p>“Just the mere fact he was there in solidarity with one side or the other, definitely doesn’t seem the right message for the office,” Whittaker said. Whittaker said he hopes to make the Office of the Student Advocate General more objective and neutral, and on the issue of diversity, he said the current office achieves “physical” diversity but lacks more “mental” diversity.

Groups will compete for the funds, with the two best project proposals receiving $5,000 each.</p>\n<p>A.S. Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez, the architect behind the legislation, said the federal failure to invest in innovation initially inspired him to propose the fund.</p>\n<p>“NASA has no funding now. The United States is ranked 22nd in science and technology. That’s appalling,” Martinez said. “We can’t compete with countries on the rise like India and China when it comes to this kind of stuff.”</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, having student government support the sciences would help rekindle the innovative spirit of the United States.</p>\n<p>“$10,000 isn’t a lot, but it helps a bit,” Martinez said. “It helps contribute to people wanting to do something outside of the classroom and hopefully be like, ‘Maybe I can work on this for the federal government in the future.’”</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, president of UCSB’s Residence Halls Association, added that STARK allows A.S. to support and reach out to science and engineering students.</p>\n<p>“Students who work in the science-technology field on campus are really underserved by A.S.,” Abboud said. “A.S. does a lot to benefit certain groups, but one of the groups that A.S. hasn’t aided to — as much as other groups — is the science population.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the lack of dissent the bill faced from the Senate signified the widespread acknowledgement of its importance.</p>\n<p>“We don’t see a lot of engineers and we don’t see a lot of hard-science people in A.S.,” Martinez said. “A.S. has no form of grants that we give to projects. It’s time that we do that. It’s time that we reach out to those people who want to do hands-on projects … There was no opposition [from the Senate]; I think that shows that people understand the issues at hand.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau, who serves as an off-campus Senator for A.S. and officially proposed the bill to the Senate, pointed out the advantages that STARK could have for students attempting to pad their résumés.</p>\n<p>“I really think that this is a great direction that A.S. is going into, because … we’re also helping career paths,” Lau said. “Really when it comes down to it, your résumé is kind of everything.”</p>\n<p>Lau said she hopes to eventually expand the idea to other fields of study, making student government funds more accessible for academic pursuits.</p>\n<p>“It would really help to expand it to even writing groups — people who are English or art majors who want to publish art magazines and writing magazines,” Lau said. “It’s a great avenue to have money specifically for students to do things that will benefit their future.”</p>\n<p>However, Abboud said he feels that it is most important to address science-focused organizations, since these groups are most underrepresented in A.S.</p>\n<p>“We kind of already do fund different things … I don’t think that we should create another fund specifically for them,” Abboud said. “It’s better to have a specific one for science and technology, because they don’t feel right now that A.S. helps and caters to them … It’s good to put that institutional backing to the science groups.”</p>\n<p>Raul Martinez plans to contact every Office of Student Life organization that is science-related within the next week as the beginning steps of the $5,000 competition. The bill will go into effect next year.</p>\n<h6><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the February 6th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50149\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50149\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/","id":3109,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3108,3107,3106],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Off-Campus Senator Alex Choate represented the Open People’s Party (OPP). The forum centered on issues ranging from how the future EVPSA would reach out to the UC Board of Regents to addressing the needs of undocumented students studying within the UC.</p>\n<p>In dealing with the UC Office of the President tax that was introduced last year, which requires all UC campuses to pay a 1.69 percent fee on all revenue-earning funding streams — including student-funded campus groups — Orozco said she was at the UCSA Congress when the UCOP initially introduced the fee.</p>\n<p>According to Orozco, the UCOP tax is an unjust financial strain on students, and as such, she said she will protest it by pressuring Chancellor Henry Yang to compile legislation in opposition to it.</p>\n<p>“I was there with the current UCSB President Sophia Armen when they were speaking to us about initiating the tax, and I was very vocally against it,” Orozco said. “After that, I was part of a group that organized rallies against it and put together an education campaign …[Student fees are] something we’ve decided to vote on and tax ourselves on. I will continue to actively voice against it.”</p>\n<p>However, Choate said the A.S. Senate has already passed a resolution calling for Chancellor Yang to stop the tax.</p>\n<p>“I sit on the student Senate, and we actually passed a resolution urging Chancellor Yang not to [tax],” Choate said. “And currently, as of right now, he has approved to not tax students once again this year…However, we have to work and look forward to next year and our future generations of students.”</p>\n<p>Following the EVPSA elections forum, the three candidates for the next A.S. President took the stage to debate issues ranging from topics of special projects on campus to broader subjects, like the interpretation of the top A.S. executive’s responsibilities.</p>\n<p>RHA President Jonathan Abboud debated as the OPP candidate, while Residential Advisor Megan Foronda spoke as the DP candidate and Patrick “Mac” Kennedy represented himself as an independent, non-partisan candidate.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, the role of the A.S. president is to be an advocate of the students and to effectively communicate with UCSB administration. Abboud said he has three focal points that tackle all issues relevant to the A.S. presidency — University affairs, campus culture and the role of fiscally responsible management of A.S. funds.</p>\n<p>“First, strengthening higher education in California, we must unite together. Students, workers, faculty, staff and alumni must be united in our defense of higher education in California because students alone cannot win this fight,” Abboud said. “Second, campus culture is important to me. I think UCSB has a lacking campus culture, and A.S. should be instrumental in building new campus traditions…My last focal point is fiscal responsibility. You pay $180 every quarter into A.S. and you deserve to see every single dollar of that money. I want to take the leftover money and refund it back to you at the end of the year.”</p>\n<p>If elected as A.S. President, Foronda said she would work with both university administration as well as students, and said she plans to focus primarily on issues such as protesting UC tuition increases and assuring there is fair representation of all communities on campus.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to priorities, you must prioritize students first, especially in terms of higher education. When it comes to tuition hikes, students are out there advocating for themselves. I want to ensure that funding continues to go to student organizations that do work on this campus,” Foronda said. “When it comes to empowerment, I want to ensure that students themselves feel empowered in every space they are in. When we talk about campus climate, I want to make sure that marginalized communities feel safe on this campus and make sure that their voices are represented in these larger institutions.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said he sees the role of A.S. President as someone who would unite the student body and reach out to students who are not members of A.S. Essentially, Kennedy said he is running on three main points — reducing tuition, ending A.S. corruption and improving campus climate.</p>\n<p>“I would make sure to reduce tuition. I’m the only candidate that has experience lobbying in Sacramento and that has developed relationships with key legislators,” Kennedy said. “I want to reform corruption in A.S. Currently, the five executives are using your student fees to pay for their own tuition — that’s corruption. That’s $4,500 and I’ll make sure that goes back to you. We could bring Kendrick Lamar here, J. Cole, Jack Johnson, anybody with that kind of money…I want to improve campus climate here. We need to get every single student involved somehow in this campus. We need to unify the gaucho experience.”</p>\n<p>Voting starts next week on GOLD, beginning on April 22 at 8 a.m. and ending at 4 p.m. on April 25.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"494842485\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50895\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/acclaimed-author-to-discuss-science-social-effects-of-malaria/forum-william-zhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Forum William Zhou\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50888\" alt=\"Forum William Zhou\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>WILLIAM ZHOU / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A.S.

The Executive Board also jointly proposed to tack on additional changes that would allow Elections Committee to disqualify candidates for ethical reasons.</p>\n<p>Elections Committee Chair Hannah Yen said the revisions were made after the committee conceded that imposing a limit on the recruitment period was not realistic.</p>\n<p>“In the recruitment section, recruitment is no longer having restrictions,” Yen said. “We don’t want to punish people. And realistically, if it’s happening, then we want to allow for that in the code … We are trying to do the best we can to accommodate what we think is best for the students and for you all.”</p>\n<p>However, second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja said dropping the additional changes would result in the committee not holding parties accountable for their actions.</p>\n<p>“It sounds like you’re addressing that there is a problem and basically just conceding to that,” Ahuja said. “I’m kind of confused about how this actually solves anything.”</p>\n<p>Yen said her goal is to make the elections process as open to student involvement as possible.</p>\n<p>“Different violations come up, different campaign strategies come up,” Yen said. “So we are always trying to make the process as fair and impartial as possible, and as open as possible and accessible to students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Sophia Armen said the Executive Board’s proposal would give Elections Committee the power to disqualify students for the use of A.S. funds for personal affairs, the deliberate and public misrepresentation of the association and other ethical issues.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Yoel Haile said the responsibility to ensure that candidates were indicted for ethical violations fairly would lie with the Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>“We believe this to be the baseline … of what kind of ethical parameters should elected folks be held to. We’ve thought very long and hard about this,” Haile said. “If the Judicial Council finds that the student is responsible for violating these codes as the baseline, that Elections Committee be empowered to disqualify that student.”</p>\n<p>Many Senators brought up concerns with the proposal. Off-Campus Senator Kyley Scarlet said it should be in the hands of the students to judge the character of each candidate, rather than the association.</p>\n<p>“Shouldn’t the student body be the ones deciding the moral standards of their leaders, not this code?” Scarlet asked.</p>\n<p>Yen said the Elections committee does not endorse the Executive Board’s proposal.</p>\n<p>“The Committee does not want this in our code because we do not feel that this is part of our charge,” Yen said. “I hope that you take into account the fact that this is not something we wanted.”</p>\n<p>Rhandy Siordia, External Vice President of Local Affairs, said the new ideas came about as a result of issues that have occurred in past elections.</p>\n<p>“This is indeed a response. It would be a response to historical precedent,” Siordia said. “Has [an infraction like the ones mentioned in the proposal] happened in the past? Yes.”</p>\n<p>After hours of debate, including a ‘working meeting’ in which the Senate abandoned the restrictions of the official meeting process and talked through the ideas in a circle on the floor, Senators passed the changes proposed by Elections Committee, but did not approve the ethics requirement proposed by the Executive Officers.</p>\n<p>After the Senate passed a resolution that would support CALPIRG in an effort to repeal the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Citizens United v. FEC, three Senators exited the room abruptly, leaving the Senate without the requisite number of members present to adjourn the meeting. Next week, Senate will resume where it left off in this week’s agenda.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the February 8th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/","id":3111,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3110,3109,3108],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
