","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running an Isla Vista storefront is not all lattes and catchy names — businesses can be forced to hibernate for long stretches at a time when UC Santa Barbara is not in session, as thousands of students clear out during breaks throughout the year, oftentimes for weeks. With fewer customers, fewer employees and the high price of rent to pay for the “ideal location,” it comes as no surprise that many businesses in Isla Vista can struggle to stay afloat during these time periods. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92009\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92009\" data-attachment-id=\"92009\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/how-isla-vista-businesses-survive-the-long-winter/woodstocks_kaiyi-yang_online/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Woodstocks_Kaiyi Yang_ONLINE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92009 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Woodstocks_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92009\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses have found that in recent years, the gamble to stay open has proved to be more and more successful. </span><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many established places in I.V. have the hard choice of whether to cut their losses and close for break, or try and stay open, according to Boxi Wang, owner of Mojo Teahouse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do compare sales data from previous year[s] and also look at the demographic of [the] current academic year to reach a decision on if we should be open or not,” Wang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang said Mojo Teahouse has used UCSB demographics, along with analysis of their own financial statistics, to help them predict the loss or benefit of staying open. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of retail lots available in I.V. also gives the illusion of businesses having a monopoly on the population, Wang added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People tend to look at the bright side, such as a huge student population in close proximity,” Wang said. “They need to realize that being in I.V. also has many downsides like higher retail rent, minimal share of the Goleta market and a more challenging workforce to manage.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on foot traffic alone, businesses typically can have high expectations for revenue, which helps enable high rent prices for businesses, Troy Yamasaki, the general manager of Cajé, said. But winter break brings a decrease in customers, and despite the density in population, college students can turn out to be a much more difficult demographic to break into,  Yamasaki explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Yamasaki, this is because students often have limited resources and have a higher standard for what they are willing to spend money on and the value they are getting. Businesses struggle to meet this standard at a price that pays the bills, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high cost of living also makes it hard for businesses to have sufficient time to establish the roots they need to develop a following, especially for smaller businesses, according to Darien Nisbett, marketing representative at Woodstock’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would imagine it is difficult to generate the sales necessary to pay your employees a living wage and eliminate turnover in that sense as well,” Nisbett added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, winter break brings the challenge of finding people to work; UCSB or Santa Barbara Community College students make up the majority of employees — Nisbett said students make up 90% of employees at Woodstock’s, which means they often go home for breaks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closing the store can bring more benefits than keeping it open; maintaining a healthy store is not simply about cash flow but also maintaining an enjoyable and inviting atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take this time to update the restaurant … [We] see an increase in business in-store from families in the surrounding areas and businesses in Goleta, as well as deliveries,” Nisbett added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses have found that in recent years, the gamble to stay open has proved to be more and more successful. Yamasaki said he has noticed an increasing number of students who choose to stay over break. And as these businesses have developed a more consistent customer base, they can rely on some of these students to still support the store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We stayed open almost the whole break and we gained some understanding that many </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international and out-of-state students are still here. They appreciate having some place to hang out and eat,” Wang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides winter break, summer also proves challenging to businesses, which often find profits to be cut in half for three months out of the year. But this trend appears to also be shifting slightly, according to Yamasaki.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot more students seem to be taking summer school. The UC keeps admitting more students and I think it encourages just generally higher populations and people that will visit during the summer,” Yamasaki said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Wang, one way for unestablished businesses to manage and learn to thrive in I.V. year round is to refine methods during breaks and summers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not even the initial capital to start a business, but the capital it takes on your personal life to really almost be a martyr to the business for a few years until it establishes those solid roots,” Yamasaki added.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

That playoff run was truly a Cinderella story, one that ended too soon, without an NCAA championship, but gave much hope for the future.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward one year later, and if 2016 was a Cinderella story, then 2017 for UCSB was a fall back to reality.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into 2017, Santa Barbara was expected to finish at least third in the conference and was actually ranked coming into the year at No. 19 in the country. Of course, nothing went as expected. The Gauchos would go on to finish with a very disappointing 24-32 overall record and a Big West worst 8-16 conference mark.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

While Checketts is known for his ability to build a solid pitching staff, injuries played a huge factor in the Gauchos’ inability to put together a solid rotation for the entirety of the campaign.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team last year, the Gauchos bullpen accumulated a 5.24 ERA, the second-worst mark in the Big West. That mark was also ranked 183 out of the 295 NCAA D-I programs. This year, UCSB hopes to turn this around as it returns some good arms while also adding a couple to the rotation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior right-handed pitcher Noah Davis returns for his third year at Santa Barbara, one he hopes can bring some health to his résumé. As the primary Friday starter last season, the Huntington Beach native posted a 7-4 record in 13 starts with a 4.63 ERA.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He finished with a career-high in strikeouts with 65 but did battle injuries throughout the year. If all is well health-wise, Davis should resume as the Friday starter.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with him, the bullpen returns midweek starter, Ben Brecht. The true sophomore posted a 3.99 ERA in 14 appearances, eight of them starts along with tallying a 4-2 record. Another key returner is Chris Lincoln. In 28 innings, the sophomore gave up 31 hits and 15 earned runs, but showcased a well of talent in the strikeout department, tallying 25.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Brecht and Lincoln will hope to showcase more talent this year, fans seem to know what to expect out of senior right-hander Stevie Ledesma. The backyard kid, plucked from SBCC, was always the first call in a decisive game and he didn’t disappoint.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though his 2-5 record is a bit disappointing, the senior tallied 57 strikeouts in just 43.2 innings pitched. Of course, with a lot of strikeouts comes to a lot of opportunities to hit some stuff at the plate. Ledesma had a 6.80 ERA and gave up six dingers, tied for second-most on the team.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newcomers to the pen are redshirt freshman Jack Dashwood and Chris Troye. Dashwood was the cream of the crop of a wonderful recruiting class two seasons ago but sat out the 2017 campaign due to injury.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Troye, his story is a bit more interesting. Brought in as a catcher, the true freshman has shown some ability to be a pitcher. The Brentwood native has pitched to speeds of 97 mph, showing promise. Now let’s see if he can put it together in a real game.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batting wise, the Gauchos are also in a precarious position. UCSB lost two of its top three batters in terms of batting average including Austin Bush, whose 20 home runs set a new program record last season.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Santa Barbara still retains a lot of talent. Redshirt sophomore Tommy Jew batted .295 last season and had the second most RBI’s on the team with 30. The center fielder is also very talented defensively, thus setting the stage for him to have a breakout year.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of a breakout year, sophomore Armani Smith is due for one big time. The outfielder showed tremendous promise last season batting .285 and slugging .397, but even more, promising is how hard his swing is.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other key returners are the Louisville slugger Sam Cohen, who had eight home runs last season, and shortstop Clay Fisher, who will not be playing the field until his shoulder has completely healed but will see some action at the plate as a DH.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team who stands in the way of the Gauchos on opening weekend is San Diego State, a team who won 42 games last season and a Mountain West Championship.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aztecs are in the same position as the Gauchos were last season, hoping to exceed expectations following a tremendous season. Defeating UCSB in a best of three series to begin the year would be a good gauge of where the team is at early, something the coach himself alluded to.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior shortstop David Hensley and sophomore right-handed pitcher Logan Boyer are two notable returners for the Aztecs and were also named to the 2018 all-MW preseason team. The team was picked to finish second.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Gauchos will be facing a tough team to open the season, the most important thing for them is working on what they can get better at. This early in the season, nothing is set in stone. This is a team that is comprised of solid returners, but if it wants to excel, it needs another Armani Smith to step up in their first year of collegiate action.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of what happens this weekend, one thing is for certain; Checketts and the team have put last year behind them. With that brings hope that we can be cheering this team on at Omaha come mid-June.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB opens its season against San Diego State at 6 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 16 at Tony Gwynn Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

CSD) reached out to Lucidity about a festival designed to steer people away from Del Playa Drive and increase safety precautions during Deltopia, Lucidity presented its plan to the I.V. CSD board in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/i-v-csd-considers-turning-deltopia-into-a-sanctioned-festival/\">early October</a>. Since then, the I.V. CSD has been engaged in negotiations with various community stakeholders — law enforcement, UC Santa Barbara, County Public Works and Lucidity — to determine the feasibility and necessity of the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late October, Lucidity cut the budget for the proposal </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/lucidity-festival-budget-reduced-by-20000-following-district-concerns/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by $20,000</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, following district concerns that the price tag for the festival would be too much for the district to shoulder alone. Lucidity also hosted a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/lucidity-fields-community-questions-about-alternative-deltopia-festival-during-town-hall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in early November to answer questions and clear misconceptions regarding the festival, emphasizing that its purpose is to channel crowds away from Del Playa Drive into a safer space, not to replace Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In mid-November, the I.V. CSD delayed its decision on the proposal to December after noting a number of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/i-v-csd-vote-for-lucidity-festival-on-deltopia-postponed-to-december/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“outstanding issues”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the contract, particularly with the police presence needed at the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just don’t think that on the current timeline we’ll be able to accomplish our goals and so it’s one of those things where we should not pull the trigger if we’re not 100% sped-up and ready,” Board President Spencer Brandt said during Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel that the best way to move forward is to set a target date for 2021 and to move forward with [the] group of stakeholders,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sara Marvel, a director for Lucidity, stressed the timeliness of the plan’s approval when it was first proposed in October, so that preparations could be made in time for the spring. She had hoped for a contract’s approval in a week’s time, but negotiations with various parties stretched to more than a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the delay, however, “Lucidity is at the point where they’re willing to step back and withdraw their proposal for this year and try to work with us to try and find where best they can be plugged in,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that although plans for the spring festival were pushed back to 2021, the I.V. CSD intends to work with UCSB to host an alternative event in I.V., such as the university’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/police-ucsb-administration-local-government-prepare-for-deltopia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SunFest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — a festival held in Storke Plaza as an alternative to Deltopia for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Abboud, general manager for the I.V. CSD, said he is in contact with Katya Armistead, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">assistant vice chancellor for student affairs and dean of student life, to potentially open SunFest to I.V. residents who don’t attend UCSB, but the I.V. CSD still needs to meet with both UCSB and Lucidity to see where the two entities stand on the idea, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity will still be in the picture and the I.V. CSD has “spoken with them about the possible use of the Guardians,” a security team focused on harm reduction, for a possible “alternative event in Isla Vista this year,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the original proposal to the I.V. CSD, the </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardianteam.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guardians</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played a key role in emphasizing the need for safety precautions for Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Craig Bonner, chief deputy for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, the office is “absolutely dedicated” to turning Deltopia into a safer event and is willing to help put safety measures in place for this upcoming Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anything we can do to help mitigate the unsanctioned aspects of Deltopia is a good thing and obviously if we can get people into a controlled environment where they are safe, that is an excellent thing,” Bonner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The negotiations for the spring festival opened a much larger conversation on the safety issues seen at large events in I.V. and the I.V. CSD’s ability in tackling them, Brandt said at Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While these are fun events for many of our residents, there are many of our residents that are made to be victims by crime, by sexual assault during these large events and there is an abnormally high number of people who are hospitalized as a result of alcohol and drugs during these events,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deltopia 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> saw a spike in attendees, citations and arrests, but a decrease in medical transports; the majority of arrests were for disorderly conduct due to alcohol.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Deltopia is] one of the biggest public safety issues in our community and it’s also something that is absolutely revered by so many of the people who live here. It’s a tricky line to walk, but we have to be resolute in bringing these issues forward,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Dec. 14, 12:53 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Lucidity first proposed the plan to the I.V.

This is the second of the six consecutive home series Santa Barbara has over the next month and a half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host the Bobcats with just an 4-7 overall mark but does boast a solid 3-1 home record. The visiting team is 7-4 on the year and has played just one road game this season, against Rice University, and lost 8-6. This is the first ever match-up between these two programs.</p>\n<p>UCSB comes into this weekend with a very exciting possibility. While difficult, if it could sweep Texas State, then it would be back to an even record at 7-7 and just like that it is back to being in a power position to try to get back to good form.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>What will Santa Barbara need to make this happen? Simple, it will need good pitching.</p>\n<p>In their four wins this season the Gauchos have given up an average of three runs per outing. In their seven losses, they have given up 6.71 runs per game. Conversely, in wins, UCSB scores 7.35 runs while in losses it only bats in 3.3 runs per game.</p>\n<p>Overall, the key word for Santa Barbara is consistency. If it can become a more consistent team in all facets of play then it will have much more success. Being at home certainly helps a young team like them to become more consistent.</p>\n<p>At home, the ‘Chos bat .307 at the plate, .394 slugging with and have a .404 on-base percentage. They also have double the RBI’s at home (22) then on the road (11) despite having played one less game in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Strikeouts have also been a problem for UCSB this season especially early in the season. After it’s first series of the season, Santa Barbara already accumulated 35 strikeouts. Additionally, UCSB has struck out 79 times on the road compared to just 22 at home.</p>\n<p>If the point hasn’t been driven home already, it is that Santa Barbara has a really good opportunity not just this weekend but in its next 18 of 19 games which will be at home.</p>\n<p>Key players that the Gauchos have relied on this season at the plate includes redshirt juniors Clay Fisher and Thomas Rowan.</p>\n<p>Despite not having been fully healed from his injury to play his normal shortstop position, Fisher has not missed a beat when up to bat. He currently slashes a very efficient .306/.340/.388. Rowan is the teams leader in batting average hitting .333 at the plate. He and Fisher are the only two Gauchos batting above .300.</p>\n<p>For Texas State, their normal Friday starting pitcher has been a beast which will make it difficult for the ‘Chos to get the first victory of the series. Sophomore right-handed pitcher Nicholas Fraze currently owns a 2-1 record and has a 0.93 ERA and 18 strikeouts on the season.</p>\n<p>Senior Dylan Paul has been getting it done for the Bobcats on the offensive side of the game. Last weekend, he led the Bobcats at the plate with a .545 average (6-for-11).  The utility also added in four runs and hit a walk-off triple in the series finale.</p>\n<p>For the season, he leads the team with a .395 (17-for-43) batting average. The 2018 Preseason All-Sun Belt Conference First Team has also batted in eight runs and holds a solid .938 fielding percentage.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has 18 of its next 19 games at home and so far it has taken advantage of that opportunity but it cannot stop there. UCSB is still a program on the rise despite a sub-par last season but that will not be true forever if it cannot return to its former glory.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Texas State in the first of a three-game series at 2 p.m. on Friday, March 9th at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
