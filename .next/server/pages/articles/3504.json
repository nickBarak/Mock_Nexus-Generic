I’m not saying you should regularly run around looking like a slut, because I will judge you then. But to do so in the privacy of your room? You go, Glenn Coco.</p>\n<p>We’ve all fantasized about being the sexy librarian, naughty schoolgirl, busty nurse, elusive Playboy bunny … the list goes on, and I guarantee your study buddy is dying to help you work your way down it. And up it. And through it … in the projection room above the auditorium.</p>\n<p>Make it as extensive or short-lived as you want. Role playing is hot as hell. Channel our favorite Brits, David Beckham and Posh Spice — you know you’ve thought about how great their sex has to be — and you’ll be fornicating like never before … all fierce and repulsively good-looking. And I’m not talking about soccer when I say bend it like Beckham. Spice up your life people — just like math, sex is the same in every country.</p>\n<p>There’s something about role playing that’s somewhat insightful. Your closet sex addict has a way of surfacing under the facade of your character and its honestly quite liberating — you may never admit to yourself that you have that alter ego (Boo, you whore), so the seductive burlesque costume is the perfect disguise.</p>\n<p>When it comes down to it, we all love Halloween. There’s a reason we’re already plotting next year’s scantily clad outfits. So, why wait a full year to dress up when you’ve got a perfectly good excuse to do so in the bedroom?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42460\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/trick-treat-halloween-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42460\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/trick-treat-halloween-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/trick-treat-halloween-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/trick-treat-halloween-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/trick-treat-halloween-year/","id":3504,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3503,3502,3501],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[1843,3129,3259,3502,3503,3504,3507,3508,3509,3518,3526,3536,3579,3646,4290,7849],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"An Athlete of All Arenas","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/milne.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/milne.png?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"Looking back over Ruth Milne’s career, it’s hard to imagine that at one point she was only a few dollars away from never touching a water polo ball.   The junior goalkeeper broke UCSB’s all...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>Looking back over Ruth Milne’s career, it’s hard to imagine that at one point she was only a few dollars away from never touching a water polo ball.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The junior goalkeeper broke UCSB’s all-time saves record just two games into her junior season and now has 904 saves as a Gaucho.

In fact, it was never her idea to play.</p>\n<p>“My dad actually forced me to play water polo,” Milne said. “He told me he would pay me to go to practice.”</p>\n<p>Before Milne turned to water polo, she was a basketball player and had also played soccer. At 5’11”, she has the height to play a post position in basketball and as a goalkeeper, which was her position when she played soccer. When she got to high school, she had to choose whether she wanted to keep playing basketball or give water polo a try. In the end, she chose the pool over the court, the net over the hoop.</p>\n<p>“I hated [water polo] for about the first two weeks,” Milne said. “After that I started to really get into it.”</p>\n<p>Though Milne was a great player in high school, her team failed to meet the standard she set. According to her, the only reason colleges took notice of and recruited her was because she played club water polo and for the national team. And once she did start the process of deciding where to play in college, UCSB was not at the top of her list.</p>\n<p>“I was originally getting recruited to Stanford and bigger schools, and I always assumed that I would be going to a bigger school like UCLA or Stanford, but some of them backed away because of my grades,” Milne said.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Milne, the high school goalie class that she graduated with was extremely talented, which limited the schools that would recruit her. It was her desire to play and improve that drew her to UCSB. The Gaucho coaching staff promised her a chance to play right away and she jumped at it.</p>\n<p>“The goalies that did go to bigger schools ended up on the bench their first year, and I don’t think I could have stayed on the team if that happened,” Milne said. “This was also the friendliest and most inviting team I visited on my recruiting tour. If I had the chance, I would make the same choice again.”</p>\n<p>It was her work ethic and desire to play that also drew UCSB’s coaches to Milne.</p>\n<p>“When she came in, I knew she wanted to go to a school where she would play right away because that was the only way she would progress,” Head Coach Cathy Neushul said. “I watched her play on the junior national team, and she was absolutely the one we wanted. I did have a choice, but the feedback I got from her coaches drew us to her.”</p>\n<p>Playing every day for UCSB has turned Milne into the player and athlete she is today and has led her to all her accomplishments in the sport, including setting UCSB’s new all-time save record.</p>\n<p>“I was kind of frustrated because I really wanted to break it my sophomore year, but we had to forfeit like five games,” Milne said. “It was really exciting when it did happen. I actually didn’t know anything about [the record] until near the end of my sophomore year.”</p>\n<p>Playing every day has also turned her into the leader that she is today. As a goalie, she is the team’s anchor, and every day she works to fill that role as best she can and do what she can for the team.</p>\n<p>“The main thing about Ruth is she definitely has a work ethic that is unparalleled,” Neushul said. “If she makes a mistake, she can immediately get herself and her team refocused. If I had to have one person lead me into battle, it would be her.”</p>\n<p>Yet even now, three years and 904 saves later, Milne’s life is still not all about water polo. Fierce competitor though she is in the pool, outside of water polo, she is a very easygoing person.</p>\n<p>“I love watching movies because I’m a film major,” Milne said. “Water polo kind of takes over my life, but I really like just hanging out with my friends and teammates.”</p>\n<p>At first, balancing school, water polo and a social life proved difficult, but Milne eventually settled in.</p>\n<p>“It was really hard my freshman year,” Milne said. “I struggled a lot making the change. All the girls are really helpful and encouraging. It’s just something you get used to. It’s like having a job; it’s preparing me for life after college.”</p>\n<p>Though she still has one more year left at UCSB, during which she is guaranteed to surpass 1,000 career saves, Milne is already beginning to plan for a future when she’ll no longer defend the net for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been talking to some friends who played abroad and to my parents, and I’m thinking about playing professionally in Europe,” Milne said. “Playing professional water polo isn’t too difficult because it’s kind of a small sport, though it is bigger in Europe than America. Or, maybe I’ll go to grad school.”</p>\n<p>But before she leaves, Milne still has unfinished business at UCSB.

You can be a firecracker in the sheets, a sensual god(dess), a carnal connoisseur or, to put it bluntly, just damn good at sex — but that by no means prepares you for the dreaded small talk as you’re both waking up and becoming intensely aware of just how naked you are.</p>\n<p>Although charming moments like these may spur the desire to vow abstinence and get thee to a nunnery — I guess Shakespeare understood? — it’s easier to just laugh it off and accept that, in a decade or three, you’ll probably stop blushing, and he or she won’t remember that your exiting phrase was “later, skater.”</p>\n<p>After three years of this shit, I’ve pretty much concluded that I gravitate toward all things awkward. In fact, I may be a bit of a masochist if the definition includes the desire to humiliate oneself to an unreasonable extent in front of as many people as possible, in the strangest way imaginable.</p>\n<p>My junior year, I fell off a bunk bed mid-hookup, cascading off a dresser and landing on a side table, waking up his alarmed roommate, who was probably wondering why some spastic girl was going on a rampage around their room.</p>\n<p>Another time I was dancing at a party and things were getting sweaty (since I’m not one of those inhuman girls who won’t even gently perspire at the gym). Everything was going smoothly until I felt one half of my adhesive bra slide off and, not knowing what to do, ripped of the entire thing and shoved it in my pocket. This almost went unnoticed, until I looked down and saw that the left boob had fallen on the ground and attached to the shoe of the guy I was dancing with. It’s all a bit of a blur now, but in the next few moments my instincts took over and I ended up rushing off before we had to discuss why I’d just torn a boob off his foot.</p>\n<p>But my finest hour by far was one afternoo­n when I was coming out of the morning’s thick delirium that causes me to take on one of many wildly inappropriate, hungover alter-egos. Afternoon goodbyes are much more risky than morning ones because the night’s intoxicants have almost worn off entirely and you’re likely to run into 20 or so acquaintances on your way home. At the very least, I expected the stretch from the bedroom to the front door to be painless, until I emerged into the living room, looking like I’d just returned from the war, only to be greeted by a standing ovation of five to 10 guys. The welcoming parade didn’t end at the door though — they followed me outside, chanting my name and fist-pumping as I sprint-walked down the street, entertaining Bagel Café diners and a house full of laughing college boys, sending me off the classy way.</p>\n<p>So we all rack up a few gems after years of navigating the I.V. hookup culture. I’m here to tell you to just relax, and possibly even relish in the fact that you have some funny ones under your belt.

Alongside “U Can Study Buzzed,” we’re boasting the nicknames “University of Casual Sex and Beer” and “UCSTD.” As soon as I got accepted, the rumors of one in four STI-infected students plagued me.</p>\n<p>However, according to Malek Guerbaoui, Sex and Relationships liaison at the office of Student Health, the rates for UCSB “are right on par with the national average … going to UCSB results in no higher likelihood of contracting an STI.”</p>\n<p>While waiting in the office of Student Health for an STI test, a few unnerving thoughts come to mind. The first one comes from a story my friend told me about an archaic method of STI testing that involves the insertion of an umbrella-like object into unmentionable parts, only for it to be to pried open and scraped to collect God knows what. The second thought: “What if I actually have something?” I mean, I haven’t had the most active year, mind you, but these test results could change my life in grave and unpredictable ways. I guess HPV wouldn’t be so bad for me, and I know chlamydia can be taken care of easily, but the big ones?

UCSB provides walk-in service for STI testing of HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea: blood is drawn for HIV and syphilis for free if you have USHIP insurance, and there is a $20 fee per urine test for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Urine testing is most effective if one hasn’t urinated for over an hour before the test. The entire test, including registering and waiting, took approximately 20 minutes, though I only had blood drawn.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Student Health center also readily offers other types of tests for STIs, though they require meeting with a physician. HPV, herpes and molluscum contagiosum (warts caused by a poxvirus after direct contact with an affected area) can be treated after a visual exam with a physician. For ladies, vaginal infections such as yeast infections require pelvic exams. Appointments for all of these exams can be made via the UCSB Student Health website.</p>\n<p>Having gone through the process of STI testing, I can tell you that it was easy and well worth it. It is better to know about these things sooner than later, and Guerbaoui suggests that, even if you don’t show any symptoms, an STI test may be worth your while: “the number one symptom of STIs is not having symptoms.”</p>\n<p>Getting regular STI tests is the mature and responsible thing to do, not only for your own health, but also for the health of people with whom you engage in sexual relations. You put them at risk if you put off STI testing.</p>\n<p>The Student Health STI information packet makes one message incredibly clear. Bolded, underlined and italicized: “Condom use can minimize your chances of contracting all of the above infections.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42457\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42457\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-01/ucsb-ucstd/","id":3503,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3502,3501,3500],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
