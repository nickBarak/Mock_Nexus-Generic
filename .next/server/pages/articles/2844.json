Brontsema and the Gaucho coaching staff succeeded in transforming a high school outfielder into a first-team, All-Big West shortstop and third baseman throughout the three years Young was a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“The defensive switch was an important move, and the right move for his career,” Brontsema said.</p>\n<p>Young would eventually prove Brontsema’s tactics to be of value, as he went on to win the Golden Glove award for one of the best defensive players in the MLB while playing shortstop for the Rangers.</p>\n<p>“It was a great accomplishment for him,” Brontsema said. “The award is a testament to his work ethic and drive.”</p>\n<p>Young will use what he learned during his time walking the fields of Caesar Uyesaka stadium today, at AT&amp;T park as a Texas Ranger. First pitch is set for 5 p.m. from San Francisco.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Hall.<em> Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Former Navy Sea, Air, Land Teams (SEAL) soldier and best-selling author Eric Greitens spoke at Campbell Hall on Thursday night on his recently released book<em> Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life</em>, a compilation of 23 letters between Greitens and a former SEAL comrade who was struggling with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>\n<p>Greitens, who was awarded the United States Armed Forces Bronze Star and listed on <em>Fortune</em> magazine’s World’s 50 Greatest Leaders in 2014 and<em> Time</em> magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in 2013, spoke to a crowd of approximately 250 students, faculty, community members and Arts &amp; Lectures donors. Greitens is also a Rhodes Scholar, a White House Fellow and founder and CEO of The Mission Continues, a non-profit organization which challenges veterans to serve and lead in communities across the country.</p>\n<p>Throughout the lecture, Greitens focused on how to grow from personal experiences, stating that growth is necessary to move on from past hardship.</p>\n<p>“You cannot bounce back from hardship. You can only move through it,” Greitens said. “No one escapes pain, fear, and suffering. Yet from pain can come wisdom; from fear can come courage; and from suffering can come strength — if we have the value of resilience.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>When most people think of resilience … we cannot bounce back because we cannot go back in time to the people we used to be. There is no bouncing back. There is only moving through – Eric Greitens</p></blockquote>\n<p>Greitens also discussed the importance of meeting obstacles in order to progress in life and said that, as Navy SEALS, he and his colleagues understood the word “frontline” to mean “the place where we met the enemy,” but frontline is not just a “military term.”</p>\n<p>“In fact, you have a frontline in your life now,” Greitans said. “Everyone has a place where they encounter fear, where they struggle, suffer, and face hardship. … It is on the frontline of our lives that we earn wisdom, create joy, forge friendships, discover happiness, find love and do purposeful work.”</p>\n<p>According to Greitens, the most important factor in dealing with hardship is figuring out to work through life’s challenges.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a place in life where they have to deal with hardship and challenge and pain and difficulty fear,” Greitens said. “But it’s often our ability to navigate those places — of hardship and difficulty — that grow essential to our ability to live life in a purpose, productive and meaningful way.”</p>\n<p>Greitens said he believes resilience is a way of working through hardship rather than returning to a state of being prior to experiencing hardship.</p>\n<p>“When most people think of resilience … we cannot bounce back because we cannot go back in time to the people we used to be. There is no bouncing back. There is only moving through,” Greitens said. “Resilient people do not bounce back from hard experiences. They find healthy ways to integrate them into their lives. In time, people can confront great calamity with great spirit and can create great strength.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major at Golden West College in Huntington Beach Nick Wolfe said he traveled to Goleta, CA., from Anaheim to hear Greitens speak.</p>\n<p>“I’m a fan of his work,” Wolfe said. “I’ve read his past book <em>The Heart and The Fis</em>t and I’ve acquired his other book, which is pretty similar.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don’t have any connections to the military. No family members, no personal experience. But I think the ideas he shared here tonight are relevant to me, too. – Third-year global studies major Codie Franklin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wolfe said he was considering joining the military before he sustained a personal injury, but still enjoys learning about Greitens’ military career.</p>\n<p>“I’ve read the book already and some of the things he did say were verbatim,” Wolfe said. “But he did hit a lot of the more important topics harder on the head as he felt necessary and it was nice to hear it in his voice for the first time. That was awesome. I have respect for humanity and life in general and the way he approaches and sees it is really fascinating. Really, it’s respectable.”</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Herman Li said he attended Greitens’ lecture because of his prior training experience with the United States Marine Corps. According to Li, the lecture was more successful and influenced him more than previous, similar events he has attended.</p>\n<p>“I just thought his advice on getting through pain and suffering was really good … to build resilience,” Li said. “I wasn’t expecting this many people because I went to an event a few weeks ago where a marine was speaking and there was only like ten people.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major Patrick Mossman said he attended the lecture to learn more about the military.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested in joining Army ROTC [Reserve Officers’ Training Corps] here and I just decided to come because I thought it would be interesting hearing from someone, especially a Navy SEAL,” Mossman said. “He had a lot of interesting things to say. I definitely learned some things.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Codie Franklin said hearing Greitens speak was as an impactful learning experience.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have any connections to the military. No family members, no personal experience,” Franklin said. “But I think the ideas he shared here tonight are relevant to me, too. I liked his ideas of growing from what we have experienced. He said something like, ‘What happens to us becomes a part of us’ and that really resonated with me.”</p>\n<p>According to Franklin, Greiten’s idea of “segmenting,” or breaking work assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks, was helpful.</p>\n<p>“That’s helpful in everyday life,” Franklin said. “As students, and a lot of us with jobs, we have busy lives that can seem overwhelming. So I’ll be using this segmenting advice in my life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/","id":2841,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2840,2839,2838],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Students Travel to Ferguson for Alternative Spring Break","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Community Affairs Board (CAB), an official board of the Associated Students Legislative Council comprised of students who do community service events, went on a trip to Ferguson, Missouri, during spri...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Community Affairs Board (CAB), an official board of the Associated Students Legislative Council comprised of students who do community service events, went on a trip to Ferguson, Missouri, during spring break to conduct community service in the city. </p>\n<p>During their trip to Missouri, students conducted street clean-up and personally spoke to members of the local community about police brutality, institutional racism and how the municipal court system in St. Louis county allegedly has a strong policing for profit undertone. CAB’s visit was prompted by the wake of violent protests sparked by the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August of last year.  </p>\n<p>Third-year political science and philosophy double major major and Alternative Breaks co-coordinator coordinator Jeremiah Copeland said the event was entirely different from other CAB events he has attended due to its social justice focus and level of personal engagement with local community members. </p>\n<p>“I thought that the trip was very powerful and a great experience,” Copeland said. “The social justice aspect of the trip was something completely different than CAB has ever really done before, so it was a refreshing experience.” </p>\n<p>Copeland said he has been on other alternative spring breaks, but this trip was more focused on social justice work and remolding systems of power for positive change. </p>\n<p>“I have been on an alternative break to Colorado for flood relief and Oakland to work with foster youth and at food banks,” Copeland said. “Those were more volunteer oriented, and this Ferguson trip was more learning about the multitude of issues that are affecting the area and what we can do to help.” </p>\n<p>Copeland also said the alleged presence of racism in law enforcement in the nation is an issue that must be dealt with on a local and federal level. </p>\n<p>“I think that the Michael Brown case has brought to bright light the racism that is present in many police departments across the nation. It must be stopped,” Copeland said. </p>\n<p>CAB member and first-year Xuewen Sherry Li said the said the situation in Ferguson was upsetting but sparked a vital impetus change in the nation.  </p>\n<p>“It’s sad that this many lives had to end before the silence was broken, but I think awareness and solidarity has brought people from all across the country together,” Li said. </p>\n<p>According to Li, the trip was an impactful experience for her and for all Gaucho participants. </p>\n<p>“It was absolutely amazing, this trip has made me realize that I don’t have to get on a plane to make an impact,” Li said. “All around me are breaches that can be fixed and voices to fight for.”<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62096\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62096\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/62096/","id":2842,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2841,2840,2839],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Arbor Mural Assembled","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Students for Justice in Palestine erect mobile mural, sparking West Bank, Gaza Strip debate","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>Students for Justice in Palestine erect mobile mural, sparking West Bank, Gaza Strip debate</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_62221\" style=\"width: 668px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62221\" data-attachment-id=\"62221\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/new-arbor-mural-assembled/the-wall_lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428481197\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Wall_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C365&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62221\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-Wall_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=658%2C400\" alt=\"Originally assembled at UCI in 2012, the mural has been transferred to and displayed on college campuses as far as UC Berkeley and Arizona State University.

The wall seeks to encourage discussion on the Palestine/Israel conflict, though some students have expressed concerns it does not represent multiple viewpoints.<em> Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) constructed a mural wall in the Arbor on Monday to remain until tomorrow that displays artwork and messages illustrating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the West Bank and Gaza Strip region.</p>\n<p>The wall was originally constructed by SJP at UC Irvine in 2012 and has since been transferred to multiple university campuses, including UC Berkeley, UC Merced, Stanford, Arizona State University and the Claremont Colleges, to promote a UC resolution to divest from companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Palestine/Israel. The Associated Students External Affairs Committee will consider this campus’s divestment resolution at its 6 p.m. meeting today after tabling the proposal at its meeting last week.</p>\n<p>Second-year music major and SJP member Daniel Moltke said the wall was built in order to spark discussion among the campus community about the ongoing conflict in the West Bank and Gaza as well as to inform interested students on the current divestment resolution.</p>\n<p>“We want them to know there is this divestment campaign happening these weeks and that the vote will hopefully be happening Wednesday,” Moltke said. “Our main objective is to spread awareness and let people know that there’s something we can do about it and something we can do about it right now.”</p>\n<p>Third-year history major and SJP member Aaron Reveles said the wall travels to different campuses each spring quarter or semester in order to educate UC students statewide about the UC’s financial holdings in corporations such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard, which all allegedly profit from Israeli government policies in the Palestine/Israel region.</p>\n<p>“This is a communal wall that travels to different campuses,” Reveles said. “We drove down to the last school it was at, which was Pitzer College in [Pomona], with a U-Haul truck we rented out. A group of us worked hard and put it together.”</p>\n<p>According to Moltke, the UC divestment campaign regarding Palestine/Israel reflects a similar past UC resolution calling on an end to apartheid in South Africa.</p>\n<p>“There’s people that were big in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, who mentioned specifically the UC’s divesting was a significant part in the turnaround of their movement,” Moltke said. “So we hope that by getting all of the UC’s on the same page, we can get the regents to stop funding these corporations that perpetuate violence and oppression.”</p>\n<p>However, first-year economics major Jack Tannenbaum said while he believes the wall facilitates political discussion, its messages do not represent multiple perspectives.</p>\n<p>“I’m so happy I’m on a campus like UCSB that facilitates free speech,” Tannenbaum said. “I think that it’s great this wall is up and that it’s starting political discourse. But I really wish … that there had been some form of collaboration, or this wall had shown two sides of the story … I believe it really, really does not.”</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum also said the campaigns associated with the wall represent an “affront” to Jewish self-determination.</p>\n<p>“On this board it says Zionism equals racism … the general definition of Zionism is the belief in having a nation for the Jewish people free from persecution with the right of self-determination,” Tannenbaum said. “Saying that idea is racism — the existence of a Jewish state is racism — personally affronts my belief in the idea that I can have a place as a Jew where I am free from persecution.”</p>\n<p>According to Moltke, despite the presence of the wall, Palestinian students often feel victimized and afraid to voice their opinions at public forums due to potentially consequential future circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There are Palestinians who are afraid to speak at these public meetings because someone pro-Israel can record them and send it to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],” Moltke said.</p>\n<p>Moltke said SJP student groups across the UC feel compelled to display the wall and spark discussion among students because of the challenges Palestinians face expressing free speech abroad.</p>\n<p>“The Israeli government won’t let you into Palestine if you’re pro-divestment or anti-Israel. There are no airports in Palestine so you have to go through Israel and if students speak out,” Moltke said, “they may never get to see their families in Palestine. So it’s up to us to get the word out.”</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Hannah Ellenhorn however said she does not agree with the wall and its illustrations supporting divestment, and believes that the resolution to divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in the Palestine/Israel area is anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>“At the core of the conflict is a refusal for Arab populations to recognize the right of Jewish self-determination in Judea and Samaria,” Ellenhorn said. “The recent move for college campuses to boycott Jewish-owned businesses based in Israel is nothing more than blatant Jew-hatred masked in a degenerate view of social justice.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year computer engineering major Nader Khalil, however, United States’ corporations should cut funding to companies profiting from human rights violations everywhere in the world, no matter who the perpetrators or victims are.</p>\n<p>“Human rights on all scales are important,” Khalil said. “I see the West Bank Settlements as an issue. There is hate from both sides. A practical solution would be to cut American funding of these Israeli settlements and other war crimes that were committed on Gaza. Have a fair trial for the crimes that happen and move from there.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: a previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Tannenbaum stating “Zionism equals racism…the belief in having a nation for the Jewish people.” Tannenbaum actually defined Zionism as the belief in a nation for the Jewish people.
