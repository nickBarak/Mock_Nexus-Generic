Santa Barbara could not shake off its trouble on the road, finishing the season 4-10 away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>After starting the season 3-9 in conference, the Gauchos posted a near-perfect record in March, including a seven-game winning streak to propel them into the seventh seed of the playoffs. However, Santa Barbara had a disappointing conclusion to its season and ended up losing four of its last five games.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UC Irvine continues its run as the hottest team in the nation, extending its winning streak to six games. At 23-6 overall and 19-6 MPSF, the Anteaters seemed poised to reclaim the national title as they advance to the league semifinals against the third-seed Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB still has an outside chance of reaching the Final Four by earning the only at-large bid available, but their first round exit and overall record makes that possibility highly unlikely.</p>\n<p>A back-and-forth first set ended up going to UC Irvine who had to fend off a resilient Gaucho attack to win the frame 26-24. UCSB responded as best they have the entire season, winning the second (25-22) and third set (25-20) to take a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite the lead, Irvine won the fourth set decisively 25-19 and built a five-point lead in fifth set, ultimately winning the final frame 15-10 and eliminating UCSB from the postseason.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht once again led the Gauchos in kills with 19, but Irvine was able to contain his offensive efficiency and limited Licht to a .205 hitting percentage. Licht added 10 digs and four blocks on defense.</p>\n<p>In his final game wearing the UCSB uniform, senior middle blocker Dylan Davis finished off his impressive career by recording six kills and four blocks. His 441 total blocks ranks third overall in program history.</p>\n<p>Irvine advances to the next round primarily on the play of junior outside hitter Kevin Tillie. Tillie delivered on both ends of the court, finishing with 15 kills and seven digs. His three kills in the final set proved to be the difference as he delivered the final point of the match to send the Gauchos back home.</p>\n<p>The middle blocker tandem of juniors Scott Kevorken and Collin Mehring was effective in containing the Gaucho offense and held UCSB to a .213 hitting percentage for the game, compared to a .285 clip for the Anteaters. Kevorken and Mehring combined for 12 kills and 11 total blocks in the game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will have to fill the huge void left by Davis and its three other seniors, including outside hitter Miles Evans, but the remaining players can rely on the experience and chemistry established this year going forward.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50974\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50974\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/","id":5307,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5306,5305,5304],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Adds Three Freshmen to the Roster","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With new Head Coach Nicole Latagne Welch at the helm, the UCSB women’s volleyball team is set to begin a new era.

Former Head Coach Kathy Gregory led her team in her final year to a 16-17 season and finished tied for fifth place with Cal State Fullerton with a 9-9 Big West Conference record.</p>\n<p>“I left with some really good recruits and they have a chance to make an impact for the next year,” Gregory said. “They are freshmen and there is a lot of pressure put on freshmen to have to start and I think the biggest thing will be that hopefully the chemistry of the team will be good with the freshmen in there.”</p>\n<p>Before announcing her retirement, Gregory brought on board three recruits who have a chance of making a real impact next season. Future freshmen Kristen Berlo, Phoebe Grunt and Ali Spindt will all be given a real chance to see some significant playing time next season.</p>\n<p>“These three, Berlo, Spindt and Grunt, are all going to have a good shot at competing for playing time as freshmen,” Latagne Welch said. “Grunt’s a middle and will compete for a spot there, Spindt is an outside right side six-rotation type player and Berlo is a sort of middle outside.”</p>\n<p>Berlo does not have to travel far to become a UCSB student. The Santa Barbara native is a 6’1” middle blocker who played at San Marcos High School and Santa Barbara Volleyball Club. A two-sport athlete, Berlo is expected to play both softball and volleyball at UCSB next year. She is expected to compete for spots around the front row and could see some time on the outside as well.</p>\n<p>In volleyball last season, Berlo played for a 20-12 San Marcos team in 41 of her team’s sets and managed a .492 hitting percentage. She posted 160 kills with 32 blocks and 29 digs in her final year.</p>\n<p>“Berlo is going to play both softball and volleyball,” Gregory said. “She has had some medical issues that will be the determining factor if she can play both sports, but it will be interesting to see how she develops playing both sports.”</p>\n<p>Spindt hails from Menlo Park, California and plays for both Menlo Atherton High School and Encore Volleyball club. The 6’1” outside hitter is expected to play somewhere on the outside, perhaps from day one. Her talents have earned her San Mateo County Player of the Year as well as a nomination for Under Armor Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>Spindt played in 52 sets last season and recorded 127 kills with 217 digs as she helped her team to a 28-8 record and a perfect 14-0 in league play.</p>\n<p>“They have a chance to completely start Ali Spindt,” Gregory said. “The right side is probably the most physical and I think she has a really good chance to play on the right side and compete. She could on the left too she is one of the top recruits.”</p>\n<p>Grunt comes to the Gauchos from Alameda, California where she played for St. Joseph’s Notre Dame High School. She is also a member of Encore Volleyball club.</p>\n<p>“Their club teams are doing really well and that shows they are getting to play at that high club level,” Latagne Welch said. “Right now that will get them ready for college and get ready for that adjustment.”</p>\n<p>Grunt is a 6’4” middle blocker whose height will surely make a welcome addition to the front line of the Gauchos. Grunt was named MVP of her high school team for three straight years and was labeled a “Star Athlete” by Bay Area News Group.</p>\n<p>In her senior year, Grunt helped lead her team to a 27-12 record with a .479 hitting percentage, 414 kills and 137 blocks in her 105 sets played. Grunt also posted an impressive 89 serving aces.</p>\n<p>“I really like our ’13 class,” Latagne Welch said. “They are great athletes, great volleyball players and just great people.

After being picked No. 4 in the preseason coaches’ poll, the Gauchos ended up finishing tied for fifth in the Big West with a conference record of 9-9 and an overall 16-17 record.<br>\nLuckily for UCSB, this will be a completely new season with a very different looking team.<br>\nThis year marks a new beginning for UCSB volleyball as for the first time in 38 seasons Kathy Gregory will not be the team’s head coach. The legendary Gaucho coach, who holds the school record for winning percentage (.681) and won the AVCA National Coach of the Year award in 1993, retired after last season.<br>\nTaking Gregory’s place at the helm is Nicole Lantagne Welch, who is coming off a 25-6 season and a trip to the NCAA tournament at the University of Miami last season. During her time at Miami, Welch compiled a 243-120 record, giving her an impressive .669 winning percentage.<br>\nThe Gauchos come into this season as the No. 6 team in the Big West, as voted by the coaches. The biggest roster change for them will be in the middle, as standout libero Taylor Formico will not be returning to the team.<br>\nAs a freshman last season, Formico broke the school record for digs on her way to being named the Big West Freshman of the Year and earning a First Team All-Big West selection.<br>\nUCSB’s only other departure in the offseason was another libero in graduated senior Erica Lau. Filling in at the defensive specialist position will be sophomore Shauna Klein, backed by a couple of newcomers in freshmen Ella Roberts and Helen Gannon.<br>\nUCSB is looking strong on the wings with opposite Katey Thompson and outside hitters Leah Sully and Kara Sherrard all entering their senior years. Sully and Thompson were named to the First and Second Team Honorable Mention All-Big West last season, respectively. Despite having only three seniors on the team, the Gauchos will have plenty of solid veteran leadership.<br>\nThe remaining four incoming freshmen include outside hitter Ali Spindt and middle blockers Phoebe Grunt, Allie Sullberg and Kristen Berlo. Berlo, a double athlete who is also on the UCSB softball team, should be an exciting prospect to watch next season as she and the other freshmen compete for playing time.<br>\nAt setter, the Gauchos will welcome the return of junior Ali Santi, who led the team with 8.28 assists per game in 2012. Sophomores Jaylen Villanueva and Hanna Nielson will back Santi up as the only other setters on the team.<br>\nRounding out the roster are two liberos in Klein and junior Keely Stevenson, and three middle blockers in sophomores Britton Taylor and Elizabeth “ZZ” Meddaugh and junior Jordan Pehanick.<br>\nUCSB may have been predicted to finish in the bottom half of the Big West this year, but with a number of fresh new faces on the team and a strong core of upperclassmen, the team could very well make some noise in the conference.<br>\nThe Gauchos open their season this Friday against volleyball powerhouse Stanford. The game will be played at noon at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51814\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-ready-for-season-under-new-head-coach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51814\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-ready-for-season-under-new-head-coach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-ready-for-season-under-new-head-coach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-ready-for-season-under-new-head-coach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-ready-for-season-under-new-head-coach/","id":5305,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5304,5303,5302],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Big West Play vs. Long Beach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W-Vball-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W-Vball-Magali-Gauthier.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With a new coach and a new system, there have been a lot of firsts for the UCSB women’s volleyball team this season.

Long Beach State has started 7-6, while the Anteaters are sitting comfortably above .500 at 9-5.</p>\n<p>While a 5-7 start is not necessarily a dream for the Gauchos, they are hoping their preseason tune-up games and weekly practices will help them get off to a strong start in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“This entire week has just been focused on game time situations and how to finish big points,” Sherrard said. “That’s something that we were trying to focus on in the preseason tournaments. We know Long Beach pretty well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have had a lot of changes since the end of last season, first with the departure of long-time head coach Kathy Gregory and next with the introduction of six new freshmen to the team.</p>\n<p>Replacing Gregory is new head coach Nicole Lantagne Welch, who is coming off a very successful stint at the University of Miami.</p>\n<p>Besides the drastic change at head coach, there have been big changes all over the roster. Most notable of these changes is the departure of last year’s standout freshman libero Taylor Formico, who broke the school and Big West record for digs.</p>\n<p>“[Formico] did leave a pretty big hole,” Sherrard said. “We realized it was a big change, but we all just came together and figured out a way to get past [losing her].”</p>\n<p>The team also brought in six new freshmen, a couple of which have already made a positive impact on the court. Freshmen middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg lead the team in blocks with 37 and 32, respectively.</p>\n<p>Offensively, freshman outside hitter Ali Spindt has really hit stride early in the season, and is tied for the second most kills on the team with 102.</p>\n<p>“[Spindt] has already made a really big impact,” Sherrard said. “She’s one of our go-to [players] when it comes to kills.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore setter Hanna Nielson, who was the Gauchos’ starting setter last season, has gotten off to a good start with 316 assists after just 12 games.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays Long Beach State in the Thunderdome at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, and UC Irvine at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52049\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52049\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/ucsb-opens-big-west-play-vs-long-beach/","id":5306,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5305,5304,5303],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
