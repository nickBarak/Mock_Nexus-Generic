San Francisco drops to 25-28 on the season. By taking the first two games of the series, however, UCSB breaks the program’s record for best non-conference winning percentage in a year and clinches consecutive 30-win seasons for the first time since 1991-1992.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, sophomore pitcher Greg Mahle had his first start of the season, but was roughed up in 3.1 innings of work. The left-hander gave up five runs on eight hits before getting pulled from the game in favor of sophomore relief pitcher Dillon Tate.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>By the end of four innings, UCSB trailed 5-2 and failed to pull any closer, scoring just two more runs before eventually losing.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss, the result for the Gauchos was a lot different from the previous two games played.</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Austin Pettibone delivered his second consecutive complete-game shutout on Saturday en route to a 6-0 win by UCSB. Pettibone went the distance to improve his record to 4-1 on the year, giving up only five hits, a walk and striking out a season-high 10 batters.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara manufactured two runs in the first inning by way of stolen bases and singles. After senior left fielder Joey Epperson got on board via hit by pitch, he stole second base and scored on a RBI hit by sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic. Nesovic later advanced to scoring position and came home on a base hit by junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>While Pettibone cruised past USF’s lineup, the Gauchos tacked on one more run in the fourth inning to push their lead to 3-0. Junior right fielder Scott Quinlan advanced to third base by stealing two bases after he singled and scored on a RBI groundout by junior second baseman Woody Woodward.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos scored one more run in the sixth on a RBI single by sophomore utility Devon Gradford, and twice again in the eighth to complete the 6-0 route.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had a hot start to the series opener on Friday and never looked back, winning 10-4. In the first inning with runners on the corners, Nesovic came up to bat and singled to score Epperson from third base. An error by USF scored another run for the Gauchos to extend their lead to 2-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB went on to score three more runs in the second inning by converting on its bases loaded opportunity. With a runner on each base, the Gauchos’ first run of the frame came by way of pass ball. Nesovic then followed with a bases clearing double that scored two additional runs. Santa Barbara came out of the inning leading by five runs.</p>\n<p>USF earned a run in the third inning off of sophomore starting pitcher Justin Jacome, but the Dons were unable to produce any big run innings in the game. San Francisco’s biggest inning came in the fifth when it scored two runs, but Jacome kept the Dons’ offense on check. In 7.2 innings of work, Jacome limited USF to just six hits and struck out four on his way to picking up his seventh win on the year, the most on the staff.</p>\n<p>UCSB scored five more times in the game, including a homerun by Quinlan in the fifth inning, his first of the season. Quinlan’s 2-5 performance from the plate was just one of the Gauchos’ many solid hitting performances on the day. Epperson had a perfect game from the batter’s box, hitting 3-3 and walking in his three other plate appearances. Nesovic had three RBI in his four-hit game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara now awaits its final series of the season this weekend against conference opponent, UC Davis.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 19th, 2014th’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/","id":4433,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4432,4431,4430],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Host Matadors for Senior Day","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsUCR-DustinHarris-04252014-01.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsUCR-DustinHarris-04252014-01.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB plays in its final home series of the season against CSUN.

Santa Barbara began the year with its second-best start in program history at 18-3 and ranked as high as No. 10. Since then, however, UCSB has been in a tail-spin, losing four of six conference series.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos reached their low point of the season last weekend when they were swept by first-place UC Irvine in a series critical for Big West positioning. Before Tuesday’s win at Bakersfield, UCSB was held from winning its previous four games, the longest stretch the team had gone without winning this season.</p>\n<p>A big reason for UCSB’s struggles has been a lack of quality innings from its starting pitching. Against the Anteaters, Santa Barbara starting pitching combined to allow 12 runs in 12.1 innings of work, while the bullpen gave up a total of five runs in 10.5 innings of relief.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Gauchos’ relief pitching has been the most consistent facet of this year’s team. Despite giving up a late lead to UCI last weekend in the second game of the series, the bullpen had previously pitched the Gauchos into having a 20-0 record when leading after the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>The duo of sophomore relief pitchers Greg Mahle and Dillon Tate have provided a solid tandem in the back end of the bullpen for UCSB. Besides their reliability, the two have been workhorses for the team. Mahle ranks first in conference appearances by a pitcher with 13 and is coming off his longest outing where he pitched six shutout innings of two-hit ball in the series finale against Irvine.</p>\n<p>Mahle’s standout year has taken a backseat to Tate’s own outstanding season. Tate is second behind Mahle in conference appearances by a pitcher with 11 and after pitching three scoreless innings against Bakersfield, he lowered his ERA to 0.55. The shutdown closer has allowed just one earned run in 21 of his 22 outings this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also need to put more runs on the board against a team that ranks second to last in the conference in ERA at 3.64. Recently, junior shortstop Peter Maris has been the best hitter for the Gauchos. In his last eight games he has hit .362, including collecting three hits and two RBI against CSUB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has done significantly better at home than on the road and will look to take advantage of the Matadors’ troubles away from home.

The Gauchos will have to win their six remaining games to do so.</p>\n<p>Already in desperation mode entering the game, Head Coach Andrew Checketts opted for a pitching change in the first inning after sophomore starting pitcher Domenic Mazza gave up UCSB’s 2-0 lead on a RBI groundout and a homerun.</p>\n<p>Sophomore designated hitter/relief pitcher Greg Mahle came in to stop the bleeding, but not before he ran into trouble in the fourth inning.</p>\n<p>With UCSB down by a run, Mahle allowed the runner on second base to score on a double down the left field line, forcing Checketts to make another pitching change.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine began separating itself from there on despite sophomore closer Dillon Tate taking over on the mound. The right-hander salvaged the inning by allowing only one more batter to cross the plate on a wild pitch. However, Pepperdine extended its lead to 6-2.</p>\n<p>The game got even uglier for the Gauchos after that. After the Waves managed only one run on a bases-loaded situation in the fifth inning, they broke the game completely open in the next three innings.</p>\n<p>Senior relief pitcher Cameron Cuneo took over in the sixth and loaded the bases with one out. Cuneo then walked the next batter before Checketts made another call to the pen.</p>\n<p>The move did not pay off as the next batter also walked with the bases loaded. In total, the Waves earned two runs on only one hit in that inning.</p>\n<p>While UCSB attempted to find the right combination on the mound, the Waves’ sophomore starting pitcher Jackson McClelland was in complete control of his game.</p>\n<p>Through six innings of work, McClelland allowed only two runs on five hits, striking out seven batters and walking only two to improve his record to 7-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put an end to its scoring drought in the top half of the seventh with a three-run inning.</p>\n<p>Sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic had an infield single with the bases loaded and two outs to earn the first run and junior right fielder Cameron Newell hit a two-run single to tack on more runs for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine put a stamp to the game in the bottom half of the inning with a two-run homerun that pushed its run total into the double-digit range. With one more run in the eighth, the Waves finished the game with a total of 12 runs.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did have standout performances from two of its players. Junior shortstop Peter Maris hit 2-5 and Nesovic went 2-4 from the plate and one of three Gauchos to earn at least one RBI in the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays again this weekend against San Francisco in a non-conference series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 14, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55296\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55296\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/","id":4431,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4430,4429,4428],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Beat CSUN in Final Home Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos' playoff hopes in danger after failing to sweep CSUN.

Freshman starting pitcher Shane Bieber managed to escape the inning, but the damage was done for UCSB. The Gauchos manufactured only one run in the sixth inning on a RBI hit by sophomore designated hitter/pitcher Greg Mahle.</p>\n<p>“We weren’t ready to go defensively and then we couldn’t adjust offensively later,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “They weren’t flat. They had energy, but their concentration level probably wasn’t where it needed to be.”</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Austin Pettibone’s complete-game shutout on Saturday clinched the series for the Gauchos as the team won 6-0. The right-hander delivered his best outing of the season, facing only 30 batters and throwing 85 pitches to pick up the win and improve to 3-1 on the year.</p>\n<p>“He had everything working today. He hit all his spots and when he does that he’s pretty unhittable,” senior left fielder Joey Epperson said. “The fastball was coming out of his hand well. He did a good job of being deceptive at times and throwing pitches where he wants in the strike zone.”</p>\n<p>UCSB led 2-0 in the eighth inning before adding four big insurance runs to extend its lead. After junior right fielder Cameron Newell scored from second base on a throwing error, the top half of Santa Barbara’s lineup capitalized on senior relief pitcher Michael Coates’s poor outing on the mound.</p>\n<p>Coates allowed two runs on a RBI triple by Maris and a double by Epperson, which drove Coates out of the game. Sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic capped off the inning with a single to bring Epperson home.<br>\nSanta Barbara previously scored two runs in the fourth inning on a two-run homerun by Epperson. With a runner on second base, Epperson smashed the ball opposite-field for his fourth homer on the year and first since March 16.</p>\n<p>“In that situation, mainly I was just trying put the barrel to the baseball and find a way to get that run in,” Epperson said. “And I wound up taking a good swing on the ball and it left the yard. With Pettibone pitching that was really all we needed.”</p>\n<p>In the first game of the series on Friday, the Gauchos’ four runs in the third inning was just enough, with the final score ending 4-3 in favor of UCSB. Newell singled to get the third inning started for the Gauchos and scored two outs later on a hit to the left side by Maris.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s senior pitcher Brycen Rutherford followed the Maris single by loading the bases, setting the stage for a two-run RBI hit from Nesovic. Freshman center fielder Andrew Calica singled one more time in the inning to give UCSB a 4-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara’s lineup gave UCSB the lead, Mahle’s versatility in the batter’s box and on the mound proved to be the difference in the game. After sophomore starting pitcher Justin Jacome gave up three runs in the sixth inning, Mahle came in relief with the bases loaded and pitched out of the jam to maintain UCSB’s lead.</p>\n<p>Mahle filled the stat sheet on the day. From the plate, Mahle went 2-3 with a walk and a run scored. His two innings pitched in relief secured the lead before sophomore closer Dillon Tate came on in the eighth and ninth inning to close the door on the Matadors.</p>\n<p>UCSB is back in action Tuesday against Pepperdine. The game is of critical importance in terms of UCSB qualifying for the NCAA tournament, given that the Waves are the last opponent the Gauchos will face with an RPI of above 40.
