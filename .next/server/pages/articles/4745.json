The Haven at Santa Barbara would not be a university program, but Gauchos for Recovery and the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program plan to largely endorse the project.</p>\n<p>According to The Haven at College co-founder Holly Sherman, The Haven will open its doors in July and thus far has one student committed to living there. Although The Haven is currently “working on the math,” Sherman said the cost of staying at this sober living house will be roughly higher than living in an on-campus dorm.</p>\n<p>“There is an additional fee for the services we provide,” Sherman said. “It’s a little above the cost of room and board at a dorm.”</p>\n<p>Sherman said students living at The Haven will be treated with peer support programs and clinician care in order to facilitate effective recovery and ensure a healthy environment for residents.</p>\n<p>“We are a supportive group,” Sherman said. “The most practical measure is that it’s run by students — we hire students who are great role models of recovery.”<br>\nThe Haven at College co-founder Sharon Weber said The Haven at Santa Barbara was established through connections made with the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program after working with the UC Office of the President in the fall.</p>\n<p>“We had been in dialogue with the UC system and it was through that exposure that we met some of the people involved in the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program at UCSB,” Weber said. “They were the ones that invited us to come up and engage in some conversations.”</p>\n<p>According to Alcohol &amp; Drug Program director Jackie Kurta, she first heard of The Haven at College when she picked up educational literature about the program at a conference in the fall. Kurta said establishing a sober living facility in I.V. seemed like “good timing,” given the difficult past year and changing attitude of I.V. towards safety and health.</p>\n<p>“It felt to me like this would be a wonderful opportunity for us here in Isla Vista,” Kurta said. “We contacted them and they were very enthusiastic, and they really were very interested in checking out the possibilities here.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said she favors the recovery program administered at The Haven at College because it is specifically catered toward college students seeking to abstain from drug and alcohol use.</p>\n<p>“Their program is just such an excellent one,” Kurta said. “It really takes into consideration the specific needs of students in a college setting, as opposed to another traditional sober living facility which serves a kind of broad spectrum of ages and lifestyles.”</p>\n<p>According to Weber, The Haven at Santa Barbara will act as a supportive body to aid students seeking to refrain from substance abuse rather than as a “policing body.”</p>\n<p>“We don’t have anything against drugs and alcohol; we believe they have their place in the college life,” Weber said. “But if you have a problem with them and they’re kicking your ass, then you’re welcome to come to The Haven at Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>UCLA alumnus Danny Buchan said he has been living at The Haven at USC for two years since seeking recovery from his drug addiction and is now four years clean.</p>\n<p>“If I didn’t do something, I would have died, or much less be able to go to school or live a constructive life, so I went to treatment and I got into recovery,” Buchan said. “Now that I’ve gone into recovery, I can enjoy life at the moment and be more connected to the world and people around me.”</p>\n<p>Buchan said he works as The Haven at USC house manager, where he administers recovery practices such as weekly 12-step programs, frequent breathalyzing, random urine tests and a temporary curfew.</p>\n<p>“There are accountability measures that we have just to assure the safety of The Haven and to make sure that everyone is staying sober and that everyone’s on the right track,” Buchan said.</p><div

A more permanent solution—of wood fences up to four-and-a-half feet tall—will be supported by $70,000 from UCSB, the university announced Tuesday. <em>Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB announced Tuesday that it will provide $70,000 to Santa Barbara County for the construction of permanent fences along the bluffs in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The university said it will cover the entire estimated cost for the installation of the fences and has agreed that if the project comes in under budget, the remaining funds will be used by the county for maintaining the fence. The fences will run from the end of Del Playa Open Space Park to Walter Capps Park and will include all parks owned by the county and the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD). Once the fence is completed, the county will assume responsibility for future maintenance and repairs.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s involvement in the fencing project since the death of multiple students from <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/cliff-fall-victim-paralyzed-from-waist-down/\">cliff falls</a> in 2013 has largely contributed to the university’s decision to provide funding to the county.</p>\n<p>“Chancellor Yang has been deeply involved in this project since the beginning, when Molly Morrison founded Fence Isla Vista, and since we lost students to cliff-related deaths and injuries,” Schunk said. “Yang has taken a very active and involved role in this entire effort so I think part of it was him pushing it and making it a top priority.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biological sciences major and Fence I.V. founder Molly Morrison said she founded her organization, which aims to improve current fencing standards along the cliffs on Del Playa Drive, after her friend and <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/woman-found-on-isla-vista-beach-identified-as-cal-poly-slo-student/\">Cal Poly SLO student Giselle Ayala</a>, along with three other students, died after falling from the cliffs since April 2013.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s extremely vital to make these occurrences as preventable as possible,” Morrison said. “I do believe the personal responsibility is also an extremely vital aspect in these scenarios, but there is work to be done on both ends to help end these tragedies.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said she believes the university decided to fund the project due to Santa Barbara county’s historical lack of funding to improve fencing along the I.V. cliffs.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much that they have been inactive, but that it has taken so long to find a source of funding that should normally be very fast, as fencing is one of the largest safety concerns in Santa Barbara area,” Morrison said. “[UCSB’s contribution] is extremely helpful, as it is funding the entire project. I am so grateful for the generous donors who have dedicated their resources to help make this place safer.”</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD general manager Rodney Gould, the university’s contribution to the project is critical to its timely completion because the project was not a budgeted expense for the district and therefore was difficult to fund. Gould said construction should begin shortly given the end of the permitting process.</p>\n<p>“I know the funding has been received by the County and they are in discussions with a contractor,” Gould said in an email. “My best guess, and it is only a guess, is that construction will begin in the next few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said the fences installed along the bluffs will be three-ring wood fences up to 54 inches high with diamond-shaped, nylon-coated chain links to prevent someone from being able to climb over the fence.</p>\n<p>“The idea for the small diamonds is so you can’t fit your hands or toes into it easily and climb over it,” Schunk said. “The thing to keep in mind is we aren’t going for a high security fence because we’re looking at prevention.”</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said the university and the county have been working on installing I.V. bluff fencing since last Fall and that the recent funding will finally ensure the project’s completion.</p>\n<p>“I asked the chancellor last October in a letter to fund a couple of county projects, starting with the bluff fencing, and the county said that we would do the maintenance once it was installed,” Farr said. “It’s on our agenda for next week so I’m really happy to see that it’s finally coming together.”</p>\n<p>Farr also said the county wants to make open park spaces on DP as safe as possible in light historical cliff falls resulting in the death of multiple students since 2005.</p>\n<p>“We warn people about the danger of the bluffs and although there have always been some kind of a fence up there to deter people, they either obey the signs or go around the fencing and walk on the other side,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, many individuals do not take into account that the cliffs’ eroding nature make their edges particularly dangerous for people treading the Del Playa bluffs.</p>\n<p>“People also need to understand that the geologic material of those bluffs are very erosive so they’re constantly crumbling away. I think that’s another reason why people might make the mistake sometimes and think there’s more property on the other side of the fence than there really is,” Farr said. “So we’re constantly monitoring it from a public safety standpoint from the beach side as well as from the upper side.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said while the university’s contribution is helpful, he hopes it is more than a one-time effort to improve safety in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I hope this influx of funds towards I.V. and level of attention is not temporary because of the events last spring, but history tells us it is,” Abboud said in an email. “I’m optimistic that this time around we can come up with a long term solution that keeps everyone involved and helping better Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Cameron Schunk stating a preference for a high security fence. Schunk actually said the fence were for prevention, not high security purposes.

After a scoreless ninth from both teams, the game was forced into extra innings.</p>\n<p>The game remained scoreless through the top of the 13th when a single by freshman first baseman Kyle Plantier turned into the winning run, hit in by redshirt sophomore Paddy O’Brien to win the game.</p>\n<p>“I’m seeing the ball well right now and going up with a good approach, and trying to have quality at-bats,” O’Brien said. “These games are big right now, and we’re taking it one inning at a time.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore righty Shane Bieber started Sunday’s game and pitched through eight innings, allowing three runs off six hits while striking out six Aggies. Freshman lefty Kyle Nelson entered the game in hopes of a one-inning win, but after four consecutive scoreless innings from the Gaucho lineup, Nelson ended the game with five perfect innings pitched. Nelson faced 15 batters and struck out five for his third win of the season.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to know [Checketts] trusts me to get out of these tough situations that we get ourselves into. It’s always fun to pitch in really close games,” Nelson said. “I try not to make the situation too big mentally. I go one pitch at a time and keep myself calm and composed and really go after people.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gauchos nearly shut out the Aggies in a 4-1 UCSB victory. Junior lefty Justin Jacome got the start and win during Saturday’s game advancing his record to 7-3.<br>\nJacome allowed the single Aggies run off three hits while striking out seven in his eight overall innings pitched. Junior lefty Domenic Mazza took over for the one-inning save in the ninth after facing only three Davis batters.</p>\n<p>“This was a battle. Davis really had a good team, its pitching got tremendously better from last year,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the Gaucho offense put 11 hits on the board for their four runs scored. After this weekend, the Gaucho lineup continues to lead the conference in collective batting average as it hits for .297.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, both redshirt senior outfielder Luke Swenson and sophomore designated hitter Billy Fredrick had one RBI and went 2-3 on the day. Swenson also accounted for one of the runs scored.</p>\n<p>“I’d like us to do a better job with runners in scoring position. Our power numbers aren’t up there so we’re going to have to steal more bases,” Checketts said. “We got 14 hits today, and if you’re going to hit a single, you better be able to steal a base to get into scoring position. We did OK today with it, but I think we could have done it better and put more pressure on them.”</p>\n<p>Junior righty Dillon Tate opened up the series against Davis on Friday in his seventh win of the season. Tate added seven strikeouts to his record and allowed two runs off five hits in his eight innings pitched. Nelson recorded a ninth inning save following Tate.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense put up three runs and 10 hits against Davis’s 6-5 senior righty Spencer Koopmans. Koopmans went for six innings before handing the ball over to the Aggie bullpen. Senior infielder Woody Woodward went two-for-four and recorded a triple in Friday’s game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play their last home midweek game on Tuesday against CSU Bakersfield before going on the road to face tough Big West opponent Cal State Fullerton next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63039\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-04/ucsb-earns-first-big-west-sweep-moves-into-first-place-tie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63039\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-04/ucsb-earns-first-big-west-sweep-moves-into-first-place-tie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-04/ucsb-earns-first-big-west-sweep-moves-into-first-place-tie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-04/ucsb-earns-first-big-west-sweep-moves-into-first-place-tie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-04/ucsb-earns-first-big-west-sweep-moves-into-first-place-tie/","id":4743,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4742,4741,4740],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Adopt-A-Block Holds Isla Vista Clean-up Following Deltopia","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Volunteer organization Adopt-A-Block held an Isla Vista clean-up following a full day of Deltopia festivities on Saturday, drawing over 300 students participants on Sunday.

Many participants were students from various environmental groups, community service organizations and Greek life.</p>\n<p>Adopt-A-Block supervisor Adam Porté said I.V. relies solely on volunteers for clean-up and that without volunteer help, litter would otherwise be left on the streets.</p>\n<p>“Most of the time everywhere else in the world … you’re going to have a private contractor that would come out and clean up all the trash afterwards,” Porté said. “We don’t have that here, so the amount of trash that is generated and is left on the streets from events like this is just essential to have all these volunteers because if we didn’t that stuff would just sit there forever.”</p>\n<p>According to Porté, clean-up events are important because I.V. does not have street sweeping days, and street sweepers are unable to remove trash because of the large number of parked cars.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista we technically don’t have street sweeping days,” Porté said. “All the cars on one side of the street never have to be moved, so a street sweeper can’t get in. So any of the trash you see on the ground never gets picked up except when our volunteers pick it up.”</p>\n<p>Computer engineering major and Lieutenant Governor of Circle K International Club Andrew Pagan said he helped organize and keep track of the logistics of the cleanup.</p>\n<p>“Today we are helping out with registration because we need people to sign waivers and come back to register the number of hours they picked up trash, number of buckets of trash, and blocks they covered,” said Pagan. “Having 300 people in one day in two hours cleans a lot of blocks”</p>\n<p>First-year economics and accounting major Dejanae Allen said collecting trash is important for the safety of Isla Vistans, especially with the large amount of glass littering the streets.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of glass, so we were trying to pick that up because I know some people walk around barefoot so we got to make sure we get that picked up,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>Second-year environmental studies and economics double major Jose Valdez said athough Deltopia this year did not generate as much trash as last year, it is important to clean up litter accumulated to protect the environment.</p>\n<p>“Deltopia was a lot more controlled this year with the huge effort to keep out-of-towners out of here, so people were more controlled so it’s a lot less trash, people were more respectful especially since most of them lived here,” Valdez said. “It’s important to clean the trash up because that trash you see on the sidewalk will end up in the sewers, and that sewer will end up in the water and that’s going to effect the environment.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies major Anbareen Shefa said trash on streets in I.V. could easily end up in the ocean.</p>\n<p>“We’re so close to the ocean when you have heavy winds, the winds just going to blow all the trash into the ocean, so I’m trying to divert that as much as I can,” Shefa said. “There are lots of cigarette butts, which is mostly what I’m after. People smash them into the plants and stuff, it’s sad.”</p>\n<p>Porté said he was content with the number of people that showed up to participate in the cleanup and was glad to take part in the event to improve the I.V. environment.</p>\n<p>“It’s so much fun to come in and see all these people come together to want to clean up their community,” Porté said. “It’s just so rewarding. And I know that I’m helping out the community and know I’m improving the quality of life for 23,000 people. I’m huge on environmentalism, because that ocean out there it can’t protect itself, so we got to do something about it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62021\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62021\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/adopt-a-block-holds-isla-vista-clean-up-following-deltopia/","id":4744,"author":{"id":163,"name":"Shelly Lu"},"related":[4743,4742,4741],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
