Nakamura is receiving this award for his invention of the blue light-emitting diode, or LED, together with Japanese colleagues Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said the university takes pride in Nakamura’s technological innovation and the consequent positive impact he has had on the world.</p>\n<p>“The Order of Culture award is a significant acknowledgement that Professor Nakamura’s invention of the first bright blue light-emitting diode will continue to be recognized the world over for its long-lasting and far-reaching impacts on our global society,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, in addition to Nakamura’s “unparalleled breakthroughs” in physics, materials science and technology, his invention of the LED has led to affordable energy access for citizens across the globe.</p>\n<p>“By making white LED lighting a reality, he has opened the door to affordable, energy-efficient lighting for every person in every nation– a monumental contribution to all of humankind,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Watch the <em>Daily Nexus</em>‘ interview with Professor Nakamura <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-14/nobel-prize-winner-and-ucsb-professor-shuji-nakamura-interview/\">here.</a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57470\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/japanese-emperor-to-award-ucsb-nobel-laureate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57470\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/japanese-emperor-to-award-ucsb-nobel-laureate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/japanese-emperor-to-award-ucsb-nobel-laureate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/japanese-emperor-to-award-ucsb-nobel-laureate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/japanese-emperor-to-award-ucsb-nobel-laureate/","id":2988,"author":{"id":178,"name":"Jackson Kerr"},"related":[2987,2986,2985],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":178,"name":"Jackson Kerr","biography":"Not available","articles":[2988,3375,4806],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Schunk’s platform focuses on I.V. self-<br> governance and student advocacy through community members, business owners and long-term residents. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Associated Students held a forum at the Arbor on Wednesday for the position of A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, a fourth-year psychology and political science double major, is running unopposed to fill the void previously left by fourth-year sociology and Asian American studies major Beatrice Contreras. The forum was held yesterday afternoon in the Arbor to inform students about Schunk’s platform and goals for the future if elected.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology and Chicano Studies double-major Gerardo Gonzalez, a general member of the elections committee, said no one outside of A.S. asked questions.</p>\n<p>“Questions were centered around his position as a EVPLA, what he was working to accomplish, his thoughts and his experience he’s had with Associated Students and the EVPLA office in Isla Vista,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>According to Cameron, his platform focuses primarily on providing student advocacy and self-governance for the residents of I.V., and there is no one entity responsible for everyone living in I.V.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day we are represented by one of five supervisors on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors,” Schunk said. “Of that one person, we’re only 20 percent of her voter block. We’re not her priority and that’s not because she’s a bad person, it’s because she doesn’t have the resources to dedicate to us effectively. If we have the resources ourselves, we would be able to do it just fine.“</p>\n<p>A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Molly Morrison said Schunk’s platform resonated with her and that he demonstrated concern for the future of I.V., a concern she found lacking in many other students.</p>\n<p>“Most students here, because they are so transient, don’t seem to care about the future of UCSB, SBCC students and Isla Vista long-term residents,” Morrison said. “I think his platform for self-governance and overall for culture improvement really speaks to me. If we don’t have anyone to speak for us right now, then who will speak for us in the future?”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, another primary goal of his is to create an “I Support Isla Vista” campaign for community members, business owners, and long-term residents to catalyze advocacy and community interest in I.V.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I’ve noticed in Isla Vista is whenever I attend a county board meeting, it is largely long-term residents that are there. It is because students aren’t aware that those things are happening,” Schunk said. “If we don’t speak, no one will hear us.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he also hopes to have A.S., and eventually the university, provide outreach by providing bilingual publications and announcements.</p>\n<p>“I want A.S. and especially the entire student body to take accountability for the impacts we make on the Isla Vista community,” Schunk said. “Just because you love something, doesn’t mean you always take care of it, even when it needs to be taken care of.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, October 30, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57650\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57650\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/","id":2985,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2984,2983,2982],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students, Companies Connect at Fall Career Fair","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Career Services held the first day of its Fall Career Fair yesterday at Corwin Pavilion, with a second day open only to science, technology and engineering students, open today.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57287\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57287\" data-attachment-id=\"57287\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/career-fair_will-tran_for-10-22-2812-2812/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Career-Fair_Will-Tran_for-10.22.2812-2812.jpg?fit=1600%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1007\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1413977960\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Career Fair_Will Tran_for 10.22.2812-2812\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Career-Fair_Will-Tran_for-10.22.2812-2812.jpg?fit=250%2C157&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Career-Fair_Will-Tran_for-10.22.2812-2812.jpg?fit=888%2C558&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57287\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Career-Fair_Will-Tran_for-10.22.2812-2812-1024x644.jpg?resize=500%2C315\" alt=\"UCSB students and potential employers alike dressed to impress at Wednesday’s Career Fair.

Although the event is free for all students, alumni are welcome with a nominal fee paid two days in advance.</p>\n<p>According to Career Services counselor Molly Steen, the fair usually attracts a turnout of about 600 to 800 students.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good number of students that come through and take advantage of this,” Steen said.</p>\n<p>Annie Phung, a fourth-year communication major and member of business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi, one of the fair sponsors, said her organization has been busy trying to promote the event by passing out flyers, posters and making announcements. She said the fair is a good opportunity not only to come into contact with potential employers, but to gain employment-seeking skills.</p>\n<p>“You just come and talk to people,” Phung said. “It is also good practice for them to look professional; to communicate on a casual, yet professional level with employers face-to-face.”</p>\n<p>Carolina Feria, a fourth-year sociology and Spanish double major and member of Teach for America, said she is excited be on the other side of job hunt, helping students get career experience.</p>\n<p>“There is so much potential in all these students, and the fact that I was on the other side last year and I’m helping them now is so amazing,” Feria said. “You can tell the difference between somebody who takes the initiative to bring a resume, somebody who takes the initiative to have everything clean and somebody who takes the initiative to really stand out is really great.”</p>\n<p>Alumna Kristie Reynolds, who represented Macy’s, said there are certain steps students can do to improve their chances of landing a job.</p>\n<p>“Be prepared,” Reynolds said. “Definitely look up all the companies that are going to be at the career fair that you’re interested in. I think you need to know what positions that they have available … and know what you want to go into and be prepared with the experience that you have and how to sell yourself at the career fair.”</p>\n<p>Electrical engineering major Daren Jing said he focused on writing a good resume to get an internship for electrical or computer engineering. He said the career fair makes the job search easily accessible for all students.</p>\n<p>“This [is] good because I can talk to those people, those employees and learn more about their company,” Jing said. “I don’t need to go online and search [for] each company. It takes a lot of time, but here, I can talk to each [person] and hand out my resume.”</p>\n<p>Reynolds said students will learn about the career options they’ll have during and after college.</p>\n<p>“I hope that they’ll get good experience in learning how to network and find out what’s out there for them and how UCSB can really help them develop their careers after college,” she said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 14 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Lectures</h4>\n<p>Michael Lewis, acclaimed author of <em>Moneyball, The Blind Side</em> and <em>Flash Boys,</em> came to the Granada Theatre Tuesday night to speak about his experience as a financial journalist, storyteller and self-proclaimed sloth.</p>\n<p>Hosted by Arts &amp; Lectures, NPR business reporter Sonari Glinton moderated the evening, beginning with an interview portion and allowing time at the end for an audience question and answer session.</p>\n<p>Lewis said he graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Art History and went on to the London School of Economics to graduate with a degree in Economics.</p>\n<p>“I was very, very lucky in that before I entered University, my father told me to find and study what I loved,” Lewis said. “In exchange he would give me a three-year buffer after I left school in which he would pay for my living expenses and education.”</p>\n<p>According to Lewis, the offer from his father was instrumental for his career.</p>\n<p>“It was during this time that I discovered I wanted to be a writer, and shortly after that I discovered I had to do something to make up for my Art History degree,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>Lewis included anecdotes from his childhood in Louisiana, describing the environment of New Orleans by quoting the family motto his father once told him.</p>\n<p>“Do as little as possible, for it is better to receive a slight reprimand than perform an arduous task,” Lewis said. “A very large part of my life is dedicated to avoiding unpleasant chores.”</p>\n<p>Lewis went on to discuss the process that is involved in finding a story and putting it on paper and how the story of <em>The Blind Side</em> came to be, beginning with how he discovered it.</p>\n<p>“I went to visit a friend of mine from high school in Memphis one year,” Lewis said. “When I got to his house, there was a six-foot-tall, 350-pound black kid sitting in the living room of a white Republican Evangelical Christian in the most segregated city in America … and no one said anything about it.”</p>\n<p>Lewis continued to describe how the story progressed over the year and how he came to terms with writing a story that eventually turned into a movie about his best friend’s family, as well as his experience working as a writer in Hollywood.</p>\n<p>“It was great! Movie people are great, they fear the writer,” Lewis said. “They would solicit my opinion and then completely ignore what I said, they just wanted to make sure I would stay nice. But both ‘Moneyball’ and ‘Blindside’ turned out to be truly good films.”</p>\n<p>Lewis also said it is a highly impersonal process to have a personal work turned into a Hollywood hit.</p>\n<p>“The stupidity in Hollywood is not at the level of actors, writers and directors,” Lewis said. “There’s some truly beautiful storytelling that happens there. The stupidity in Hollywood lies in the business decisions.”</p>\n<p>Lewis concluded the discussion by answering audience questions and touching on what it means to be a good writer.</p>\n<p>“People who are really good storytellers tend to have very distinctive voices on the page, people are afraid of their individuality and once they start mimicking their favorite writers, their value is gone,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>According to Lewis, his future plans include writing a book about U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>“He has really let me into his life like no other journalist, and if I’m able to write this book the way I want, six months after the end of his presidency people will want nothing more than to read a book about Obama,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>Glinton said she enjoyed meeting Lewis, whom he admires for his rare talent.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of those weird things when you’re meeting someone who you’ve known and followed and then you meet them and realize you don’t have to be scared about it,” Glinton said. “He’s a natural storyteller, and genuine, real, accomplished storytellers are few and far between. He’s one of the masters right now.”</p>\n<p>Glinton also said he thought Lewis’ advice would be of practical use to students.</p>\n<p>“Something he said to the student about doing what you like really stuck with me also, it’s ridiculous to tell someone to follow their dreams,” Glinton said. “But students should really be in pursuit of what they like to do.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major and Arts &amp; Lectures student manager for the event Lauren Cassis agreed and said she enjoyed his discussion about his books and his time as an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>“I thought he was very insightful and I liked how his conversation was very broad in the topics,” Cassis said. “Hearing about ‘The Blind Side,’ how the story came together, was very interesting.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An earlier version of this article used the pronoun “she” when referencing to Sonari Glinton, when in actuality the article should have used “he”.]</em></p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57284\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/michael-lewis-discusses-past-future-projects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57284\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/michael-lewis-discusses-past-future-projects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/michael-lewis-discusses-past-future-projects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/michael-lewis-discusses-past-future-projects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/michael-lewis-discusses-past-future-projects/","id":2987,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2986,2985,2984],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
