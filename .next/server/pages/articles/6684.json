","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gorillaz, the critically acclaimed virtual rock band and brainchild of musician Damon Albarn and comic artist Jamie Hewlett, released their fifth studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humanz</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The band consists of virtual members 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle and Russel Hobbs. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humanz </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the first Gorillaz album released since 2010, and it seemed to be on the right track with five solid promotional singles. However, the full project generally failed to live up the high expectations that long-time fans have for Gorillaz.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 20-song album (26 if you get the deluxe version) certainly delivers a high quantity of tracks that Gorillaz fans have been desperate for over the past few years, but at times, it feels bloated and disjointed as an album. It starts with a magnificent intro that sets up the themes of post-apocalyptic technology, which permeates the album and smoothly transitions to perhaps the most exciting song on the album, “Ascension.” Featuring stellar verses by Vince Staples over a manic beat, this starts the album with a punch to the face in the best way possible. However, the next track, “Strobelite,” leaves much to be desired. While the song itself isn’t bad, it sounds like an incredibly generic house track featuring singer Peven Everett. There is almost no trace of Gorillaz in this song, and this is only the second real song of the album. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, “Strobelite” is indicative of the album as a whole, as many of the songs feel like frontman Albarn’s excuse to produce tracks for his favorite artists. This would be fine if this was one of Albarn’s solo projects, but Gorillaz carries with it an expectation to play into the unique aspect of a virtual band with an interesting cast of characters — a feature sorely lacking on most of the tracks here.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is a plethora of missteps and questionable decisions on this album (don’t even get me started on the bizarre and boring “Hallelujah Money” or SoundCloud quality “Sex Murder Party”), there are also quite a few highlights. “Charger” actually sounds like a true Gorillaz track and has a nasty driving guitar groove that adds a lot of grit to the track. The Grace Jones feature is one of the few features on the album that doesn’t completely dominate the track, as she contributes otherworldly ad-libs that compliment 2-D’s vocals. The middle of the album proves to be the best section and, not coincidently, is the section that feels less overpowering — including the only featureless song on the album, “Busted and Blue.” The melancholy, space-themed ballad brings a moment of genuine emotion in a largely overproduced tracklist and actually brings that fantasy of a virtual band with fictional characters that makes Gorillaz so special. A highlight in the last half of the album is “She’s My Collar,” with the stunning vocals of Kali Uchis brings energy and steadies the album a bit after the rocky “Sex Murder Party.” Other tracks to check out include “Andromeda,” which brings a similar house style as “Strobelite” but maintains the Gorillaz flavor and “We Got the Power,” the catchy, though a bit simple, closer to the album.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humanz  </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">turned out to be an overall disappointment compared to the band’s previous work. It is very hard to come back after seven years and still maintain the consistency that fans have come to expect from Gorillaz throughout their career. However, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humanz </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">definitely has some highlights that recapture the magic that made the band’s previous work so engaging with fans. Fans expect a Gorillaz album to play into the idea of the virtual band, and this album did not have that level of immersion that previous projects did. One can sense the lack of creative impact Hewlett had on the album. Going forward, if they release another album under the Gorillaz moniker, they should play into the unique aspect of the band that fans love. You should give this album a listen, especially the highlight tracks, but don’t expect the grand return of Gorillaz. For that, we just might have to wait some more.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77847\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-12/the-friday-review-humanz-by-gorillaz/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77847\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-12/the-friday-review-humanz-by-gorillaz/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-12/the-friday-review-humanz-by-gorillaz/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-12/the-friday-review-humanz-by-gorillaz/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-12/the-friday-review-humanz-by-gorillaz/","id":6684,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[6683,6682,6681],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes","biography":"Not available","articles":[134,976,1365,5769,6148,6684,6708,6735,6770,6782,6789,6792,6809,6827],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Tchami Takes on Delirium 2017 with Surging Tracks","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Cheers from the audience roared vivaciously as Tchami began bumping his initial beats shortly before 11 p.m. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This Saturday, Oct. 28, Tchami performed at Delirium for an energetic crowd of UCSB students awaiting quick stabs and a ripping bass. Martin Bresso, more distinctively known as Tchami, is a French DJ and has worked in collaboration with many notable musicians, including AlunaGeorge, DJ Snake and Jack Ü.</p>\n<p>A music career birthed only four years ago has sprouted into a genre of its own, commonly known as future house music. House music aficionado and philosophy major Jessica O’Brien has an apprehensive outlook on future house:</p>\n<p>“Although some future house songs, especially Tchami’s ‘Shot Caller’ are enjoyable to dance to, the genre doesn’t seem to do much for a deep-house frequenter,” she commented. “The bubblegummy lyrics and quick transition from build-up to drop defeats what’s most interesting about a house song. In my opinion, future house, while being fun, simply feeds the listener shallow lyrics and exciting drops as opposed to creating an entirely consuming house experience.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Future house is an electronic dance music (EDM) genre that incorporates a fusion of EDM and deep house music. In an interview with “THUMP,” Tchami stated that “house music in general is full of mature-minded artists who understand the culture,” and he counts on them to take the genre to the next level with him.</p>\n<p>Delirium originated three years ago as a university-hosted event to evade unruly Halloweekend crowds, around the pickup of Tchami’s music career. Some freshmen were taken aback by the severity of enforcements this Halloweekend. First-year communication major Neela Nassiri was incredibly “disappointed that nothing would be going on Halloween weekend” but was “satisfied because [she had] something to do.” She reports that her friend saw Tchami at Hard Summer 2017 and came back with “raving” reviews, which raised her excitement level for the artist. Though Nassiri has never been to an EDM concert before, she is excited to see her favorite Tchami song, “After Life,” live and be in an environment full of UCSB students.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79571\" style=\"width: 1044px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1398504913\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79570\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79571\" data-attachment-id=\"79571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-08/tchami-takes-on-delirium-2017-with-surging-tracks/unnamed-1-16/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=1034%2C813&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1034,813\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=250%2C197&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=888%2C698&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79571\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=888%2C698\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"698\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?w=1034&amp;ssl=1 1034w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=250%2C197&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=768%2C604&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C805&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79571\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>At 8:45 p.m., the Thunderdome had renovated itself into a laser light show, brimming with color and the sweet sounding trap music of recent UCSB alumnus Underbelly’s set. By 9:20, a big crowd had already formed as students danced rambunctiously to the pre-recorded music. The moshing had already set its course long before Tchami appeared.</p>\n<p>Not too long after 9:30, Morpei, donning a blinding white T-shirt, arrived on stage and immediately amplified the bass. Along with a crowd of students and friends, I formed beat-matching mosh pit after mosh pit, expanding at the build-up and growing at every drop. After a few successfully energetic songs, the DJ ended his set, leaving the crowd sweaty but nonetheless eager for Tchami.</p>\n<p>Cheers from the audience roared vivaciously as Tchami began bumping his initial beats shortly before 11 p.m. A pulsating blue light rhythmically flashed behind the DJ, navigating its way through the depths of the crowd. At this point, everyone was reveling in the sensational sound and the moshing was well underway. I suffered from a few jabs to the jaw as well as soft punches to the head in the rowdy mosh, but it was nothing I couldn’t shake right off to continue dancing.</p>\n<p>Long-time Tchami fan and biology major Ivan Gonzalez most thoroughly enjoyed the song “Afterlife”; he said that was “one of the first songs [he’d] heard” from Tchami and that hearing that song again reminded him of the same performance at Hard Summer, two years back.</p>\n<p>The crowd reacted positively at the turn of each song, indicating familiarity and appreciation for the artist. Even concert-goers at the far end of the stage were rejoicing in the music and dancing just as hard, if not harder, than those in the front. The energy soared consistently throughout the event. Tchami ended his performance with his most popular song, “Adieu,” which incited immense bliss from the crowd.</p>\n<p>To some, Tchami may seem like a run-of-the-mill EDM DJ, but to second-year film studies major Sydney Henrikson, Tchami holds deep sentimental value. She was “so stoked” to see Tchami live, since she has been listening to his music for over a year. In fact, as unbelievable of a combination as it sounds, she danced to Tchami on her first date with her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>Tchami’s sentiment does not end there. Candace McKeag, a second-year statistics major, said that Tchami is by far her favorite EDM artist. She has been listening to Tchami since 2013, when his first EP came out, and even met her boyfriend at a Tchami concert. “Turn Down for What,” a song that Tchami co-wrote with DJ Snake, ranks among one of Candace’s favorites. Candace hopes her boyfriend will propose to her at an upcoming Tchami event.</p>\n<p>At the event, I also spoke with second-year geology major Thomas Crimmel, who said that he was “most excited to dance with everyone around [him].” Crimmel had a sagacious insight on the entirety of the event: “An entire university and a single artist under a single roof is really something special.” If Thomas could sum up his excitement for Tchami in one phrase, he would simply scream “Tchami!” As I looked at the crowd at Delirium, I noticed that what Thomas said reigned true — smiles from a majority of the students beamed graciously in appreciation of EDM music.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.

The sold-out music festival, hosted by comedian Felipe Esparza, attracted a beautifully colorful young and old crowd due to its generationally transcending all-star lineup. The festival featured legendary norteño band Los Tigres del Norte, passionate Latina songstress Kali Uchis, deep and powerful English singer King Krule, indie psychedelic soul rockers Chicano Batman and 30 other diverse performers. The musical acts, along with the assortment of Mexican cuisine, created a festival culture that resonated among the evolving Latinx culture of Southern California.</p>\n</div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To avoid traffic issues, shuttles were arranged to pick up festival goers at the Long Beach Convention Center parking lot and shuttle them to Long Beach Port. Even upon arriving early, there was already a line of eager taco enthusiasts at the gates hoping to cash in on the free taco samples that lasted until four.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Four stages throughout the festival grounds offered a wide range of musical performances. Entering the festival, attendees were greeted by the modest Modelo Stage, which provided a platform for smaller artists, such as the Beach Bums and Jessie Reyes, to perform. It also hosted older performers, like Banda Skalavera and Wanda Jackson, who would be familiar to oldies music lovers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The main stage, Tropicalia, overlooked San Pedro Bay and the Long Beach waterfront, creating a very picturesque atmosphere. Large L.E.D. screens allowed audiences to enjoy views of the band and visuals while standing in the front or sitting on Mexican blankets in the back.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The time approached when our Corona-soaked stomachs began to crave the salty and savory flavors of tacos. A graffiti-covered concrete tunnel bridged the main stage area to the food vendors and the other two stages. Over 20 local vendors boasted a multitude of taco types, from classic birria and vegan to even bánh mì renditions. In addition to tacos, there were other choices such as pozole verde and carnitas taquitos that did not disappoint. The long lines limited the advertised freedom of all-you-can-eat, but people still waited ridiculous amounts of time because, in the end, the tacos were well worth it. The hypnotically smooth sound of Yellow Days could be heard and seen on the Dia De Los Puercos Stage from the taco line.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tropicalia featured performances that reminded the Latinx audience of family barbeques and birthdays in the park. Celso Pino and Sonora Dinamata, musical staples in the cumbia world, entertained the younger crowd with nostalgia while attracting older audiences to revel in their presence. Cuco, 18-year-old singer from L.A., captured the hearts of the young and old crowd with his modern take on Spanish love songs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tropicalia also highlighted many indie bands, including Slow Hollows, Inner Wave and Bane’s World, who recently performed at the KCSB Courtyard, on the intimate Mota Stage. Performing at their first festival, Inner Wave experimented with funky synth sounds and guitar licks, completely jamming out before playing their hits. Long Beach native Bane’s World concluded the night at Mota Stage with their signature dreamy and sentimental sound. The small but loyal crowd was left hungry for more after the set was cut short.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As the sunset illuminated the Tropicalia stage and San Pedro Bay in an orange hue, the headliners began their sets. Café Tacvba, a renowned rock band from Mexico City, played a delightfully eclectic set that was paired with multiple outlandish outfit changes. The Spanish-speaking crowd emotionally sang along as they performed the romantic lyrics of “Como Te Extraño Mi Amor.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">King Krule was next. The sky was now dark and the crowd had anxiously formed around the stage waiting for the English rock sensation. With the release of his new album, <i>The OOZ</i>, followers were excited to hear songs off the album as well as classics like “Baby Blue” and “Easy Easy.” The stage went dark; King Krule stepped on stage with navy lights highlighting his silhouette. Emotionally rich, electrifying and riveting to the core is how we would describe the set, as the audience could feel the passion in his voice.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kali Uchis followed the energy of King Krule, delivering a truly sensational performance and touching the culture of the audience with her Latina prowess. Notably, she asked the crowd to raise their hands if they spoke Spanish, and 90 percent of the crowd proceeded to raise their hands. In Spanish and English she enchanted the crowd with her harmonic, jazz-like voice before humbly thanking and praising the crowd.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The next band truly embodied the essence of Tropicalia Fest, blending in rich Chicanx-culture storytelling with their psychedelic soul and funk heavy rock. Chicano Batman, native to L.A., was an emotional high point for many in the crowd. The politically empowering lyrics about the Mexican-American experience paired with their incredibly psychedelic visuals truly made an unforgettable experience.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For its first year, Tropicalia was a success. From its packed lineup to completely sold-out tickets, Tropicalia created a festival that celebrated the Latin American/Chicanx culture that allowed for this artistry to thrive. Whether you belonged to this cultural identity or not, the people were welcoming in the celebration of the organic culture they had created. Although the amazing performances made the day possible, Tropicalia was truly much more than that.
