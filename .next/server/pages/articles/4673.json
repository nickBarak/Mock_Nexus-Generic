So we just need to stay focused and stay healthy.”</p>\n<p>Irvine holds the third-best batting average in the Big West at .286 as a team thanks in large part to sophomore first baseman Connor Spencer and sophomore third baseman Taylor Sparks. Spencer hits 387, which leads the Big West, while Sparks maintains a .345 average.</p>\n<p>However talented the opposing offense may be, the Gaucho pitching staff has showed it is as good as any to shut down the opposition. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone leads the Big West in innings pitched with 79.2, and his 6-2 record and 2.60 ERA are tops among Santa Barbara starters.</p>\n<p>Following up Pettibone has been freshman pitcher Justin Jacome, who has been quite impressive in his own right this season. Jacome has thrown 65 innings en route to a 4-3 record on the season but has struck out 45 in that span. In his last outing against Riverside, Jacome struck out six and allowed just two hits over seven and two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>Irvine’s pitching staff has impressed as well this year, however, and will be a tough group for the UCSB offense to conquer. The Anteaters’ pitchers have a team ERA of just 3.18 this year and are second in the Big West at striking out opposing hitters.</p>\n<p>Behind both pitching staffs are some stellar defensive teams. The Anteaters lead the Big West with a .983 fielding percentage while the Gauchos hold perhaps one of the best shortstops in the league in junior Brandon Trinkwon.</p>\n<p>“We obviously need to come out and swing the bats. We have got some guys on the bump that are pretty special so we just need to see strikes and hit strikes,” Trinkwon said. “As far as defense, we just need to play behind our pitchers. We’re pretty good and have home field advantage, so that should help us a little bit. Besides that, we just need to play our game.”</p>\n<p>Over the last couple weeks, the Gauchos offense has really picked up the pace. They have outscored opponents 31-19 over the past four games. Leading the charge has been sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell, who earned Big West Player of the Week honors with his performance over his last four games.</p>\n<p>Newell went 9-14 with four RBI last week, including two three-hit performances. Newell has seen himself drop in the lineup from leadoff into more opportunistic RBI spots as his bat has continued to heat up. Since losing his 12-game hitting streak April 14, Newell has just started a new streak. He has hit safely now in eight games and has driven in at least one run in four of the last eight games.</p>\n<p>This weekend’s series will get under way on Friday afternoon at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. First pitch drops back an hour each day as Saturday’s game will begin at 2 p.m. and Sunday’s matchup starts at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51145\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51145\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/ucsb-looks-to-climb-the-big-west-standings/","id":4673,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4672,4671,4670],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Downed by San Diego on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8021.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8021.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"One game after handing first-place Cal State Fullerton its first loss in league play, the UCSB baseball team fell to the University of San Diego last night 7-5.

Then, with two outs, sophomore Tyler Kuresa drove in the third run of the inning with a double to right field.</p>\n<p>The Toreros would not go quietly, however, and responded in the bottom half of the third. With two outs, senior left fielder Dillon Checkal singled to get aboard in front of USD’s powerhouse junior third baseman Kris Bryant. Bryant promptly drove a two-run home run into left field for the 16th home run this year, bringing San Diego to within one at 3-2.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the fourth inning, San Diego struck again putting up four runs thanks to an RBI single by junior shortstop Logan Davis and a three-run home run by senior catcher Austin Green.</p>\n<p>In the top of the sixth, Kuresa hit a solo home run, his second of the year, to bring the Gauchos back within two. Bryant responded, however, in the bottom of the seventh with another home run, this one a solo shot, to bring his total to 17 on the season. The run was enough to seal the victory for San Diego, despite one last run from Santa Barbara in the eighth.</p>\n<p>Following the loss, UCSB will return home to face off with conference rivals Long Beach State over the weekend. The 49ers are 16-18 this year, but are 6-3 in Big West play, which is good for a three-way tie for second place behind Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Long Beach is currently riding a four-game win streak heading into Santa Barbara as they have just completed a sweep of UC Davis following a win against San Diego State last Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s sophomore starter Austin Pettibone will look to get the Gauchos on the right track as he will take the mound in game one of Friday. In his last outing, Pettibone held Fullerton to just two runs in seven-and-two-thirds innings. Pettibone leads UCSB with 64.1 innings pitched and his 2.80 ERA is tops among the Gaucho starters.</p>\n<p>Long Beach is the fourth-hardest team to score on in the Big West with a team ERA of 3.96 due in large part to junior pitcher Jake Stassi, who holds a 2.42 ERA in six starts, 10 appearances and holds a 4-1 record this season.</p>\n<p>Game one of the weekend series begins at 3 p.m. Friday afternoon with game two’s first pitch set for 2 p.m. on Saturday and the final game on Sunday slated for a 1 p.m. start time, all at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50892\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/ucsb-downed-by-san-diego-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50892\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/ucsb-downed-by-san-diego-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/ucsb-downed-by-san-diego-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/ucsb-downed-by-san-diego-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/ucsb-downed-by-san-diego-on-the-road/","id":4670,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4669,4668,4667],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Pound San Diego","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_Baseball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_Baseball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB baseball struck back yesterday afternoon, defeating the University of San Diego 12-4.

San Diego drops to 25-16 with the loss.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara got on the board first in the bottom of the second, putting a three spot on San Diego. Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa reached base on an error and would come around to score on a single by freshman third baseman Devon Gradford. After Gradford stolen base, Morrow would single in two more runs to start his 3-4 and four-RBI day.</p>\n<p>“They have some good arms and some pretty good guys on the mound, so it was really nice to put some good swings on balls,” Morrow said. “The RBIs just come from guys being in scoring position while I’m at bat, so thanks to those guys for helping me out a lot.”</p>\n<p>San Diego responded with two runs in the top of the third and another in the fifth on junior third baseman Kris Bryant’s home run, his 21st on the season. However, UCSB would score an incredible six runs in the seventh.</p>\n<p>Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell got the big inning started with a two-run single. Newell then stole second, but a throwing error brought in a run. Another base hit by freshman third baseman Ryan Clark would plate another before a two-run home run by Morrow would top off the inning and his impressive day at the plate.</p>\n<p>“Today I think we played really good team baseball and we have been playing better the last couple weeks,” Morrow said. “We pulled a game out at Fullerton and ever since then we’ve got on a little roll. Now we need to go into [Riverside] and play our brand of baseball.”</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos will be a trip to Riverside for a three-game series this weekend. The Highlanders are mired in a five-game losing streak and most recently lost to San Diego on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big weekend for us,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “Personally I’m excited; it’s my first time back as a coach since I coached there. I’ve been back to watch games and see friends, but I haven’t been in the other dugout to coach so I’m excited to see how our guys respond.”</p>\n<p>The five-game slide has included some incredibly one-sided defeats as well. On April 16 against UNLV, Riverside lost 11-24 to start the losing streak. Then on April 21 against UC Davis, they fell 8-19. The Highlander offense has been able to score enough runs to keep them in a typical game, but the pitching staff has been roughed up heavy as of late.</p>\n<p>Yet, the 17-19 Highlanders are in a tie with UCSB in the Big West standings at 6-6. As a result, this weekend will be a test for both teams as they both will have an opportunity to separate themselves in a tightly packed Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>The three-game series begins Friday evening at 6 p.m. at the Riverside Sports Complex. Saturday night’s game will also be a night game at 6 p.m. followed by Sunday’s series finale set for a 1 p.m. afternoon start time.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 25th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51027\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/gauchos-pound-san-diego/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51027\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/gauchos-pound-san-diego/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/gauchos-pound-san-diego/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/gauchos-pound-san-diego/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/gauchos-pound-san-diego/","id":4671,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4670,4669,4668],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Two of Three Against UC Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  The UCSB baseball team could not complete a weekend sweep for the second week in a row.

Riverside, on the other hand, moves to 18-21 and a 7-8 Big West record. Cal State Fullerton remains on top of the conference at 11-3.</p>\n<p>On Friday, UCSB came away with a victory in a high scoring affair. The Gauchos got things started in the top of the first, scoring four runs on six hits in the inning. Junior outfielder Joey Epperson led the game off with a double. After a sacrifice bunt moved him to third, sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward drove him in for the game’s first run.</p>\n<p>Freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic followed with a double to bring home Woodward to record his first RBI of the night. Nesovic would finish with three hits, three runs and three RBI.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders came back with two runs in the home half of the first as well as three more in the second to take the lead through two. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone allowed five runs, two earned, through seven innings of work to improve to 6-2 on the year.</p>\n<p>Down 5-4, UCSB scored three in the third to retake the lead and another three in the sixth for good measure. Riverside was able to plate two runs in the bottom of the ninth but freshman closer Dylan Hecht would come on and close out the game for his fifth save of the year.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night runs were at a premium as the Gauchos would go on to win 2-0. Freshman starting pitcher Justin Jacome was lights out as he allowed just two hits and two walks through seven and two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>“Jacome really threw the ball well,” Checketts said. “He threw a lot of strikes and had really good fastball command. He did a really nice job.”</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Ben Doucette was the tough luck loser in that one as he threw seven innings and allowed just one unearned run in the sixth inning for Riverside. The Gauchos would tack on another run on an Epperson single in the eighth before Hecht came on to collect his second save of the weekend.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s finale, Riverside was able to put up five runs in the first inning to take a commanding lead early. Junior starting pitcher Cameron Cuneo allowed five unearned runs through two and two-thirds innings before being relieved by Nesovic in the third.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was able to get one across in the second inning and came to within one after a three-run home run by sophomore Tyler Kuresa in the fifth.</p>\n<p>Nesovic was unable to keep the Highlanders at bay, however, as he allowed three runs in the eighth. In the final at bats for UCSB, Kuresa added an RBI double in the ninth to attempt a comeback but the Gauchos would ultimately fall 8-5.</p>\n<p>Coming up for the Gauchos will be a home series against UC Irvine on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1931207429\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51090\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51091\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-29/gauchos-take-two-of-three-against-uc-riverside/markbrocher_baseball_4-19-2013_dsc_2645/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645.jpg?fit=4800%2C3200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4800,3200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366385012\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"110\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51091\" alt=\"markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2645-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 29, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of The Daily Nexus.<br>\n</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51090\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-29/gauchos-take-two-of-three-against-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51090\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-29/gauchos-take-two-of-three-against-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-29/gauchos-take-two-of-three-against-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-29/gauchos-take-two-of-three-against-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-29/gauchos-take-two-of-three-against-uc-riverside/","id":4672,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4671,4670,4669],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
