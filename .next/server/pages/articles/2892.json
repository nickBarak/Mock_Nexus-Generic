For most other surfers, the ride is more challenging, more tiring, not as fast and not constantly filmed in HD by surf paparazzi. Rodeo flips and pro tournaments may be more than a little out of reach for myself and 99 percent of the rest of the surf world.</p>\n<p>People always say to me, “I wish I had started surfing earlier. It’s too late to start now,” or “I started too late, I won’t be able to become a good surfer.” Ugh. What pessimism. Don’t you unenlightened landlubbers get anything?</p>\n<p>Surfing is not about the babes, being able to boost air or getting a tanned bod. Surfing is not about the contests, the World Championship Tour or corporate sponsorship. It’s not even about Betzaida’s mouthwatering heiny.</p>\n<p>There’s real magic to the sport of kings. When you submerge yourself in surfing’s depth, waves become your spiritual fuel. The rhythmic bob of the tide is your pulse. Paddling is your breath, the spray of saltwater your speech.</p>\n<p>I’ve met people fifty years my senior who can surf with more skill, patience and style than myself. I’ve read accounts and seen videos of surfers in their 80s and 90s still going strong. They’re the inspired ones, the people I aspire to be. It’s not because they’ve become more used to balancing on their surfboard, more accurate at predicting waves or even more crafty at maneuvering the lineup, but because they’ve been able to keep the soul-buzzing feeling of the session in their lives even past their physical prime.</p>\n<p>There’s a certain delighted twinkle that manifests in the eyes of lifelong surfers. It’s almost an “I know something you don’t know” kind of jesting taunt. But when that soul surfer happens to talk about his or her experiences and smile — a smile that connects the whole mouth and eyes into a portrait of bubbly excitement — you begin to understand what a lifetime of soul adventure can do for one’s spirit.</p>\n<p>If you do it right, surfing will fulfill you, provide you purpose, bliss, satisfaction, exercise, community and challenge. The first step is entering the water with an open mind. The next step is to return to the water frequently. The final step is to stay positive and grateful to have at least a moment to float by yourself, with your buds or perhaps just the dolphins and fish.</p>\n<p>So don’t “what if” your surfing prospects. Don’t “I could’ve been a surfer had I started earlier”  yourself. Just give it a try, stay respectful and stay at it.</p>\n<p>Remember — it’s right there, and it’s good for you.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld was very disappointed with his second-place finish in the ass contest.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29944\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/nuglets-wisdom-lifer-ass/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29944\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/nuglets-wisdom-lifer-ass/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/nuglets-wisdom-lifer-ass/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/nuglets-wisdom-lifer-ass/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/nuglets-wisdom-lifer-ass/","id":2892,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2891,2890,2889],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld","biography":"Not available","articles":[2122,2138,2149,2167,2259,2288,2298,2299,2381,2765,2788,2794,2862,2892,3000,3128,3161,3529,3534],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Clippers: Recovery Possible, As Usual, After a Bad Start","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"No matter how many games they lose, coaches they fire, first round flops they pick and players in their prime they let go, the Clippers never let you down.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>This column appeared in the Daily Nexus under the header “He Said, He Said: The L.A.

You hold your breath after every mild success, ever number-one draft pick and every two-game winning streak — waiting for something to go wrong, waiting for them to fuck it up. Then you bitch about it once they inevitably do. </p>\n<p>That’s what it means to be a Clippers fan.</p>\n<p>Still, I sit here after the Clippers have fallen to 1-6, fully prepared to talk about why this is the year everything changes. For the Clippers, 1-6 is the new 1-2. It’s a disappointing start, but they can still recover.</p>\n<p>There’s some pride involved with loving a team so shitty they only sell out games when the Lakers are playing them. We’re a distinct bunch, Clipper fans. We’re used to empty arenas, cheap tickets, waiting until the end of a SportsCenter broadcast for highlights that never come.</p>\n<p>When I showed these first few paragraphs to the Artsweek guy, the dude who wrote about Miami’s pending dominance last week, he said nothing helpful, walked back over to his office and yelled back, “Who cares?”</p>\n<p>Before that, I told the Opinion girl about what I was about to write and she said, “Really? Why?” with one of those looks that hot girls give to short ugly guys with no money who try to hit on them. Then she talked about how well the Lakers played this weekend, just like everybody does.</p>\n<p>I’ve been going to Clippers games since I was six. I remember feeling sorry for Brent Barry, who would stand in a corner outside the Clippers’ locker room at the Sports Arena in silence while all the kids would crowd around Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill and young Kobe. I remember sitting right above the Clippers bench when Michael Jordan, in the legendary black Bulls jersey with the pinstripes, dropped 49 in 1998 to beat us in double overtime.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, I was home watching the Clippers’ road loss to the Jazz. The Clips were up by 18 at one point. Three quarters later they were only up by seven. Then they were tied. Then they were down by seven. Blake Griffin fouled out with two minutes left. As usual, it looked like it was all over.</p>\n<p>Then the Clippers went on a run, as usual. Eric Gordon started shitting all over everybody. With eight seconds left in regulation, he crossed over two dudes and dunked on two others, tying the game and sending it into overtime. I jumped and yelled and ran around the family room. My little sister rolled her eyes and resumed watching Mary Poppins on her stupid little DVD player.</p>\n<p>Two overtimes later, they lost anyway. Now they’re 1-6 instead of 2-5. I haven’t compiled the stats, but I can almost guarantee the Clippers have been on the losing end of overtime games more than any other NBA team.</p>\n<p>There’s always hope with the Clippers, and the Clippers always take that hope away and leave you longing for that hope all over again. They’re an addiction.</p>\n<p>Once they’re that .500 team that inches their way into the playoffs, which they will be, I’ll be there. Then I’ll be there when they lose, and when they trade Griffin away for a first round pick in 2013. The cycle will continue.</p>\n<p>But this is their year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Active Minds student organization hosted a panel discussion for National Eating Disorder Awareness week on Wednesday at the Loma Pelona Center with six panelists from the Hosford Counseling and Psychological Services Clinic, the Isla Vista Food Co-op, Student Health and the Department of Counseling, Clinical and School Psychology (CCSP).</p>\n<p>The panelists discussed how to recognize the complexities of eating disorders, warning signs and coping strategies, as well as resources available on campus for those suffering from eating disorders. Throughout the event, Active Minds aimed to encourage discussion on the changing climate of the conversation on eating disorders and how to decrease the stigma surrounding the issue.</p>\n<p>Health and Wellness advisor Joanna Hill said because eating disorders are unique from many other addictions, they can be difficult to treat.</p>\n<p>“Eating disorders are different than other addictions, like alcohol or drugs because you have to eat every day,” Hill said. “CAPS [Counseling &amp; Psychological Services] is a good starting place. With eating disorders, the ideal trifecta is a registered dietician, a medical doctor and counseling or a therapist, and so if you go into any one of those areas they can help connect you into the rest of the resources.”</p>\n<p>Hosford Counseling and Psychological Services Clinic eating disorder specialist Lana Smith Hale said eating disorders are a coping mechanism that are usually linked to deeper issues.</p>\n<p>“Finding what that is for each person is part of what the experience of like working on your issues,” Smith Hale said. “The deeper issues might be anxiety, depression, obsessive thoughts, trauma, low self-esteem, family issues – it can vary. Eating disorders aren’t about the food, it’s usually about something deeper.”</p>\n<p>Smith Hale said people suffering from eating disorders should be encouraged to reach out for support and educated on how to connect with resources.</p>\n<p>“For somebody who has an eating disorder, to really take that step is such an act of strength to reach out for support,” Smith Hale said. “If that means calling a friend, getting involved with a new club, going to student health, going to CAPS, but beginning to take that step forward is so important in getting help.”</p>\n<p>Active Minds co-founder and fourth-year psychology major Lilia Goldenberg said she is passionate about mental health because herself and her family members have dealt with mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that runs in my family,” Goldenberg said. “It’s something that I’ve had so many friends talk to about. It’s prevalent in my life. Something I’ve always noticed is that a lot of people don’t talk about it in open spaces and it comes out in ways that aren’t necessarily healthy ways it may come out.”</p>\n<p>Active Minds co-founder and fourth-year communication and psychology double-major Carly Chianese said she feels strongly about eliminating the stigma surrounding eating disorders.</p>\n<p>“I just think it’s very important to start the conversation about mental health and that is what this club stands for,” Chianese said. “Just that it can be such a cathartic experience even if you’re not suffering yourself to be able to alleviate some of those feelings … and to educate our campus because the more people know, the less people are going to stigmatize.”</p>\n<p>According to Goldenberg, it is important that university campuses provide a variety of resources for individuals struggling with eating disorders.</p>\n<p>“It creates a space where people can talk about things. Instead of just talking to your friends about it, which isn’t always the most comfortable space to, they can come here and be with likeminded people,” Goldenberg said. “It’s difficult to reach communities that don’t want to be reached. So we’re trying to get people whose ears haven’t already heard the story.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Co-op manager Melissa Cohen said the Co-op can help individuals who are suffering with eating disorders by helping “to create community through food.”</p>\n<p>“Our store has become what it was meant to be, which is a hub for education, outreach, tours, nutrition education,” Cohen said. “It’s not really about doing all your shopping at the Co-op, it’s about knowing there’s a place in the community that brings together people, community and food into one place to create a really fun shopping experience. Our mission is not selling groceries, our mission is creating access to healthy food in the most affordable way possible.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said the Co-op can help everyone, including those with eating disorders, to get access to healthy food and learn about nutrition.</p>\n<p>“When I was a student the Co-op wasn’t that big of a part of my life, but as I became more invested in food … I saw how the Co-op should be more of a resource for students,” Cohen said. “We’re helping to make it more inclusive, open to everyone, more affordable. It’s less about serving one particular part of our community, more about being open to everyone. Access to healthy food should not be a privilege. It’s a right.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major Gena Sherman said the event opened the public’s eyes to resources available on campus for individuals with eating disorders.</p>\n<p>“I really liked the overall vibe of support that there was,” Sherman said. “I felt like everyone was here for the right reasons.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed Goldenberg’ s quotes to having prior personal experience with eating disorders. Her quote actually pertained to experience with mental health disorders in general, not eating disorders specifically.

So did fellow senior center Bryce Welke, junior defender Jacob Wiskel and the five other members that made up the core eight of the team, which plays two home games at the closest rink in Oxnard on Friday and Saturday against Sacramento State.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Every one of these kids … none of us ever thought we’d ever play ice hockey again,” Wiskel said. “We were all former ice players, just playing roller hockey because it was the only thing around.”</p>\n<p>With no funds other than team dues, no place to play, no jerseys and no skates, the group of eight roller hockey players turned themselves into to a Division 3 club squad in a matter of months, equipped with a 16-man roster, a student coach and white home jerseys. They play their home matches at the Channel Islands Ice Center in Oxnard and hold a spot in the Pacific Collegiate Hockey Association.</p>\n<p>“We were the only team out of the four [trying to get in] to get voted in unanimously,” Snyder said. “From there it was all advertising and trying to get people aware. Me, Jake, and a couple other guys … we just thought, ‘Let’s figure out what we have to do to make this a team.’”</p>\n<p>I met Snyder and Wiskel outside the Isla Vista Starbucks on the type of warm November evening that reminds you why people like California. Snyder’s smaller than I expected him to be — listed at 5’9’’, 165 on the Web site that Welke created — and isn’t as ripped as you’d expect from a hockey player. Snyder’s a nice guy that knows the end game, asking me before we’re even seated if the article I’m writing is going to be “a front-page kind of deal.”</p>\n<p>Wiskel, listed at 6’3’’, 190, looks much more like the stereotypical hockey player. He shows up a little later and lets Snyder do most of the talking, interrupting when Snyder claims the team could have tried procuring funds from Associated Students.</p>\n<p>“I did,” he said, before adding that the team was “self-funded.”</p>\n<p>“There’s no money from the school, no money from Rec Sports,” he said. “We’re trying to get a sponsor but it’s hard when you don’t have a rink near campus. You can’t convince Freebirds to put up a jersey when we’re playing that far away right now.”</p>\n<p>Goleta is likely to soon be home to a new skating rink called Ice in Paradise, which will serve as the team’s new home once the project is completed. According to Campaign Director Ada Conner, as soon as the Greater Santa Barbara Ice Skating Association raises $6 million, the project will break ground. The group has raised $2.5 million so far since the land, located next to Girsh Park, was donated to the cause.</p>\n<p>“I’m quite positive we will be breaking ground in 2011,” Conner said.</p>\n<p>This season, the team has 10 more games to play. CSUN and College of the Canyons, both PCHA teams advanced to the American Collegiate Hockey Association National Tournament last season. After three years as a self-funded club the team will be eligible to apply to become a team under UCSB’s Rec Cen Sports.</p>\n<p>“The best thing about it is everybody’s amped on playing,” Snyder said. “That’s kind of what it is with guys that played ice hockey in high school, [especially] after high school if you’re not going to the show.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s match, an exhibition against Sacramento State, begins at 9 p.m. Saturday’s official league match against the same team begins at 6:30 p.m. Although the time is not officially posted, Snyder expects a team-funded bus for fans from Isla Vista to leave at 5:30 p.m. for Oxnard.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28932\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/wait-ucsb-ice-hockey-team/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28932\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/wait-ucsb-ice-hockey-team/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/wait-ucsb-ice-hockey-team/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/wait-ucsb-ice-hockey-team/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/wait-ucsb-ice-hockey-team/","id":2891,"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia"},"related":[2890,2889,2888],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
