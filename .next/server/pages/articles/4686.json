The Gauchos secured a sweep of UC Davis winning 10-5, 8-1 and 5-3. The sweep secured the Gauchos second place in the Big West Conference and on Monday morning, they were voted into the NCAA Baseball Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We are excited about the playoffs,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We were on pins and needles going into the selection show. It didn’t go quite how we expected. It felt like we were deserving and a team that could do some damage. It felt like we should get in there but with our RPI so low we were nervous.”</p>\n<p>The sweep moved the Gauchos to 34-23 overall and into a tie for second place in the Big West Conference with Cal Poly at 17-10 in conference play. UC Davis fell to 19-37 and 5-22 in the Big West, finishing in last place this season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In game one of the three game series on Thursday against the Aggies, the Gaucho offense exploded for 10 runs and 14 hits to defeat Davis 10-5. Sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward had himself a day as he led the charge, going 4-4 with four runs batted in and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>Senior third baseman Marc Venning and freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic each had a couple hits and had two RBI each in the 10 run outburst.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been hitting the ball real well the last couple of weeks in my opinion,” Venning said. “We had a lot of runners on base but we didn’t always score them but we just kept pounding away and eventually we ended up scoring some runs. We executed a lot better in the first two games which led to us putting up a bunch of runs.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone completed his final start of the regular season by throwing eight innings. He earned his ninth win as he allowed four runs and struck out four. Pettibone ends the regular season as the Big West Conference leader in innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Game two of the weekend series was another trouncing of the Aggies as the Gaucho offense continued to fire on all cylinders. UCSB scored eight runs on 15 hits in the 8-1 victory.</p>\n<p>Joey Epperson was the spark plug from the leadoff position, reaching base five times as he went 4-4 on the day with a hit by pitch, two doubles, an RBI, three runs scored and two stolen bases.</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa took advantage of the teams on base ability as they each drove in two runs.</p>\n<p>Woodward left game two with a knee injury and sat out of Saturday’s finale but should be able to play going forward.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Davis slowed down the Gaucho high flying offense but was unable to stop them from completing the three-game sweep. Sophomore Andrew Vasquez pitched just two and two thirds innings before being relieved by sophomore pitcher Greg Mahle, who earned his seventh win of the year with his five and a third shutout innings.</p>\n<p>Filling in for the injured Woodward, freshman second baseman Ryan Clark made sure there was nothing lost as he drove in three runs on Saturday, a career-high.</p>\n<p>After five innings, the two teams were tied 3-3, but Kuresa put the Gauchos on top with a solo home run, his fifth of the year, to give his team a lead that would be held by freshman pitcher Dylan Hecht‘s eighth and final save of the regular season.</p>\n<p>This will be the Gauchos’ first postseason since 2001. The postseason will begin on Friday, May 31, as UCSB will take on Texas A&amp;M in the Corvallis Regional, hosted by Oregon State.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 28, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51579\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/ucsb-sweeps-davis-secures-ncaa-tournament-bid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51579\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/ucsb-sweeps-davis-secures-ncaa-tournament-bid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/ucsb-sweeps-davis-secures-ncaa-tournament-bid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/ucsb-sweeps-davis-secures-ncaa-tournament-bid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-28/ucsb-sweeps-davis-secures-ncaa-tournament-bid/","id":4686,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4685,4684,4683],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Wins Final Two Games to Take Third Straight Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8060.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8060.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team won its third conference series in a row this weekend, going 2-1 against UC Irvine.

Every single out he has had has been hit hard,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “That’s the right guy to have at the plate. He does everything right and he is prepared. He absolutely deserved [the walk off] because the way that he has handled himself in the dugout and practice.”</p>\n<p>With the series victory, UCSB moves up to 25-20 on the year and 10-8 in the Big West Conference, just one game behind Irvine and Cal Poly for third place. The Anteaters, meanwhile, drop to 29-15 and 11-7 in conference.</p>\n<p>In Fridays game one of the series, the Gauchos pitching staff allowed the most runs they have in a single game all season. Sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone, who had been lights out as the staff’s ace, was crushed by the Anteaters. He gave up a season high nine runs through just five and a third innings for his shortest outing of the year.</p>\n<p>Both teams were able to put up two runs in the first inning, but the Gauchos scored one in the third and three in the fourth to take a 6-2 lead. UCSB chased junior starting pitcher Andrew Thurman after just four innings of work as he allowed six runs on 10 hits.</p>\n<p>“[Friday] was a weird day because their guy was throwing and he is projected to be a second or third round draft pick and our guy was going and he is a sophomore and not draft eligible but pretty good,” Checketts said. “Both these guys have been leaders in the conference for ERA, so going into it you think it’s going to be a 2-1 ballgame, but they both got roughed up.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did not hold the lead long however, as Irvine returned with a run in the fifth and exploded for seven in the sixth to jump on Pettibone. Three consecutive doubles topped off the inning that was then followed by a four-run seventh.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would go on to score a run in each of the final three innings but would ultimately fall 14-9 in game one.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB bounced back to tie the series with a 5-3 win thanks to a quality spot start by freshman pitcher Robby Nesovic.</p>\n<p>“Against Riverside Justin Jacome rolled his ankle so he is out two to three weeks. He did it covering first and ended up pitching two more innings on it but now the doc has shut him down,” Checketts said. “The freshmen did a good job of picking up the freshman. Nesovic threw enough strikes and was able to battle out of some jams.”</p>\n<p>Not only was Nesovic impressive on the mound, throwing six innings and allowing just three runs, but he also went 3-3 at the plate and helped his own cause with a solo home run in the bottom of the seventh.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters were able to tag him for three runs on a home run by senior right fielder Scott Gottschling to tie the game in the top of the sixth, but sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward came back to break the tie in the bottom of the sixth to take the lead and set up freshman pitcher Dylan Hecht’s seventh save which included him striking out the side.</p>\n<p>In the rubber game of the weekend series, the Gauchos sent sophomore Andrew Vasquez to the hill after a successful return last weekend after he had been out for a month. He pitched five and a third innings and allowed three runs on five hits while striking out six.</p>\n<p>“The key point of this game is that we got Andrew Vasquez back and he looked the part,” Checketts said. “He wasn’t perfect, but he sure looked like his old self and maybe a little bit better than his old self. He threw enough strikes and was really good.”</p>\n<p>Epperson led off the bottom of the first with a single and scored the game’s first run on a Woodward single. In the third, junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and Woodward each drove in a run to put the Gauchos ahead 3-0.</p>\n<p>Irvine fought back in the fourth on a two-run home run by Gottschling, his second in two days. The Anteaters would then tie the game in the sixth and take the lead in the seventh, a lead they would hold until the bottom of the ninth inning.</p>\n<p>After taking on an insurance run in the top of the ninth UCI led 6-4 with just three outs to go. Red hot sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell singled to lead off the inning and extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Newell stole second and came around to score on a sacrifice fly.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos down by just the one run allowed in the top of the inning, Epperson stepped to the plate with the tying run on first base. Epperson crushed the first pitch he saw to left center field for the walk off two-run home run.</p>\n<p>“Obviously I was just in the right place at the right time and I got rewarded for it,” Epperson said. “My at bat is just a testament to the guys before me putting quality at bats together and that’s what we’re all about. We pass the baton and pick each other up.”</p>\n<p>Coming up next for the Gauchos will be a three-game road series with Cal State Northridge this Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The Matadors currently sit in second place in the Big West, four games ahead of UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of  May 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51195\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51195\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/ucsb-wins-final-two-games-to-take-third-straight-series/","id":4683,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4682,4681,4680],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Baseball for Austin Pettibone: A Family Affair","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8304.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8304.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"When Andrew Checketts took over the UCSB baseball team as both head coach and pitching coach, it was not very surprising to see the surge in performance of his pitching staff in just the first season....","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When Andrew Checketts took over the UCSB baseball team as both head coach and pitching coach, it was not very surprising to see the surge in performance of his pitching staff in just the first season. This season, he has groomed his pitchers into one of the top pitching teams in the Big West conference.</p>\n<p>Of the solid group that Checketts has at his disposal, the team’s ace, sophomore Austin Pettibone has truly been impressive. Just two years in to his college career, Pettibone has made a major stamp as one of the top pitchers in the Big West. In his first year he compiled a 4.44 ERA over 79 innings pitched. He made 17 appearances, 13 starts, led the staff with his eight wins and even earned a save.</p>\n<p>“The thing that really stands out about [Austin] is his will to prepare,” Checketts said. “He is committed to preparing and committed to his work ethic and doing things right and so he competes every day. He shows up and competes in the weight room and competes in practice and that translates to him going out every Friday.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This year he has upped his game as he leads the Gauchos with 12 games started, six wins, 85 innings pitched and leads all UCSB starters with a 3.39 ERA. Among the conference, Pettibone has thrown the most innings and sits at seventh with his six wins.</p>\n<p>“His stuff has gotten better,” Checketts said. “He has added about 3-4 miles an hour to his fastball, his change-up has been better, his curveball has improved from where it was and still probably has one more jump to make. He shows it in the bullpen and it hasn’t quite translated to the game yet consistently, but he is really committed.”</p>\n<p>On March 15, Pettibone had himself a career performance, pitching a complete game shutout against Sacramento State. He allowed just four hits and did not walk a batter over the course of the game as well as compiling a season-high six strikeouts to lead the Gauchos to a 5-0 victory.</p>\n<p>“My complete game shutout this year was [a] pretty cool experience,” Pettibone said. “I threw like 79 pitches. Everything was working and everything was going my way, so it was just a really great feeling as a pitcher.”</p>\n<p>Despite his exceptional play so far this season, Austin Pettibone may not even be having the most exciting year of the Pettibone family. On April 22, his older brother Jonathan Pettibone made his first career major league start with the Philadelphia Phillies against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Jonathan threw five and a third innings as he struck out six while allowing six hits and just two runs in his debut.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty awesome; I got to go out there when he had his debut out in Philly,” Pettibone said. “It was just a great experience to see him out there and he actually threw pretty well so it was just a really great experience.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan has continued to pitch well as he has thrown two more games and has earned a win in both — one against the New York Mets and another versus the Miami Marlins. He is also set to pitch tonight against the San Francisco Giants.</p>\n<p>In his three starts in the Major Leagues, Jonathan has earned a 2-0 record and a 3.24 ERA with 13 strikeouts in 16.2 innings. He also has given up just two walks in the three games, something that is a major problem for most young starters as the grand stage has been known to rattle up-and-comers.</p>\n<p>“All the scouts and announcers and whoever always mention his composure on the mound whether things are going his way or if they’re not,” Pettibone said. “He even helped with staying calm in those types of situations. Keeping my composure.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan is perhaps showing himself as a potential big leaguer to stay. With the recent injury to former Cy Young award winner Roy Halladay, Pettibone may just get a chance to lock down a spot in the Phillies‘ rotation.</p>\n<p>Jonathan was drafted in the third round in 2008 by the Phillies and signed out of high school.</p>\n<p>“It’s really cool growing up with him in the minor leagues,” Pettibone said. “Watching him grind it out and get better from year to year and get better and get stronger and then finally it paid off and he has got his debut this year. It’s just been cool growing up with that the last five years.”</p>\n<p>Jonathan and Austin’s father Jay had made it to the big leagues in 1983, so with a past of pitching the two young men seemed to have their sights set.</p>\n<p>“Since I was five years old I was throwing the baseball around and playing tee ball,” Pettibone said. “We were all pitchers and I have a cousin that’s a pitcher in high school right now. It’s just been a Pettibone thing to be a pitcher.”</p>\n<p>The two brothers still have a long way to go before the season ends, but they’re certainly set to continue their great years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 8th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/baseball-for-austin-pettibone-a-family-affair/","id":4684,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4683,4682,4681],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls in Close Game to No. 8 UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8441.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.23.2013_DSC_8441.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team’s prospects of making the postseason have seemingly disappeared with Tuesday night’s loss to No. 8 UCLA, 2-1.

Junior left fielder Joey Epperson led off the game by getting hit by a pitch. With the leadoff man aboard, junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon executed a sacrifice bunt to move the base runner into scoring position with just one out.</p>\n<p>Number three hitter sophomore Woody Woodward had a productive out as his ground ball to third still managed to advance Epperson to third on the play. With two outs and a runner on third base, sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa did what he does best and drove in the go-ahead run with a base hit into left-center field.</p>\n<p>Before the Gauchos could attempt a two-out rally, however, Kuresa was caught stealing second base to end the inning, and about all the offense the Gauchos would muster all night.</p>\n<p>“We were trying to trick them with a delayed steal,” Checketts said. “We actually had them and it would have worked, but the pitcher missed and the throw was up almost like a pitchout and the catcher was able to see it. I think if it was a different pitch he would have been safe at second.”</p>\n<p>The Bruins would come back to tie the game in the bottom half of the second inning. Junior shortstop Pat Valaika led off the inning with a triple into right-center field. A follow-up single by junior second baseman Kevin Williams would score Valaika and tie the score 1-1.</p>\n<p>Freshman starting pitcher Justin Jacome worked his way out of the second-inning jam thanks to an inning-ending double play and eventually got locked up in a pitchers duel as both starters settled down after shaky early innings.</p>\n<p>The Bruins freshman starting pitcher Cody Poteet was able to shut down the surging Gaucho offense Tuesday evening. Poteet went six strong innings, allowing just one run on one hit with just one walk and three strikeouts. Jacome pitched strong as well, but was not quite as stellar as he allowed two runs through five and two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t get a lot of hits and we didn’t execute,” Checketts said. “We knew it was going to be a low-scoring and detailed game but we weren’t able to get an out on a bunt and that hurt us. We had a chance to win 2-1 or 1-0 but we didn’t get an out on a bunt play.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will finish up the regular season this weekend with a three-game series on the road at UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51517\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/ucsb-falls-in-close-game-to-no-8-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51517\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/ucsb-falls-in-close-game-to-no-8-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/ucsb-falls-in-close-game-to-no-8-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/ucsb-falls-in-close-game-to-no-8-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/ucsb-falls-in-close-game-to-no-8-ucla/","id":4685,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4684,4683,4682],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
