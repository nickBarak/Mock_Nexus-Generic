Seeing this, the officers perked up, happy to enforce their zero tolerance policy, and made their way toward the suave partier.</p>\n<p>Noticing his tail, the Keystone King tucked in behind some cars and ditched his kingly can, but it was too late. The deputies caught up and asked the inebriated man why he was drinking in the street. The Goleta resident, a classy man by nature, took the high road and told them, “I know, I’m drunk in public.”</p>\n<p>Despite the confession, the officers continued to prod and asked the self-described drunk if he knew where he was. Confidently, he answered, “Del Trigo.”</p>\n<p>Convinced he was, in fact, drunk in public, the deputies sat the man on the curb and slapped on handcuffs. With this, the intoxicated man became aggravated and asked his arresting officers, “Why you messing with me? Look at all these people doing cocaine, and shit like that.”</p>\n<p>A quick glance into the street revealed no cocaine, however, and deputies calmly explained why they were “messing” with him. The deputies later transported the man to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>It’s Good, but Not That Good…</b></p>\n<p>Friday, Jan. 29, 3:47 p.m. — Domino’s new and improved pizza brought one drunken man to his knees… and into the hands of the law.</p>\n<p>Resisting the allure of fluffy, distinctly cardboard-free crust and bubbling, now-made-from-real-milk cheese, the deputies were walking past the I.V. pizzeria when they spotted the grown man blocking the entrance.</p>\n<p>The 44-year-old — a local resident — was kneeling just in front of the door with a nearly empty 24-ounce bottle of malt liquor sitting beside him. The clearly inebriated man had a wad of crumpled dollar bills in one hand and was yelling at the patrons gathered around him. While his words were unintelligible, one could only guess he was shouting about the greatness that is the new Domino’s pizza.</p>\n<p>As the deputies approached, they watched as the “pizza man” lost his balance and face-planted into the cement. He righted himself, only to fall face-first again. This was repeated several times until the officers arrived and arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending discovery of the telephone.</p>\n<p><b>Neighborly Love</b></p>\n<p>Friday, Jan. 30, 2:31 a.m. — Deputies working the late shift were called to 6500 block of Seville on reports of a fight.</p>\n<p>Some time earlier, two men had been sitting in their apartment when they heard a knock on their door. They opened it to find their neighbor, heavily intoxicated and royally pissed about something.</p>\n<p>The 21-year-old was too drunk to use words however, and instead just punched his neighbor in the face. The motion proved too violent, however, as the inebriated man lost his balance and fell backward down the stairs.</p>\n<p>When the officers arrived, they found the pugnacious partier standing in the courtyard, bleeding from the cheek. The deputies attempted to talk with him, but all he would say was something about his neighbors “disrespecting” him.</p>\n<p>Unable to get any more out of him, the deputies arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Of course we’re going to protest,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara 1969 oil leak spilled an estimated 3 million gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean. According to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, it was the worst oil spill in the nation’s history until 20 years later, when the Exxon Valdez dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil off the coast of Alaska.</p>\n<p>Following the Refugio oil spill of 2015 that spilled 80,000 gallons of crude oil, state and federal legislators enacted new laws, and Santa Barbara County worked alongside local environmental organizations to draft a plan of action in the event of a future pipe leak, as the <i>Nexus</i> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/effects-of-2015-oil-spill-persist-researchers-say/\">previously reported</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite such efforts, Zinke proposed on March 6 a region-wide, 73-million-acre lease sale offshore of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for oil and gas exploration and development.</p>\n<p>This lease sale will go into effect Aug. 16, 2017, which the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said will grant leases to the highest bidder for exploration.</p>\n<p>Davis said the SBSC put out a petition asking Zinke to not open up new offshore leases in the Santa Barbara County in hopes of preventing future pipe leaks. She said the petition has over 17,000 signatures.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to deliver it and that he gets the message that if they are going to open up [leases], there is going to be a real push back and a lot of opposition,” Davis said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77064\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77064\" data-attachment-id=\"77064\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/environmentalists-protest-arctic-oil-drilling-naysayers-wine-about-it/fullsizerender-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-77064\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77064\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Local environmental groups spoke out against plans to expand offshore oil drilling amidst a visit by Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke to Santa Barbara on Monday. <em>Stephany Rubio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Of the 470 leases issued in the Pacific Ocean, 43 are active.

The deputies asked the 19-year-old if he had any identification with him and he told them, in thick, slurred speech, that it was in his pocket.</p>\n<p>The intoxicated reveler then reached into his pocket and, in so doing, pulled his pants down to his knees. Embarrassed, the pantsless partier tried to re-cover himself but was simply too drunk to do so. Luckily, the I.V. Foot Patrol are trained for all manner of situation, and one of the deputies was able to assist in pulling the exposed man’s trousers back up.</p>\n<p>With one disaster averted, the deputies moved on and asked the beltless boozer if he knew what street he was on. He replied he was on “Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>While no doubt a reasonable drunken answer, the deputies formed the opinion that the wasted walker was just too drunk and arrested him for public intoxication. He was later transferred to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>An I.V. Wizz</b></p>\n<p>Sun, Jan. 24, 12:47 p.m. — Deputies on a uniformed patrol watched as an inebriated reveler veered off the sidewalk, stumbled over some landscaping and face planted into a hedge of bushes.</p>\n<p>The officers, standing near the intersection of Camino Pescadero and Sabado Tarde, made their way towards the not-so-sure-footed drinker as he worked his way out of the bush. Getting to his feet, the 20-year-old made a step back towards the sidewalk, caught his foot on an innocent shrub, and went toppling back towards the ground.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived, helped the defeated drunk to his feet, and asked his name. He responded by muttering something undistinguishable. Not terribly surprised by the answer, the officers shrugged it off and asked him where he lived. While not quite a real street, his reply “Sabo Ardo” was at least close.</p>\n<p>It was at this point that the deputies picked up on the rancid smell of urine wafting through the air, and a quick glance at the reveler’s crotch confirmed he was the source. The urine stains were not confined to his jeans, however. Dark spots on his jacket sleeves suggested he had also managed to piss on his arms.</p>\n<p>Taking extra care not to get too much urine on their hands, the officers slapped cuffs on the pee-stained partier and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20068\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20068\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/","id":3827,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3826,3825,3824],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"An especially intoxicated man stumbled out the front door of Freebirds, catching the attention of nearby officers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Birthday Blues</b></p>\n<p>Thur., Feb. 25, 1:46 a.m. — An especially intoxicated man stumbled out the front door of Freebirds, catching the attention of nearby officers.</p>\n<p>It was not, however, the first time that night the deputies had seen the young man, who was being held up by three of his friends. Two hours earlier, the boozed burrito-buyer had nearly eaten shit right in front of the officers, not a block from Freebirds.</p>\n<p>At that time, the inebriated man was all alone. He told the officers it was his 21st birthday, which his ID confirmed, and they allowed him to call for a sober escort. When Jesus, his friend and savior, arrived minutes later, the deputies told him to take his legally drunk friend straight home.</p>\n<p>When the officers later spotted the blacked-out birthday boy outside Freebirds, he was even more intoxicated. The officers asked why he wasn’t at home, and he told them that he was still trying to find his way.</p>\n<p>His birthday nearly two hours past, the deputies felt no remorse in leading the 21-year-old to a bed… at the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Where’s Amy?</b></p>\n<p>Sat., Feb. 27, 1:50 a.m. — Deputies working the late shift were called to the 6600 block of Trigo Road on reports that someone was disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p>When the officers arrived, they spotted a young man pounding on the door of the apartment screaming to see “Amy Kim.” So fervent was the man in his quest to find Amy that he was, remarkably, foaming from the mouth.</p>\n<p>Even after the officers contacted the 20-year-old, he refused to stop screaming. In an attempt to diffuse the situation, one of the deputies knocked on the door and asked the residents if they knew where Amy was. The slightly frightened tenants informed the deputy they had never heard of Amy Kim before.</p>\n<p>However, this new piece of information did not persuade the ranting drunk, who accused the apartment dwellers of hiding his precious Amy.</p>\n<p>Seeing no way to convince him otherwise, the deputies did what they do best: arrested him. They later transferred the dry-mouthed drunk to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-03-03/police-blotter-51/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-03-03/police-blotter-51/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-03-03/police-blotter-51/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-03-03/police-blotter-51/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-03-03/police-blotter-51/","id":3828,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3827,3826,3825],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
