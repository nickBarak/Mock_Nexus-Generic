Senate members and executive officers for next year. Both the new Senate and new executive board consist largely of Open People’s Party candidates, as all executives for the 2013-2014 school year are former O.P.P. candidates. Jonathan Abboud was sworn into the position of President, while Kyley Scarlet was sworn in as Internal Vice President and Alex Moore was sworn in as External Vice President of Local Affairs. Alex Choate officially took the seat of External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and Kristian Whittaker was sworn in as Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>In regards to executive reports, Haile spoke first and named specific entities and individual whom he said he was targeted and attacked by — including Rabbi Evan Goodman, President-elect Jonathan Abboud, Off-Campus Senator Alessandra Cianni and the <i>Daily Nexus,</i> amongst others.</p>\n<p>According to Haile, many of the allegations levied against him were a result of racial prejudice, particularly ones surrounding divestment meetings, in which he and other executives voiced their opinions. The Student Advocate General said he was accused by Rabbi Goodman of anti-Semitism, who Haile said ignored the similar opinions voiced by other speakers.</p>\n<p>“Given that the content of my speech was quite similar to at least 100 people who spoke during public forum, it’s interesting that the Rabbi chose to come after me and nobody else, at least to the extent that he did,” Haile said. “I believe race was a big factor in his treatment of me … I am an African man, a black man. I say that because the Rabbi knows nothing about me, aside from what I look like and what I said during public forum and my Exec report.”</p>\n<p>Haile also mentioned a <i>Daily Nexus</i> endorsement article for this year’s A.S. elections, which was published on April 22 and “called to question his ability to act as the nonpartisan resource that the OSA is expected to be.”</p>\n<p>“Given your history of publishing anti-Black Op-eds and other commentaries, I am not surprised,” Haile said. “I did not know racism and white supremacy were partisan issues for me to stay out of.”</p>\n<p>Later in the report, Haile highlighted “remarkable feats” met by the SAG Office during his term, describing his office as a “strong and beautiful team” that has counseled and assisted students through academic troubles, legal issues and housing issues, amongst other matters.</p>\n<p>“We helped and counseled hundreds of students regarding many issues they were struggling with ranging from being kicked out of school, cancellation of housing contracts, family problems, targeted treatment by police and much more,” Haile said.</p>\n<p>He also applauded the office’s participation in on-campus organizational efforts and its collaboration with the Black Student Union.</p>\n<p>Following Haile’s report was EVPSA Houssain’s speech, which was supportive of Haile’s statements and also said this school year included a number of positive efforts and changes.</p>\n<p>In his address, Houssain mentioned the success of passing Proposition 30, the record number of students registered to vote and a campaign addressing the corruption surrounding the prison industrial complex in California as some of the most successful accomplishments of his term.</p>\n<p>EVPLA Siordia spoke after Houssain and said there were over 30 initiatives launched through the EVPLA office this year. Siordia said his experience was rewarding, as it also helped him shape his sense of self.</p>\n<p>“How can I take one of the most cherished experiences of my life and describe it with words?” Siordia asked. “I truly feel like I’m losing the central and primary part of my identity. But even though this part of my life will no longer exist, I will still carry all of the incredible lessons that I’ve learned with me.”</p>\n<p>IVP Segovia spoke next, as she said her time in office allowed her to realize that she could not let others define her own personal identity.</p>\n<p>“You are your own worst enemy — the only person who knows you better than any one else ever will,” Segovia said. “You have the freedom to find yourself, think for yourself, and stay true to who you think you are.”</p>\n<p>Finally, President Armen delivered her executive report, also noting her negative experiences in A.S. She said she was unfairly attacked throughout her time at UCSB, and she urged listeners to treat each other with respect.</p>\n<p>“One of the most radical things that people can do is actually to have love in everything that they do,” Armen said. “I have, in the face of all of this, still shown love and respect and waved and smiled at every person that I met here, you know, and it’s been difficult. But, I have to say it’s all been working.”</p>\n<p>Armen said she did not believe political parties dominated A.S. but rather, that unhealthy power dynamics have weakened the organization.</p>\n<p>“While the party politics seem like the overrun A.S. — no,” Armen said. “We have power issues in this place that need to be addressed. We have one party that has won for six years 90 percent of the seats…If you want to look at things nationally, and you were to compare the systems, you would say there’s a problem, too.”</p>\n<p>Armen concluded her report with a spoken word piece that she wrote during her campaign for election last year. The piece focused on justice and humanity.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want no movement, if there ain’t no humanity,” Armen said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51559\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1608402219\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51558\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51559\" data-attachment-id=\"51559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/a-s-execs-give-reports-new-officers-sworn-in-2/senate_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369266755\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Abboud gets sworn in as the new  2013-2014 Associated Students President.

Since being elected into office, she attended the most recent UCSA meeting and officially launched her efforts to bring a UC Regent to campus.</p>\n<p>“I met with them one-on-one, and he said that he would be willing to come to campus and meet with students,” Choate said. “I have his contact information and I’ll be setting that up over summer, so we’ll be ready to go in fall.”</p>\n<p><strong><img data-attachment-id=\"51501\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-21/a-s-to-swear-in-next-years-executive-officers/kristian-whittaker/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristian-Whittaker.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"150,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kristian Whittaker\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristian-Whittaker.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristian-Whittaker.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-51501\" alt=\"Kristian Whittaker\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristian-Whittaker.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristian-Whittaker.jpg?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristian-Whittaker.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristian-Whittaker.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristian-Whittaker.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristian-Whittaker.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristian-Whittaker.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Student Advocate General – Kristian Whittaker </strong></p>\n<p>Student Advocate General-elect Kristian Whittaker plans to offer more precise definitions for the positions in his office, while striving to incorporate a wider range of perspectives to his team.Specifically, Whittaker will replace the current Housing and University divisions in the SAG Office with four new divisions: the Academic Division, Housing Division, Student Conduct Division and the Public Interest Division.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Whittaker offered some criticisms of current Student Advocate General Yoel Haile, noting that he would act more objectively than Haile.

Whittaker said he hopes to make the Office of the Student Advocate General more objective and neutral, and on the issue of diversity, he said the current office achieves “physical” diversity but lacks more “mental” diversity.

Several attendees spoke both in opposition and in support of the resolution, which requested that A.S. divest from companies, such as Hewlett-Packard, that “profit” from the “military occupation of Palestine.” The meeting also included resolutions aiming to condemn “Islamophobic hate speech” on campus.</p>\n<p>In regards to the resolution entitled “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid,” 11 senators voted against the resolution and 10 senators voted in support of it, while one senator abstained. The resolution, therefore, did not achieve the required two-thirds majority, and was not passed. The meeting adjourned at 7:55 a.m., after over 13 hours of deliberation.</p>\n<p>The aisle dividing the chairs into two seating sections at Corwin Pavilion marked a clear boundary between each side of the debate, with pro-divestment advocates on the left and anti-divestment advocates on the right. Participants demonstrated incredible passion throughout the entire meeting, as evidenced by the multiple instances of tense voices and tears.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Taryn Sanders preceded the debate with an appeal to the audience to remain respectful of the different perspectives.</p>\n<p>“I hope that we can … realize that there are passions on both sides of, in particular, the divestment issue — pro and con — and to address people in that way,” Sanders said. “Know that you’re not the only one that has passion about this. You’re not the only one that has an interest in this subject. In fact, there is another side to it, and to please see things from that side, and to address people in a mature way.”</p>\n<p>The meeting first began at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, marking the second meeting that included discussion of the divestment resolution. As the issue had already been discussed in much depth at last week’s meeting, speakers had the opportunity to reflect upon last week’s discussion and respond to some of the previous arguments. Adeel Lakhani, External Co-Chair at UCSB Academic Affairs Board, urged senators to be critical of the information being presented, such as when some speakers said Israel was not the only country in the region violating human rights.</p>\n<p>This second meeting also attracted many community members from outside of UCSB. The Santa Barbara chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace presented multiple speakers who, although personally identifying as Jewish, supported the divestment resolution. Rand Clark of Jewish Voice for Peace said being of the Jewish faith does not necessarily mean one is supportive of the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>“To be Jewish does not automatically make one a blind supporter of Israel — right or wrong,” Clark said. “A vote in favor of divestment says nothing about one’s attitude towards Jews … A little bit of discomfort is a small price to pay on the path to justice.”</p>\n<p>Anti-divestment speakers, however, vehemently denied that the divestment resolution would be a step toward justice. UCSB student Jonathan Lebo insisted the legislation would not encourage a peaceful solution.</p>\n<p>“The bill before you tonight is not about fostering peace,” Lebo said. “It will do nothing to end the centuries-old conflict between Jews and their Arab neighbors. The real [impact] of this bill is to deny the people of Israel the right to their homeland … The charges against Israel make no mention of the dire circumstances Israel faces.”</p>\n<p>Many anti-divestment speakers also questioned if Israel is actually breaking international law or committing human rights violations, as the resolution suggests.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, speakers representing both sides of the issue spoke about the effects the resolution would have on campus climate. Some anti-divestment speakers argued the divestment resolution was divisive and would hurt the general climate of UCSB, while some pro-divestment speakers argued it would actually unify the campus, as shown by the numerous student groups in support of its passage.</p>\n<p>Sabreen Shalabi of UC Irvine, who authored a similar resolution that passed unanimously at UCI, not only insisted campus climate at her school had not changed after passing the resolution, but also said past issues of similar importance have always faced such strong resistance.</p>\n<p>“The passing of the divestment resolution did not cause our campus to deteriorate in any way,” Shalabi said. “No issue is going to be agreed upon unanimously. No issue has ever been agreed upon unanimously … senators here today, sitting around, having this power to vote, this privilege to vote. Would you have voted for civil rights? Would you have voted to divest in Apartheid South Africa? That is the kind of decision that you are making today.”</p>\n<p>Despite such claims, many Jewish students said they felt campus climate had already changed. UCSB student Nathan Koreie felt so strongly about the degradation of the campus climate that he announced his official withdrawal from the university.</p>\n<p>“I was intimidated while in the A.S. Senate office. A student was spit on while on her way to class. Someone let the air out of my bike tires while at the A.S. Senate office, and a friend of mine was even denied service at the book store, all for opposing this resolution,” Koreie said. “As of this morning … I withdrew from UCSB … I genuinely feel like I have been left with no other choice.”</p>\n<p>First-hand accounts of life in Israel contradicted each other over whether or not Israel did engage in apartheid practices. Mohamed Hafez, a UCSB alumnus who spent time working for peace in the West Bank, insisted that citizens had different rights based on race. On the other hand, UCSB student Guy Singer, who lived in Israel for 11 years, insisted that Arab Israelis were not discriminated against, as there are Arab Israelis in positions of power and even Arab Israelis who are celebrities.</p>\n<p>Both parties called into question the reliability of sources being used for factual evidence, asserting bias within the sources. The integrity of many institutions was debated — including the United Nations, Amnesty International, the American government and others.</p>\n<p>At one point, the use of Miss Israel 2013’s African heritage to show Israel’s commitment to diversity elicited intensely critical responses. On-campus Senator Navkiran Kaur strongly opposed this example, explaining it to be offensive and an objectification of women of color.</p>\n<p>“I do not appreciate a woman of color’s body being objectified, or hyper-sexualized or tokenized in this space,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>In some final presentations regarding the resolution, both sides issued their opinions on the word apartheid itself. Anti-divestment representative Liran Braude, who has both lived in South Africa during apartheid and then in Israel as a soldier, disagreed with the word’s place in the legislation.</p>\n<p>“To compare [South Africa and Israel] is an insult of the highest order — not only to Jews and Israelis, but mostly to the black South Africans that actually suffered of apartheid,” Braude said.</p>\n<p>Hani Tajsar, student sponsor and representative of the pro-divestment stance, denied that naming Israel an apartheid state equated it to South Africa.</p>\n<p>“Apartheid does not mean that Israel is acting in the same way as South Africa,” Tajsar said. “South Africa and Israel have only one similarity: both were born out of imperialism and colonialism … As students at this university, we have a complicit involvement in the occupation of Palestine through our investments in these companies.”</p>\n<p>Katlen Abuata, Tajsar’s co-sponsor, added her own personal appeal to argument for divestment.</p>\n<p>“I do not want to pay into a system that has removed my father from his homeland,” Abuata said.</p>\n<p>Deliberation within the senate revisited many of the arguments that had already been introduced. Senators read different definitions of apartheid and debated whether or not voting on the bill was an act of neutrality and whether or not it would have tangible results in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>The student legislators also discussed the role of the investments in enabling human rights violations, and whether or not it was acceptable for student money to be funneled toward that cause. There was also debate over the intentions of the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and its connection with the resolution. After the deliberation, which included a long discussion on whether the resolution needed a simple majority or a two-thirds majority, the senators decided to cast a secret vote, which resulted in a defeat of the proposed resolution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"543296520\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50820\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50817\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/calpirg-protests-obamas-potential-student-loan-interest-rate-hike/divestment_tiana/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPhone 4S\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1365666521\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"4.28\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.05\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Divestment_Tiana\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50817\" alt=\"Divestment_Tiana\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>TIANA MILLER-LEONARD / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A.S.

In addition to several other items, the council also debated a renewed request to instate Human Rights Council as an A.S. entity and whether to pass a bill updating the A.S. Coastal Fund bylaws.</p>\n<p>First off, members heard concerns for UCSB’s queer population. Representatives and council members addressed reports of hate crimes committed against the university’s queer population over the weekend. On-Campus Representative Casey Capachi said these occurrences of hate crimes were unacceptable and called for A.S. to make a public display of support for the QSU.</p>\n<p>“We are going to show students that hate crimes are followed-up on by A.S. and taken very seriously by this community,” Capachi said.</p>\n<p>Following this, the council briefly debated a request from the Middle Eastern Cultural Club to reallocate funds to the club for its annual Middle Eastern Fair. After being informed by representatives of the club that the event was expected to draw thousands of participants, the council reallocated $1000 of unused A.S. funds to the group, $800 for food expenses and $200 to hire a belly dancer.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the council discussed a Coastal Fund bylaws bill for the first time since having tabled it two months ago. The bill’s text provided clarifications to the fund’s bylaws, with minor updates in most sections. At the fore of the bill’s requests was an addition to the fund’s bylaws to provide the Coastal Fund chair with a $350 quarterly honorarium.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Rep Stanley Tzankov said the council should pass the bill despite his previous qualms about the honorarium.</p>\n<p>“Originally I thought we should move it down to three hundred,” Tzankov said. “If the author for this bill thinks they should receive $350, [his or her request] takes precedence.”</p>\n<p>However, council members were not moot on this point. After deliberation, the amount of honorarium — or fiscal compensation — the Coastal Fund chair will receive per quarter was cut to $300 before the council passed the resolution.</p>\n<p>For the fourth consecutive council meeting, members considered a bill to instate the Human Rights Council — a student organization established under the Office of Student Life — as a formal A.S. entity. Off-Campus Rep Chloe Stryker and On-Campus Rep Jasmine Davenport said they had been amending the bill in collaboration with the HRC.</p>\n<p>Stryker said she was determined to have the council instated as an A.S. board.</p>\n<p>“By passing the bill, HRC will have a set budget for the years to come,” Stryker said. “We’ve talked about branching out to contain more of a worldview. It’s something that we don’t have in A.S., and I think it’s needed. If it does end up [lacking membership], then somebody can [remove it from] A.S. next year.”</p>\n<p>The council tabled the bill for another week to allow further drafting and deliberation.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22200\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/legislative-council-addresses-local-hate-speech/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22200\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/legislative-council-addresses-local-hate-speech/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/legislative-council-addresses-local-hate-speech/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/legislative-council-addresses-local-hate-speech/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-06/legislative-council-addresses-local-hate-speech/","id":3114,"author":{"id":221,"name":"Ali Limonadi"},"related":[3113,3112,3111],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
