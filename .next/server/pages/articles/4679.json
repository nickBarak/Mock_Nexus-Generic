A candlelight vigil was held at the church with speakers and live music in remembrance of the nine lives lost in the Charleston Shooting on June 17 and the six lives lost in I.V. in the events of May 23 last year. Guest speakers included state legislators, city officials and the parents of May 23 victims Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss.</p>\n<p>Richard Martinez, father of Christopher Michaels-Martinez and senior outreach associate for Everytown for Gun Safety, said 88 Americans are shot and killed every day with hundreds more wounded in homes, schools, churches, stores and streets.</p>\n<p>“Today we accept that gun violence can happen at any time, any place and to anyone in America,” Martinez said. “It happened to my family and it can happen to yours. I am here today for my son, Christopher, who was shot and killed near here just over a year ago.”</p>\n<p>Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America Team Leader Emily Heckman said the purpose of the Sunday’s event was to “lift each other up.”</p>\n<p>“We want to pray together for the safety of our children, for the sorrows and deep compassion for our community and for the wisdom and courage of our elected officials to take the next action,” Heckman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider said America’s collective inability to keep history from repeating itself is “disheartening.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen tragedy unfold again and again,” Schneider said. “The second amendment and common sense legislation that would have prevented a lot of these tragedies by stopping mentally ill and convicted criminals from accessing firearms are not mutually exclusive.”</p>\n<p>State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson said she remembers the assassinations of Former President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and has not seen significant improvement in gun regulation since.</p>\n<p>“This was decades ago,” Jackson said. “I am very old, and this problem is not getting better.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64216\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"896488250\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64225\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64216\" data-attachment-id=\"64216\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-29/walk-church-service-promote-anti-gun-violence-movement/charlestonwalk_by-lorenzo-basilio-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1435502118\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"95\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CharlestonWalk_by Lorenzo Basilio-15\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64216\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15-1024x684.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CharlestonWalk_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-15.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64216\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Jackson, acts of violence related to firearm use can be avoided.</p>\n<p>“We talk about mental illness, we talk about hate,” Jackson said. “These are things that live in all societies. But they don’t get to demonstrate themselves the way they do in our country because not everybody has access to a firearm just because they want one.”</p>\n<p>According to Assemblymember Das Williams, gun violence is one of the biggest causes of death among young people in America, behind car accidents and overdoses.</p>\n<p>“We need to, more than anything, keep ourselves and our society from complacency,” Williams said. “If we really want to keep our youth safe, we need to tackle the issues of gun violence.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said opponents to increased gun regulation told him background checks did not save his son.</p>\n<p>“Does that mean background checks are a failure and not worth doing? No,” Martinez said. “Seat belts in cars don’t prevent death from accidents 100 percent of the time, but that doesn’t mean we should stop using them. Seat belts save a significant number of lives … We need to improve California’s background check system to prevent the seriously mentally ill from having guns.”</p>\n<p>In the 17 states that require firearm background checks, 46 percent fewer women are shot and killed by their partners, 48 percent fewer on-duty police officers are shot and killed, 48 percent fewer people commit suicide with guns and there is 40 percent less gun trafficking, according to Schneider.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing society can do to reduce gun violence is to require a criminal background check on firearm sale,” Schneider said.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, individuals in opposition to gun regulation question why knives are not being focused on because three of the victims of the events of May 23 last year died of knife injuries. Martinez said a gun has “vastly” more power than any knife.</p>\n<p>“The handgun that killed Veronika Weiss could fire more than 40 bullets in one minute” Martinez said. “At the time the Isla Vista shooter died, he had more than 500 bullets left and his gun could fire as fast as he could pull the trigger.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he co-authored Assembly Bill (AB) 1014 with Assemblymember Nancy Skinner to allow for a Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) to be signed by a judge to temporarily prohibit a person from owning, purchasing or possessing firearms if the individual has been proven by law enforcement or a loved one to being a danger to themselves or others.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, we shouldn’t be having mentally unstable people having possession of firearms,” Williams said. “Laura’s law is a powerful tool about incorporating mental illness, and I’m pleased that Santa Barbara is looking into it.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she authored Senate Bill 347 which adds dealing in firearms without a license, petty theft involving a firearm, selling ammunition to someone under 21 and bringing or carrying ammunition onto school grounds to the existing list of misdemeanors prohibiting individuals from being able to purchase or possess a firearm for 10 years.</p>\n<p>“A number of crimes are associated with firearm-related misdemeanors,” Jackson said. “We know these people are more likely to use firearms and we know that we need to take those guns away from them moving forward.”</p>\n<p>Schneider said even though 94 percent of American citizens are in support of gun regulation, special interests groups such as the National Rifle Association (NRA) are still a big obstacle to passing gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“A large part of the problem is on the national level where special interests groups block any debate to keep politicians bound to some sense of ideological purity,” Schneider said. “When that happens our citizens are not served.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she believes the Charleston Shooting was clearly an act of hatred.</p>\n<p>“It is flamed by groups who unapologetically feel that they are the only ones who have truth and justice by their side,” Jackson said. “And we know they are wrong, and they should not be able to determine the fates of other people.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64213\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

Clinic Building to discuss Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) during the weekly stakeholders’ meeting.</p>\n<p>Williams proposed AB 3 in December to establish a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V., which, if passed, would tax residents using a Utility Users Tax (UUT) and would garner funds to improve public services in I.V., such as parking and lighting. UCSB Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow presented an update on the university’s position regarding the inclusion of the university in the CSD as outlined in AB 3. Local business owner Jay Freeman gave an hour-and-a hal- presentation on pressing issues in I.V., past attempts to incorporate I.V. into Goleta and Goleta’s cityhood process.</p>\n<p>Freeman said stakeholders should consider going through the LAFCO process to assess whether or not I.V. could become a CSD.</p>\n<p>Thurlow said UCSB is not opposed to a CSD, but does not want the university to be included within I.V.’s boundaries because of the unknown precedent it may set for the UC system.</p>\n<p>“The University of California has communicated with Assemblymember Williams’ office that, at this point, the university should not be in,” Thurlow said. “This does not mean we are opposed to AB 3, this does not mean we are opposed to self-government or any other measures, but because of the nature of what AB 3 is … nobody knows the implications.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, I.V.’s problems such as parking and lighting will not be immediately solved by the establishment of a CSD, as some students may believe.</p>\n<p>“The issues here just kind of stay, and I think it’s something we don’t spend enough time talking about, which is kind of the difference in mindset between students,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said there have been previous efforts to divert I.V. celebrations, such as Halloween, into more structured events.</p>\n<p>“In 2003 we actually had Dia de Los Muertos celebrations on October 31,” Freeman said. “I think it’s interesting that we were already having events on Halloween.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said the current LAFCO board should not be judged based on decisions made by boards in previous years since its members change every year.</p>\n<p>“If you really think that LAFCO in 2001 was a horrible, horrible thing, they’ve replaced their staff, and now have internal staff they don’t contract out anymore,” Freeman said. “All of the commissioners except these two, one of whom is in the room [Craig Geiser] and has been very friendly to us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Love held the I.V. Love and Remembrance Garden dedication ceremony for the six victims of the events of May 23 last year at a ceremony in the newly planted garden at People’s Park.</p>\n<p>UCSB administrators, students and Associated Students, county officials and representatives from participating organizations, such as Woodstock’s Pizza, Santa Barbara Forge + Iron and Seaborn Designs spoke at the event, officially opening the newly renovated park. The previous weekend, volunteers planted saplings and constructed a walking path through People’s Park around six benches with unique patterns representing the interests of each victim of the May 23 tragedy. Project I.V. Love founder and UCSB alumnus Jordan Killebrew, fourth-year art major Caila Baltas and fourth-year art major Jonathan Holcomb designed the benches and were present at the dedication.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said the garden is a “healing” place for the community to reflect on their memories of the victims.</p>\n<p>“This is a place where I think all of us can … sit here and connect with those precious lives, our friends, our fellow students who left us way too soon in their lives,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Killebrew said while the idea for the garden initially stemmed from his feelings of hopelessness following the tragedy, he appreciates the ability to honor the victims through the project.</p>\n<p>“It was way too close to home for me,” Killebrew said. “A year ago I would never have imagined this would happen and I’m just so happy that I have the opportunity to do something for the victims that we lost.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab instructor and spatial art professor Kim Yasuda said the circular design of the benches represents unity and “togetherness.”</p>\n<p>“The curves on the benches, if we were to put them in a circle, they form a perfect circle and the unity of those six students and imagining that for me is very, very comforting and very healing,” Yasuda said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Sam Spinner said he believes the memorial garden will have a lasting, positive impact on the community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great,” Spinner said. “I think we really needed something memorable for the next students to come here and realize how big of an impact this event made on us. It’s beautiful and all the benches are amazing.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year theater and film &amp; media studies double major Kirsten Nygaard said the garden is an important step towards the regrowth of I.V. after the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really wonderful that they were able to create something for the community to heal and to grow and to remember life and love,” Nygaard said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said I.V. is stronger and more united than she has ever seen it in her time as supervisor.</p>\n<p>“I am always proud to represent Isla Vista,” Farr said. “But in the seven years I have represented this community I have never been prouder of Isla Vista than I am at this moment.”</p><div

local charities, while supporting local businesses on June 1 by selling stickers at select locations around Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Stickers will be sold for $4, with $1.75 going to charities, $1.25 going to cover the cost of production and distribution and $1 going to the business that sells the sticker. Businesses selling the stickers include Otaco, Hana Kitchen, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ, Hempwise and Sorriso Italiano.</p>\n<p>Hana Kitchen and Otaco owner Weston Suh said he started this project to help raise money for local charities such as Adopt-A-Block and I.V. Youth Project. The campaign is intended to give residents a way to both show their I.V. pride and support local businesses and charities at the same time, according to Suh.</p>\n<p>“I love Isla Vista … and the students here are really proud of living in I.V. and they know they have something special,” Suh said. “As great as it is, I know it can be so much more … Everything takes money.”</p>\n<p>Local charities often struggle to secure funding for their projects, which makes it very difficult to focus on achieving their goals, according to Suh.</p>\n<p>“I.V. is not really a city — one of the minuses is that funding is always an issue,” Suh said. “A lot of organizations have to spend so much time running around trying to get funding that they can’t focus on their projects … it’s kind of a catch-22.”</p>\n<p>Suh said he hopes the stickers will be just the first part of the campaign and plans to expand it if students respond positively.</p>\n<p>“Right now, we just have bumper stickers, but hopefully we can expand to bigger things and raise tens of thousands of dollars,” said Suh. “That’s really the goal … There’s a lot we can do.”</p>\n<p>According to Suh, Adopt-A-Block and I.V. Youth Project are the first charities that he hopes to work with, and more will follow as the program expands.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/sticker-sales-to-support-local-charities-businesses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/sticker-sales-to-support-local-charities-businesses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/sticker-sales-to-support-local-charities-businesses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/sticker-sales-to-support-local-charities-businesses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/sticker-sales-to-support-local-charities-businesses/","id":4678,"author":{"id":139,"name":"Emile Nelson"},"related":[4677,4676,4675],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
