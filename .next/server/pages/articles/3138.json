Food Bank.</p>\n<p>In explaining the California State Budget’s impact on the education system, third-year student Ajinkya Joshi discussed Governor Jerry Brown’s priorities in educational funding and also said tuition costs are expected to remain unchanged in the upcoming years.</p>\n<p>“He’s going to focus on making a five percent increase in the general fund to schools and higher education,” Joshi said. “Essentially, our tuition won’t be increasing; it will be stable, and the UCs and CSUs are going to be aiming to try to increase innovation and trying to make it so that way more of us graduate at a lower cost.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Joshi said the current problems in higher education are that the UCs have a higher cost structure and higher per student subsidy.</p>\n<p>“Right now the problem is trying to maintain the quality of education while keeping the costs low for the student,” Joshi said.</p>\n<p>Although Joshi’s presentation covered a fairly large quantity of information that would directly impact UCSB students, Senators came close to denying Joshi sufficient time to make the presentation. The vote on granting Joshi his requested 10 minutes of extra time turned out to be a tie until Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet broke it with a vote in favor of the time extension.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore spoke briefly on plans for Deltopia, the annual student-organized event coming up this Spring Quarter, regarding efforts to provide extra police units, Port-a-Potties and access to drinking water during the festivities. Moore said he will advocate for a similar system established during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“What I want to do is an expanded version of what we did for Halloween,” Moore said. “We’ll have a hydration station and some sort of safety effort as well.”</p>\n<p>Chair of A.S. Food Bank and third-year economics and accounting major Erick Lankey reported on a series of upcoming events geared toward enhancing student involvement and knowledge about the Food Bank. According to Lankey, these events include “how to eat on a low budget” tours through the I.V. Food Co-op, an extreme couponing team contest and a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program challenge in which participants pledge to live on $31.50 of food for a week in an effort to gain empathy for the challenges faced by individuals living on food stamps.</p>\n<p>The presentation received positive feedback from Off-Campus Senators Andre Taylor and Nick Onyshko. Taylor said he was “very excited” to participate, and Onyshko said he applauds the Food Bank for its growth as an organization.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to say all this stuff sounds amazing, and I’m really impressed with everything you’ve done with this committee,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>Bills passed during the meeting included a bill to update Take Back the Night’s legal code as well as another bill that limits the amount of money campus BCCs spend on food per quarter to $500 or less, depending on the size of the particular BCC, as part of an effort to reduce wasteful spending. A bill to establish a new A.S. logo was tabled for another week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/","id":3138,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3137,3136,3135],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson","biography":"Not available","articles":[2784,2815,2930,3003,3007,3009,3016,3018,3024,3041,3046,3052,3062,3064,3065,3124,3138,3493,3622,5935],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Extravaganza Restricted To Campus, Kept Private Event","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Program Board will keep the Extravaganza music festival local this year by banning all non-UCSB attendees.

While ASPB plans to release this year’s lineup in about two weeks, hip hop artist Cee Lo Green announced earlier this month on his website he would be performing at the festival.</p>\n<p>Special Events Coordinator Ali Abbas, a third-year political science major, said the theme of this year’s concert is “your fees, your festival.”</p>\n<p>“The fact that we are not allowing out-of-towners will mean a better experience for the students,” Abbas said. “They are really our priority.”</p>\n<p>ASPB Commissioner Rae Yamamoto, a fourth-year black studies and art history major, said this year’s changes directly address student complaints.</p>\n<p>“After last year’s Extravaganza, Program Board received many complaints about the lines, the crowd and overall safety of the event,” Yamamoto said in an e-mail. “To remedy the students’ issues, we changed our policies.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College second-year Anne Gumina said the event’s exclusivity spares her from suffering through a potentially disappointing lineup.</p>\n<p>“I chose not to see [Cee Lo Green] at Coachella and I would choose not to see him at Extravaganza,” Gumina said. “Cee Lo Green … more like go ‘Cee’ Al Green, ‘cause he’s better, and you really can’t make sincere love to ‘Fuck You.’”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_36991\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">[media-credit name=”Daily Nexus File Photo” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1512718368\" data-slb-group=\"36989\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-36991\" data-attachment-id=\"36991\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/extravaganza-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=1808%2C971&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1808,971\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"extravaganza\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=888%2C476&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-36991\" title=\"extravaganza\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza-250x134.jpg?resize=250%2C134\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"134\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?resize=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?resize=1024%2C549&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?w=1808&amp;ssl=1 1808w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-36991\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Previous Extravaganza artists include Ludacris, Rebelution, Edward Sharpe &amp; the Magnetic Zeros and Girl Talk.

Yamamoto said ASPB hopes this year’s modifications will make the day more enjoyable for UCSB students.\n<p>“Many students complained about the lines, having to wait hours just to get into the festival,” Yamamoto said. “By limiting the festival to UCSB only, we hope to create a more efficient system of entry.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Yamamoto said last year’s crowds caused several safety hazards for attendees and put dangerous stress on the area’s emergency services.</p>\n<p>“Last year, there were no ambulances available in the county for two hours because they were all at Extravaganza to aid the concert-goers,” Yamamoto said. “Most who were in need of paramedic assistance were out-of-towners.”</p>\n<p>Despite the exclusivity of this year’s festival, Abbas said he encourages the public to attend ASPB’s many other open performances.</p>\n<p>“We’re sorry that community members can’t participate in this event, but we have many other concerts and events that are open to the public,” Abbas said.</p>\n<p>ASPB helped coordinate the upcoming Chilla Vista festival, a showcase of local music and art which will be held in Ansiq’ Oyo’ Park on May 1 at noon.</p>\n<p>Yamamoto said the future of Extravaganza is yet to be determined pending students’ reaction to this year’s festival.</p>\n<p>“I think any changes made will be determined after we see how this year goes,” Yamamoto said.</p>\n<p>Students, faculty and staff members will be required to present an ACCESS card to enter the festival.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/","id":3135,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3134,3133,3132],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Current Council Convenes for Last Spring Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council instated an expansion of the A.S.

Emergency Loan program during last night’s final meeting before government turnovers.</p>\n<p>The council officially placed the newly created UCSB Community Financial Fund — a student loan program approved as a new fee during this year’s Spring Elections — into the association’s by-laws. Additionally, the council approved a request of $459 to fund a week-long advertisement in the Santa Barbara Independent publicizing the May 26 event “The Alternative: Bringing Power to Our Voices,” which will take place during College Republicans’  David Horowitz lecture.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the event aims to appease students concerned about the controversial message behind Horowitz’s speech.</p>\n<p>“He has decades of experience of twisting your words and forcing you to say something,” Tzankov said. “It’s just not a healthy space for dialogue. We didn’t want to work in his space but created an alternative event where we will have a healthy space for dialogue.”</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joe Lee, however, said scheduling the speeches at separate times would allow students to attend both lectures and provide more balanced arguments.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be effective if you see the event first and have a reactive event to that,” Lee said. “We don’t know what’s going to be happening there. Maybe if you have it before or after, students who are attending David Horowitz will have an opportunity to attend this event.”</p>\n<p>Despite Lee’s suggestion the forum was not rescheduled and is slated to take place during Horowitz’s speech.</p>\n<p>The council also discussed a Bill to Restructure Queer Commission that proposed additional unfunded positions on the committee to further gender education efforts on campus.</p>\n<p>University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid said the legislation would provide vital resources to ensure equality on campus.</p>\n<p>“We created the first Queer Alumni Network, which is a branch of the Alumni Association, specifically for queer alumni,” Del Cid said. “We’re just making sure that’s established and institutionalized within the positions so it can sustain itself. This also creates a position for transfer students as a way for someone who’s new to the community to get involved.”</p>\n<p>However, a significant amount of debate arose over the intricacies of the bill’s language including references to the gender identity “genderfuck.”</p>\n<p>As of press time, the council tabled the bill until after discussions on old business, leaving the genderfuck issue unresolved.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38464\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38464\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/","id":3136,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3135,3134,3133],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Extravaganza Brings Rusko, Cee Lo to SB","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Thousands of UCSB students, faculty and staff piled into Harder Stadium yesterday for Associated Students Program Board’s annual Extravaganza music festival.

For the first time, A.S. Program Board required attendees to present an ACCESS card to gain entrance, making the event exclusive to the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>The change was met with mixed feelings from students but many agreed that wait times were significantly reduced.</p>\n<p>Yasmin Sharawy, a second-year biology major, said she saw a marked difference in lines between this and last year’s events.</p>\n<p>“Last year it took us two hours to get in,” Sharawy said. “This year it took us two minutes.”</p>\n<p>Second-year linguistics major Dana Fallon said while she was disappointed that visitors were not welcome, the change positively influenced crowd management at the historically hectic happening.</p>\n<p>“My friend from out of town came last year,” Fallon said. “It’s too bad she couldn’t come this year, but it was overall a lot faster and it’s more fun with only UCSB students.”</p>\n<p>Local band Sprout, winner of this year’s Battle of the Bands, kicked off the event after gates opened at 1 p.m. Michael Wagman, an undeclared second-year, said the act set a good tone for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>“Sprout was great,” Wagman said. “We got here 15 minutes after it opened and saw the openers. The djembe player was amazing and fine.”</p>\n<p>The next act, Santa Cruz-based ska group The Expendables, received similar praise for their diverse tunes, which incorporated styles spanning from punk rock to reggae. Sharawy said the set proved enjoyable to everyone from diehard fans to first-time listeners.</p>\n<p>“I hadn’t heard of them until now,” Sharawy said. “But they’re really good live.”</p>\n<p>Rapper Talib Kweli took the stage next, performing a diverse selection of tunes with music by other artists such as The Beatles mixed into his own songs. During his set, Kweli reprimanded Fox News for calling rapper Common “vile” and denounced the channel by calling it an entertainment source lacking in real news value.</p>\n<p>English DJ Rusko followed with an hour of dubstep that set off a massive wave of dancing within the crowd but was nonetheless met with mixed reactions. Uce Nnadi, a second-year political science major, said the DJ gave a quality performance.</p>\n<p>“He came and delivered,” Nnadi said. “It was dubstep in its purest.”</p>\n<p>However, third-year mathematics major Eric Frydendal was not as impressed with the artist’s spins.</p>\n<p>“I’m too sober for this shit,” Frydendal said.</p>\n<p>Headliner Cee Lo Green then took the stage, opening with a rendition of Black Sabbath’s “Crazy Train.” The Gnarls Barkley singer covered various other rock songs before unveiling his former band’s top single “Crazy” and his own recent chart-topper “Fuck You.” Green closed the set with a rendition of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing” to end the festival.</p>\n<p>Sharawy said the artist’s performance was an improvement in entertainment from previous years.</p>\n<p>“He started off slow, but it got really good at the end because we knew the songs,” Sharawy said. “It was way better this year. He was a way better headliner than Drake. He tried to please the crowd while Drake didn’t.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38843\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38843\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/","id":3137,"author":{"id":214,"name":"Mackensie Minniear"},"related":[3136,3135,3134],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
