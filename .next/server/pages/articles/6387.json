It’s a Saturday night, and you head over to a DIY band show in your friend’s garage. You meet up with some buds who are all wearing typical indie scene ’fits, complete with flannels and baggy cuffed pants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s this cute guy across the garage, who clearly thinks that making eye contact with you twice counts as shooting his shot. You decide to play along, though, as he makes his way over to you through the crowd. He reaches one of your friends and starts talking to them about the class they had together last quarter. Your friends see the way you’re both ogling each other, so they leave you to get to talking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He’s cute and funny and charming. You laugh as he tries to flex the fact that his roommate is the drummer in the band. He suggestively compliments the little flower that is painted onto your back pant pocket. The band starts to play “Isla Vista” for the third time, but you’re dancing with him and feeling it. You catch your friends giving you a thumbs up out of the corner of your eye.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As midnight nears, you walk in the street with him as he suggests that you could come back to his place, which is a block or two away. He plays it off as if he simply doesn’t want you to have to walk all the way home. You don’t mind even a little bit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He lives in a house with all male roommates, who look at you with jealousy as their boy brings you back to his room. Everything feels exciting and spontaneous, and you know exactly where this night is headed. It feels good to be intoxicated and sweaty and wanted for the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s this awkward moment, as you both sit on his bed, but he quickly asks if he can kiss you and you say yes. The next moment you’re tangled up in his sheets, while he’s kissing you hot and heavy. Even though he tastes like cigarettes and bad beer, he’s still a good kisser. As the make-out session really ramps up, the clothes come off, and he’s consistently asking if you’re okay at every step.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then all of a sudden, he puts his hand around your neck and starts to squeeze. You open your eyes immediately because you’re so caught off guard. You’re not sure if he can feel the fact that you froze, but he eventually takes his hand off your neck. Throughout the night, he hadn’t given you any reason to think he would be “that guy,” as he asked for consent religiously. But in that moment, you’re rightfully afraid and scared for your safety</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Choking can be a nice form of breath play that really spices up a sexual encounter, but it should happen with clear and informed consent.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, I thought encounters like these were one-off experiences and I felt responsible for getting myself into these situations. My internal slut-shaming voice chimed in to remind me that I deserved this for how free and casual I was about going home with this guy. Back in the guy’s room, I dismissed the terror I felt, justifying it by telling myself that it was fine because choking has become such a common kink, and he had been respectful during the lead up to that act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually I opened up to my friends about the several times that I have experienced this, and, unfortunately, they echoed my sentiment, saying that they had also experienced people choking them during first-time casual hookups. When I was removed from the heat of the moment, it struck me how truly messed up it is that we’ve had virtual strangers perform such a violent act without any consent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond how incredibly violated I felt, choking can also be really dangerous for people with any sort of breathing or heart problems, especially when it’s so unexpectedly coming from some dude you just met. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to be clear that I’m not trying to kink shame anyone. I like being choked just as much as the next slightly submissive kinkster. But you’re engaging in a really scary and vulnerable act when you allow yourself to be choked. I’m not going to trust just anyone to physically take away my blood or air supply, especially when I literally just met them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choking can be a nice form of breath play that really spices up a sexual encounter, but it should happen with clear and informed consent. I’ve had much better sexual encounters where a guy has put his hand gently on my neck and asked if that was okay. Although this consent is required, it felt really comfortable and excited for someone to respect me in the way I deserve to be respected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as consent needs to be considered at every level of a sexual escapade, choking should be thought of as an act that requires explicit consent. It’s surprisingly easy to get consent and ensure that everyone leaves feeling safe and sexy. Politely asking for that permission doesn’t ruin the power dynamics inherent to choking. Instead, it shows that you are deserving of having that person submit to you in that way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time you want to get a little kinky with someone you’ve just met remember that choking shouldn’t be taken so lightly and, most importantly, it requires thorough consent. Or better yet, maybe wait for you and your partner to have a little more experience together before pulling the, “Choke me, Daddy” bit.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eloise Scott keeps her standards low but not when it comes to her sexual safety.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88982\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-12/dont-choke-me-daddy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88982\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-12/dont-choke-me-daddy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-12/dont-choke-me-daddy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-12/dont-choke-me-daddy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-12/dont-choke-me-daddy/","id":6387,"author":{"id":783,"name":"Eloise Scott"},"related":[6386,6385,6384],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":783,"name":"Eloise Scott","biography":"Not available","articles":[6387],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Why Does Birth Control Always Feel Like a Battlefield?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2019-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/male-birth-contol-art-e1559019781214.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/male-birth-contol-art-e1559019781214.png?resize=650%2C621&ssl=1","description":"Cardi Bradshaw sets the record straight on misconceptions about birth control.

But when it comes to pregnancy, cisgender men don’t worry about contraceptives the same way that people who can get pregnant do, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and it’s not their fault. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But do they know what we’re up against?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many forms of </span><a href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm#what_is_birth_control_and_how_does_it_work\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">birth control</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and because it’s no longer a taboo conversation hiding in your doctor’s contraceptive pamphlet, let’s talk about it!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the testimonies of my fellow Gaucho comrades, our frontline contraceptive soldiers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— we honor your legacy:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went on birth control when I was 16. Within five minutes of my first pill I started bleeding, and it went on for weeks. I decided to switch to an IUD , which got dislodged, after a year of consistent bleeding. So now I’m back on the pill with the original problems I had. People say to just stick to condoms, but without the pill I still get my period for two weeks every month and major PMS. Also, condoms aren’t as reliable and not always available on hand. I didn’t want the [birth control] shot because it would make me gain weight, and the ring is difficult to manage. I hate it all.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If men could get pregnant, birth control would be as available as your nearest Starbucks.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was 17 and was prescribed the lowest dosage of estrogen to regulate my period. Within the first two weeks, I was crying almost every day for no reason. By the third week my boobs had went from a B to a D and hurt like hell. I felt angry and anxious, and by the fourth week I thought I was going crazy. When I went back to CVS to pick up the next month’s prescription, the pharmacist apologized for ‘giving me the wrong prescription last month’… Instead of getting my low-estrogen pill that my doctor prescribed me, I was given a form that had weekly </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increases in estrogen </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and literally wrecked my physical and mental state. This was my introduction to birth control.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I got the implant last year when I was 19. It made me so depressed for no reason. I was extremely unhappy and I didn’t know why. I actually had to take my Spring Quarter off and go home because of how depressed I was. As soon as I got the implant removed I was fine … same thing happened to my best friend who also had the implant.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Birth control is important, and it</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> privilege</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to a </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db327.htm\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Center for Health Statistics </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “approximately 65% of women are using some type of contraceptive method.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than half of the female-identifying population is on some form of birth control. People who bear the burden of childbearing also bear the burden of preventing that. We can’t blame the people we know for not having to deal with getting pregnant. But considering the gender roles of contraception, my friend’s dad put it best: “If [cis] men could get pregnant, birth control would be as available as your nearest Starbucks.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardi Bradshaw wants male Gauchos to consider the trials and tribulations of birth control and to buy more condoms. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/why-does-birth-control-always-feel-like-a-battlefield/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/why-does-birth-control-always-feel-like-a-battlefield/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/why-does-birth-control-always-feel-like-a-battlefield/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/why-does-birth-control-always-feel-like-a-battlefield/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/why-does-birth-control-always-feel-like-a-battlefield/","id":6384,"author":{"id":781,"name":"Cardi Bradshaw"},"related":[6383,6382,6381],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Great Sexpectations","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2019-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tinna-lam-sexpectations.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tinna-lam-sexpectations.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Max Hampton issues an important reminder that consent is always sexy!

Nonetheless, you’ve got some great sexpectations on your hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In situations like these, I normally uncomfortably laugh and go hide in my bathroom, but I realize that’s not exactly socially acceptable, so I reached out to two other Gauchos to get their advice.

I would’ve tried to leave, but he was my ride home, and when we pulled up next to my house he stopped the car and I could tell he kind of wanted to say something.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was about to break the silence and he reached over and grabbed my boob out of my bra, so I was just sitting there with one boob hanging out of my T-shirt. After that I just kind of scooped my boob back in and skirted out of there. My advice would be to make sure that your date respects your boobs’ dignity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your date isn’t quite so invasive and you feel like you can just talk your way out of it, don’t you worry — I spoke to another anonymous Gaucho who has just the excuse you’ve been looking for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I had this cuddle buddy last year that I knew from back home. I made it clear that he was just a cuddle buddy, too, to avoid confusion. The last time I saw him was when I invited him to my room to cuddle. He started making moves and I wasn’t into it. Then he tried undoing my belt and said, ‘I wanna see your vagina.’”</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB is a very sexually liberated campus, sex is always subject to consent and respect; it’s not something you can buy with a shot of Kirkland vodka or expect after a set number of dates (I know sharing nachos is an intimate experience, but please be a consensual Casanova).</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To that I brushed his hands away and got up quickly as I said I was on my period and was super heavy.

Up until this point, the only definition of consent that I had ever heard was always “no means no.” Every conversation about consent seemed to end with this succinct summation.  But as a teenager navigating the complicated process of growing up, I learned that saying “no” is a lot easier said than done. A “no” does not always look or sound like someone simply saying “no.” Sometimes a “no” is silence. Sometimes a “no” is fear. Sometimes a “no” is a series of no’s that ended with a “fine.” I knew what consent was, but it was still hard to know whether or not I was truly giving it, because while I wasn’t saying no, I wasn’t exactly saying “yes” either. What I learned that day in class was that consent isn’t about saying “no,” it’s about saying “yes.” That day had a huge impact on how I view consent even now. And while I was so grateful to have had that education, I couldn’t help but wonder, what took so long? </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86872\" style=\"width: 342px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86872\" data-attachment-id=\"86872\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/consent-lauren-orris/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?fit=1660%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1660,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"consent : lauren orris\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?fit=203%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?fit=830%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86872\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris-203x250.jpg?resize=332%2C409\" alt=\"\" width=\"332\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?resize=203%2C250&amp;ssl=1 203w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?resize=768%2C948&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?resize=830%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 830w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consent-lauren-orris.jpg?w=1660&amp;ssl=1 1660w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86872\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lauren Orris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until recently, there hasn’t been much legislation surrounding consent. Federally, rape is illegal, and rape is defined as penetration without the consent of the victim. So while we have a definition of rape, we also need a definition of consent. This is where it gets dicey. Consent is defined differently in every U.S. state, but overall, each definition can be summed up as “no means no.” This changed in California in 2014 when </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB967\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill No. 967</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (codified as Section 67386 of the California Education Code) was signed into law. This law requires public schools to adopt policies and develop curriculum around affirmative consent in order to receive state funding. It’s affirmative: this law changed the definition of consent. Without affirmative consent there is pressure on the victim to resist, but sex should never involve resistance. The idea is that if someone wants to have sex, they will tell you, and before that happens, keep your hands to yourself. Consent is not the absence of a “no,” but the presence of a “yes.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That brings us back to my senior year in a California public high school, and finally feeling like I just might understand what it means to actually say “yes.” But I don’t think we should wait until kids are having sex to talk to them about consent. Consent is a conversation that should start as soon as we can walk. Deciding who can touch your body and how does not always have to do with sex—it has do with choice and respect. Consent is not inherently sexual, and we have to stop treating it like it is. If consent was something we taught as early as pre-school, maybe kids would grow up into adults who understand what it means to ask for and to give consent. Luckily, some schools in the United States are doing just that. At </span><a href=\"http://www.lone-tree.k12.ia.us/video\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lone Tree Elementary</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Iowa, they teach students consent in one of the simplest of ways: saying hello. Every morning the pre-schoolers greet each other and the kids may choose between a hug, a handshake, a high five, or a fistbump. This practice was originally put in place to encourage positive interactions between the students, but on a larger scale it teaches children to not only seek permission before touching someone, but also that it is okay to be explicit about what they want for themselves as well, even if it’s only the difference between a hug or a handshake. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might seem intuitive to establish consent between peers or strangers, I’d like to take it a step further and argue that it should be established between family members as well. It is often expected that young children hug or kiss grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. Of course, I think this is wonderful, but it is not uncommon for young children to resist or be uncomfortable with forced contact. I was certainly a stubborn child once who didn’t want to kiss my relatives, but eventually, I learned it was something that you just have to do, even if you don’t always want to. But by forcing even these most innocent interactions, it teaches children that they should do what is asked of them and their bodies, even if it makes them uncomfortable. It’s an act of assumption and it teaches a code of putting other people’s desires before your own. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that kids should never be encouraged to show physical affection to family members, but I am saying that even the small act of asking for consent (and respecting the answer) before hugging a child could have a long-term impact in teaching them what consent looks and feels like.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consent is a conversation that should start as soon as we can walk.

With movements like </span><a href=\"https://metoomvmt.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MeToo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there is a long overdue dialogue starting about what it means to truly say “yes.” I want to take it further and make it a conversation that isn’t just about sex, and isn’t just for teenagers and college students. Growing up, I found consent complicated, but it shouldn’t be. Perhaps if we grow up learning to respect one another and ourselves—by seeing and practicing affirmative consent in all facets of touch—then “yes means yes” could just be common sense and decency, rather than a complicated piece of legislation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, </span><a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/college-sexual-assault\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in five women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will experience sexual assault in college. Based on the women I know in college, that number is much higher. This number only represents those who report, but think about how many don’t. For their own reasons—whether it’s fear, embarrassment, or not even realizing they were assaulted in the first place—so many stay silent. I have left sexual interactions feeling ashamed or hurt, but I couldn’t understand why. I never said no, after all. Sometimes it takes time (and really good friends) to recognize sexual assault when it happens, and that’s why we need to talk about it.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consent wasn’t really a conversation in my life until late into high school, and even then, it was always in classes, and certainly never anything that was talked about within my family. It’s time to start having these conversations, because no one should ever touch or be touched without consent, and only “yes” can mean “yes.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juliet Carter wants to talk about consent.  </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86871\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86871\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-17/its-affirmative-yes-means-yes/","id":6386,"author":{"id":780,"name":"Juliet Carter"},"related":[6385,6384,6383],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
