My eyes jumped to the blue lights on the stage and quickly skimmed the rows for an open seat.</p>\n<p>The lecture hall quickly reached max capacity, and people were redirected to Buchanan to watch a live stream of the lecture done by Bryan Stevenson, an extremely influential and inspirational lawyer who spends his life working to bring justice to those least likely to receive it. He founded the Equal Justice Initiative to defend the poor and has spent a lot of time working with clients on death row. He is also the author of <em>Just Mercy</em>, this year’s UCSB Reads book.</p>\n<p>The excitement and anticipation in the air were tangible, much louder in presence than the jazz music playing as people filed into their seats.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Stevenson’s signature quote, “The opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justice,” was scrawled across the lecture screen next to a picture of a shattered blue ceramic mockingbird. The University librarian spoke, and then came the moment everyone was waiting for: Bryan Stevenson came out on stage.</p>\n<p>Stevenson said he wanted to talk about how he thinks we can change the world. He went on to explain the current prison and incarceration statistics, finishing with the daunting statistic that said one in three black baby boys born in the U.S. would go to jail in his lifetime.</p>\n<p>The first thing he said we could do to change the world is get proximate to poverty in the community. He said that you cannot change the world from a distance, and only in proximity will you find power.</p>\n<p>As Stevenson’s speech grew more fervent with emotion, the crowd responded more enthusiastically and dramatically to his remarks. People called out praise to him and were in agreement with his words.</p>\n<p>The next thing he said that we could do to change the world is change the narratives. He argued that we need to change these narratives in order to change the problems that they cause. He said we especially need to change the narrative of racism in this country. We need to confront the fact that our history is rooted in genocide and do what we must as a country to heal from that.</p>\n<p>He made a dramatic claim that as the Germans had marked the locations of the Holocaust in respect, we should mark the spots of lynching in this country so the ghosts of racism are visible to us.</p>\n<p>The third thing he said we could do to change the world is be hopeful. Hope is essential to change the world. Losing hope is what condemns us to remain where we are.</p>\n<p>Fourth and finally, he said we must be willing to do uncomfortable things. Many times his job has put him in pain or made him uncomfortable, but he persevered. He has realized that the reason why he does what he does it because he is a broken person; he works for broken people, and yet he is broken himself. Sometimes being broken gives us the edge we need to fight back.</p>\n<p>He finished off his inspiring speech by saying that we should never doubt our capacity to change the world; neither our grades nor our income represent a measure of our capacity to bring about change. Our capacity to change the world is measured by our willingness to do the things that have to be done.</p>\n<p>Many people stood to ask him questions. A student spoke of how he was moved to tears more by Bryan Stevenson than by the death of his family; people stood to talk of their hardships or to question the hypocrisy of the UC system in working with Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p>When he finished speaking, there was an awe-filled moment of silence before the massive crowd rose as one in a thunderous standing ovation.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70525\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-29/bryan-stevenson-brings-more-than-just-mercy-to-campbell/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70525\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-29/bryan-stevenson-brings-more-than-just-mercy-to-campbell/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-29/bryan-stevenson-brings-more-than-just-mercy-to-campbell/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-29/bryan-stevenson-brings-more-than-just-mercy-to-campbell/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-29/bryan-stevenson-brings-more-than-just-mercy-to-campbell/","id":6946,"author":{"id":121,"name":"Dakota Maxwell"},"related":[6945,6944,6943],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":121,"name":"Dakota Maxwell","biography":"Not available","articles":[2502,6946],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Playboi Carti Set to Headline Extravaganza 2019","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Previews: What's Going On","publish_date":"2019-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-e1463653993701.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-e1463653993701.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"Playboi Carti and Aminé are among an eclectic mix of artists slated to perform at Extravaganza 2019 this Sunday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S.

The band has broken past the realm of YouTube with the release of their 2018 album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being So Normal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Known for their soft and slow hits “Peach Pit” and “Alrighty Aphrodite,” the band features euphonious guitar solos and metaphorical lyrics that create a unique sound differentiating the group from their indie contemporaries. From quitting minimum-wage jobs to joining the lineup for Tennessee’s Bonnaroo festival, the gentlemen of Peach Pit will surely ignite the music scene in the near future. Peach Pit is the perfect ending to a spring day at UCSB, gracing the stage with a qwarkly, hipster aesthetic and stealing the hearts of alternative enthusiasts everywhere.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><b>Deorro</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Widely known for his single “Five More Hours,” deejay Deorro is set to perform at Harder Stadium this year. Deorro was born in Los Angeles and started his music career at the age of 14. His rising popularity over the past two years has been in part due to deserved support from collaboration with heavy-hitting artists such as Steve Aoki, Diplo and Carnage. Deorro has attracted an unwaveringly loyal fanbase, known as “PandaFam” — a strong testament to his musical craftsmanship. His newest single, “Keep It Goin,’” features Danny Avila and is distinctly fast-paced, involving dramatic buildups and drops. His Latin-themed songs like “Bailar” are festive and exciting as well. Whether or not you are a long-standing Deorro fan, his music is sure to get you moving. Offering a blend of both quick, hard drops alongside more melodic and danceable rhythms, his deejay set is sure to complement the rap headliners of this year’s Extravaganza. </span></p>\n<p><b>Empress Of</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lorely Rodriguez, better known as Empress Of, is making an appearance at this year’s Extravaganza. As an American singer/songwriter who has made a name in the indie music industry since 2012, her electric pop style incorporates notes of contemporary R&amp;B. Along with her popular feature with Khalid on DJDS’s song “Why Don’t You Come On,” Empress Of also appeared in Lana Del Rey’s album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and reached the top 10 on Billboard charts in September of 2015. With her recently released album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I’m With Him</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Empress Of has garnered a loyal fanbase on platforms such as YouTube and Spotify. </span></p>\n<p><b>Aminé</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portland rapper Aminé, born Adam Aminé Daniel, made waves within the hip-hop community with the release of his debut single, “Caroline,” in 2016. This record, which peaked at No. 11 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, was commended by critics and fans alike for its witty lyricism and uniquely eccentric production, and it went on to become one of the defining tracks of the year. Aminé’s second viral hit, “REDMERCEDES,” is remembered for its controversial music video, in which the rapper uses whiteface as he satirizes racial stereotypes prevalent within the hip-hop community and across the nation. His debut album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good For You</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, garnered a largely positive response and introduced him to a much more diverse fanbase, as his music was compared to that of the likes of Missy Elliott and Lil Yachty. Aminé’s sophomore project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ONEPOINTFIVE</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was released last August. The rapper recently wrapped the European leg of his tour in support of the album and is scheduled to play several festivals in the U.S. and Europe this summer. </span></p>\n<p><b>Playboi Carti</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of the pioneers of the next generation of hip-hop, Atlanta-based rapper Playboi Carti continues to forge his own path and defy the conventions set by those before him. His musical style relies less on elaborate lyricism and more on catchy flows and production. After generating much hype and anticipation amongst his fanbase, Carti’s eponymous debut mixtape was released in April 2017 and spawned hit tracks such as “wokeuplikethis*” and “Magnolia.” \\That same year, Carti was named in</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> XXL Magazine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s prestigious Freshman Class list, which is credited with catapulting the careers of many up-and-coming rappers. Last May, Carti released his first studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Die Lit</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which debuted at No. 3 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. The project garnered largely positive reviews from critics, with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pitchfork Magazine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> labeling it as an “album that works almost completely from its own lunatic script.” Carti is set to perform at the Governors Ball Music Festival next month and will join fellow rapper Wiz Khalifa as a special guest on tour this summer. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-13/playboi-carti-and-amine-set-to-headline-extravaganza-2019/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-13/playboi-carti-and-amine-set-to-headline-extravaganza-2019/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-13/playboi-carti-and-amine-set-to-headline-extravaganza-2019/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-13/playboi-carti-and-amine-set-to-headline-extravaganza-2019/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-13/playboi-carti-and-amine-set-to-headline-extravaganza-2019/","id":6943,"author":{"id":667,"name":"Artsweek Staff"},"related":[6942,6941,6940],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Paul S.

Flores managed to garner a decent turnout for his evening of spoken word, hosted by the UCSB MultiCultural Center on Friday Nov. 5. The choice of Reds Bin 211 in downtown Santa Barbara’s “Funk Zone” for the venue turned out to be an apt one, since it was big enough to hold the crowd but small enough to be intimate, despite some issues with disruptive patrons.</p>\n<p>Flores walked on to Amy Winehouse’s “Stronger Than Me” and was bombastic and personable from the start. Throughout the evening he joked with both the DJ and audience members between poems and, even during more serious pieces, his energy never waned. As a San Francisco native, his passion for both his city and his half-Cuban, half-Mexican heritage motivated some of his best performances of the night. Eager to please, he apologised self-consciously for being too political or “a downer” whenever his poetry touched on raw subjects, yet it was in these moments that his performance was most powerful and garnered the biggest response from the audience.</p>\n<p>He opened effectively with “Spanglish,” a poem that alternated between rapid-fire Spanish and English to demonstrate the experience of having a transnational identity in what he described as a “multicultural but monolingual” U.S. While the poem was an excellent demonstration of his enduring connection to Chicano culture and his confidence as a spoken word artist, at points during this poem and the evening his delivery felt too studied and close to resembling a generic “Spoken Word voice”. However, these moments were brief and the potency and sincerity of the message behind his poems were more than enough to compensate.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Spanglish” was followed by two more muted and personal poems. The first concerned Flores’ determination to avoid repeating his father’s mistakes in his relationship with his own son. The poem was a moving depiction both of Flores’ personal vulnerabilities and the toxic effect of hyper-masculinity on male relationships in general and was far superior to the love poem that followed. This second poem, based on an Aztec poetry form, occasionally edged into trite imagery and involved a minor overuse of repetition common to a few of his later poems.</p>\n<p>Noting that he loves spoken word because “it gives you the opportunity to say what you need to say,” Flores then changed the tone completely with his angry but humorous poem to Donald Trump. This revenge fantasy of sorts that imagined Trump meeting fugitive Mexican drug lord “El Chapo.” He continued to gain momentum after this point and followed with a poem that celebrated the historical alliance between “black and brown,” which presented historical fact with a passion that was infectious and expressed his disappointment at how this coalition is supressed in the name of financial interest.</p>\n<p>Flores saved his best poem, a rant against gentrification in San Francisco’s Mission called “Crowbar Thing,” until almost the end of the evening. Inspired by an incident in which a bar owner beat three Mexican men with a crowbar for hanging around his establishment, the poem moved from the humorous, lampooning the “googlefucks” looking for somewhere ethnic enough to be trendy, to the tragic with ease.</p>\n<p>The evening finished more light-heartedly with the recipe poem “Arroz Con Pollo,” a rapturous celebration of Mexican food and how it brings people together, as well as a poem toasting the excellence of San Francisco city, an uplifting counterpart to the bitterness of “Crowbar Thing.” This return to the joyfulness and exuberance of “Spanglish” seemed crucial to his message of the endurance of oppressed peoples through hardship and injustice and also served to end the evening on a more positive note.</p>\n<p>Overall, Flores’ performance demonstrated clearly why he deserved to be named San Francisco Weekly’s “Best Politically Active Hip-Hop Performance Artist.” While he is at his most effective as a performer when incensed, he is not content to merely point out social problems and his poetry was always as hopeful as it was angry.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66365\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/paul-s-flores-comes-to-reds-bin-211/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66365\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/paul-s-flores-comes-to-reds-bin-211/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/paul-s-flores-comes-to-reds-bin-211/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/paul-s-flores-comes-to-reds-bin-211/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-11/paul-s-flores-comes-to-reds-bin-211/","id":6944,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[6943,6942,6941],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Sequel We Didn’t Need","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Literature","publish_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960.jpg?resize=960%2C540&ssl=1","description":"If the goal of Go Set a Watchman was to leave me both satisfied and disappointed, it succeeded.

On one hand, I got to read a second book by Harper Lee — a sequel to <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, no less. On the other hand, I couldn’t understand why a perfect book needed this mediocre sequel. Far from living up to its predecessor‘s reputation, <em>Watchman</em> undermined much of what made <em>Mockingbird</em> a masterpiece of American fiction.</p>\n<p><em>Watchman</em> reintroduces many familiar characters from the previous novel, but they haven’t all aged well. The most striking change is in Atticus Finch, now 72 years old, suffering from arthritis and revising his definition of equality. Where once stood an undisputed hero of the American justice system now sits a crippled conservative overwhelmed by the growing momentum of the Civil Rights Movement. The aging Atticus shocks his daughter Scout by attending a Citizens’ Council, where bigots have free reign to preach their hatred. At one point he refers to black men as incompetent children — a far cry from the hero who defended the innocent Tom Robinson in a hopeless case two decades prior.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Atticus’s daughter has grown up to be a calm and contemplative woman, though she remains the same mischievous girl in spirit. Even though Jean Louise Finch has outgrown her childhood nickname, I’m still going to call her Scout. Unlike in <em>Mockingbird</em>, Scout doesn’t narrate <em>Watchman</em>, instead acting as the main character of a third person story. The resulting style is comparatively detached and cool, as if to mirror Scout’s discomfort with the formality of adulthood.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the saving graces of <em>Watchman</em> is its humor. The funny moments are the ones that best resonate with its predecessor’s charm and bring the characters to life. One of my favorite scenes involves Scout being (falsely) accused of skinny-dipping at night, on which Atticus comments, “I hope you weren’t doing the backstroke.” Scout’s eccentric Uncle Jack, who was largely pushed into the background of <em>Mockingbird</em>, also gets more time in the spotlight. Uncle Jack helps Scout reach an understanding of her father, offering wisdom and wit peppered with obscure references to Victorian poetry.</p>\n<p>Other fun moments were the flashbacks interspersed throughout <em>Watchman</em> to expand on the childhood-centered plot of <em>Mockingbird</em>. Scout’s recollections show how a brash and tomboyish girl matured into a sensible young woman. Unfortunately, these touching scenes always seemed to occur totally separately from the main story, in a way that distracted from the more pressing issues of Scout’s evolving relationship with her father. As much as I enjoyed the glimpses of nostalgia, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that they were forced into this sequel.</p>\n<p>In fact, if I had to sum up <em>Watchman</em> in one word, it would be “forced.” The lesson at its end is ambiguous, just like Atticus himself. The conclusion amounts to Scout destroying her long-cherished vision of her father so that she can begin to regard him as a normal man. In other words, Atticus succeeds in disillusioning both his daughter and the audience. It’s an inadequate resolution one would expect from the work of an inexperienced writer.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, <em>Watchman</em> <em>is</em> the work of an inexperienced writer. Supposedly it is the recently “rediscovered” story that Harper Lee devised <em>before</em> reworking it into her great American novel. As the author is now almost 90 and never intended to publish another book, I side with the not unpopular opinion that <em>Watchman</em> should have stayed lost. It has its moments — it’s still Harper Lee, after all — but it’s best read as a study of the writer’s stylistic growth, or even as a rough draft.  If you’ve picked it up expecting a good story, prepare to be let down. Just hope you can handle reality better than Scout did.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66052\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66052\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/the-sequel-we-didnt-need/","id":6945,"author":{"id":180,"name":"Jason Chun"},"related":[6944,6943,6942],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
