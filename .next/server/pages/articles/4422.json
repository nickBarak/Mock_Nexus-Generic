He and his former business partner first approached their lawyer on Dec. 1, 2015; they launched over a month later on Jan. 28, 2016.</p>\n<p>Today, the Treehouse has between 850 and 1,000 customers.</p>\n<p>In the early days, he campaigned on foot with his friends by handing out flyers at fraternities, stapling them to telephone poles and handing out business cards as early as 8 a.m.</p>\n<p>These sacrifices haven’t ceased now that the business has grown. Barrett said his biggest challenge is the loss of his social life and youth. He cites stories of walking out during midterms because he had to answer business calls and driving all night with his friends to pick up product from San Francisco and be back before 10 a.m.</p>\n<p>“People think because I’m in this business I must smoke all the time, but I’ve never smoked less,” he said.</p>\n<p>Barrett now employs a UCSB senior, a recent graduate and two seasonal out-of-town workers. His former partner bowed out of the business due to parental backlash. However, the two remain on good terms.</p>\n<p>“I do cater to a lot of out-of-town patients, but the bread-and-butter daily routine is mostly from UCSB students,” he said.</p>\n<p>Barrett operates his company based on the “three Ps”: product, price and promptness. The Treehouse currently has the most five-star ratings in I.V. on Weedmaps, a source of pride for Barrett. He said all of the medicine sold is organic and that he goes out of his way to maintain the best quality.</p>\n<p>This attention to quality sometimes has financial consequences; one time he dropped a significant amount of product, which he then couldn’t sell. Product that dries before it can sell is taken off and slated for personal use rather than being sold to ensure that customers receive quality medicine.</p>\n<p>It is for this reason that he doesn’t like the direction recreational marijuana use is going. While he isn’t against the principle, he believes it needs to be better regulated and that sellers need to consider what customers are putting into their bodies.</p>\n<p>The biggest issue facing the business is banking, Barrett said. Because marijuana is still a federally regulated substance, banks do not accept money made off marijuana. Barrett described this as an “annoyance,” citing safety concerns for himself and his staff, difficulties of being a cash-only business and backlash from customers who wish to use credit cards to pay.</p>\n<p>“Stop thinking that we’re drug dealers,” he said. “I work a lot of hours, over 100 a week easily, over 120 … I’m earning it.”</p>\n<p>With regulations constantly changing and Barrett shifting his focus more toward cultivation, the future of the I.V. Treehouse Collective is uncertain.</p>\n<p>“I get asked all the time, ‘Would you sell it, would you sell it?’ and the answer is I don’t want to. It’s like asking if you would sell your child,” he said. “But the way the laws are written they technically say delivery services will be banned.”</p>\n<p>Despite these setbacks, he maintains hope for the future of the Treehouse. Cities like San Jose have started to issue registrations to allow dispensaries to deliver medical marijuana, giving hope that deliveries may not be completely banned.</p>\n<p>Barrett said he has also considered creating a physical storefront, but he was deterred by the amount of capital necessary.</p>\n<p>All profits he is making are going back into the business, particularly his farm. Though he lives comfortably, his lifestyle isn’t extravagant, and he pays his employees well.</p>\n<p>For Barrett personally, once he graduates he plans to leave Santa Barbara behind.</p>\n<p>“Monetarily, it makes a little bit more sense to be going up north,” he said. He plans to increase the cultivation side of the business and eventually use the proceeds to retire by 34 and move into other types of agriculture.</p>\n<p>“I love agriculture. I’ve always wanted to do crops, [but] it’s just expensive and marijuana’s a cash crop,” he said. “It got me into the industry I have always been dreaming of being in … I don’t have the money to buy 50 acres of almonds and start there.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

The win is a big momentum booster for the team as UCSB also ends its five-game winless streak with the victory, the longest run of games without a win this season. Meanwhile, Bakersfield drops to seven games below .500 at 20-27.</p>\n<p>With the game tied at 3-3 and seeming to be heading into extra innings, the Gauchos put the game out of reach in the eighth inning.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Freshman infielder Billy Fredrick came to pinch hit for senior catcher Jackson Morrow with the bases loaded and delivered a clutch RBI to start the hit parade for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB originally loaded the bases in the inning without earning a hit, getting runners on base by pass ball, walk and hit batter.</p>\n<p>The wheels fell off for Bakersfield after Fredrick’s hit. With the bases still loaded, senior left fielder Joey Epperson grounded out to score the runner from third and the next hitter, junior shortstop Peter Maris, doubled down the right field line to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to four runs.</p>\n<p>Sophomore relief pitcher Dillon Tate took over from there for the Gauchos. The right-hander had an easy 1-2-3 inning in the bottom of the eighth and quickly took care of business in the final inning by retiring the side in order. Tate pitched three innings of relief in total and gave up only one hit.</p>\n<p>Bakersfield had originally put the game in a deadlock in the sixth inning as sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza ran out of gas towards the end of his start. A single by the Roadrunners followed by a groundout advanced the runner to second base and into scoring position.</p>\n<p>Needing just one more out to escape the threat, Mazza allowed another single to put the game at 3-3.</p>\n<p>The game-tying run ended a three-inning scoring drought by both sides. Santa Barbara previously led 3-2 by scoring two runs on three hits and an error in the second inning. Epperson had an RBI single and Morrow later scored from third base on a pass ball.</p>\n<p>In the first inning, UCSB took the lead by tacking a run on a two-out RBI by junior designated hitter Greg Mahle. Mahle, who has had an impressive year pitching from the bullpen, was in the lineup in Tuesday’s game and singled through the right side to send Maris home from second base. Maris had previously doubled in his at-bat.</p>\n<p>The lead was short-lived as Bakersfield took the lead with two runs in the bottom half of the inning. With runners on first and second base, Mazza picked off the runner from first but allowed a triple to the next batter to tie the game at one apiece. Mazza gave up another extra-base hit before the inning ended to give CSUB a 2-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>UCSB now turns to this weekend when it will play Cal State Northridge for the final three-game set at home starting Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 7th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55180\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55180\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/","id":4419,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4418,4417,4416],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Striving to End Strong","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-08.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-08.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Travels North to Face San Francisco in Final Non-Conference Series  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB baseball team began the season with one of its best starts in program history.

USF came up on the losing side in each of those respective series and has won only twice in six games this year against the conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need all the help it can get going into this series.</p>\n<p>After failing to defeat Pepperdine in its last game, the last opponent that could have given the Gauchos a serious résumé booster ahead of the NCAA tournament selection, UCSB must win its remaining games to have any possibility of playing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>“There’s still a shot. All is not lost,” Epperson said. “We’re certainly in a really tough place right now as far as getting into the playoff picture. We would need to sweep both these next two weekends on the road.”</p>\n<p>The sense of desperation was felt in the 12-5 loss to the Waves. In that game, Head Coach Andrew Checketts resorted to using seven different pitchers and maintained a quick leash throughout the game.</p>\n<p>As early as the first inning, Checketts began experimenting with his pitching rotation after sophomore Domenic Mazza gave up UCSB’s two-run lead despite him throwing only 14 pitches.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB was hurt by its lack of efficiency on defense. The team committed five errors in crucial parts of the game that led to runs in what was one of its most disappointing defensive performances of the season.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of confidence in the guys and in our entire group,” Epperson said. “Unfortunately, we just didn’t win any aspect of the game: pitching, defense, offense. You’re not going to win any game when you’re not doing anything particularly well.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to turn things around but faces the challenge of doing it on the road. Given the Gauchos’ struggles away from home this year, playing with an 8-10 road record, the team will need to get on the board early and take advantage of scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>However, most of the losses have come against Big West opponents. Before losing to Pepperdine, UCSB had won its previous two non-conference road games.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has had productive performances from some of its players despite not winning as of late. Junior Greg Mahle has been doing double duty on the mound and from behind the plate as designated hitter.</p>\n<p>Known this season for his reliable relief pitching, Mahle has been in the lineup in four of UCSB’s last five games and is batting .414.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the bullpen, the left-hander has an ERA of 2.15 and has pitched the second-most innings on the team with 62.2.</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Peter Maris has had a breakout season for UCSB. In UCSB’s last five games, Maris batted at a .333 clip.</p>\n<p>His 2-5 hitting performance against Pepperdine was one of the bright spots for the Gauchos. The shortstop was added to the Brooks Wallace Award Watch List, one of 35 players included on the list that is given out to the nation’s best shortstop.</p>\n<p>USF will depend on junior outfielder Bradley Zimmer to knock in runs for the Dons.</p>\n<p>Zimmer recently made the 30-man cut for the Golden Spikes Award, the top honor given to the best amateur baseball player in the country.</p>\n<p>This season, Zimmer is hitting with a .366 batting average. He also has seven homeruns, six triples and 21 stolen bases.</p>\n<p>He is ranked within the top 60 in the country in both batting average and stolen bases. The junior leads his team’s offense.</p>\n<p>First pitch on Friday is scheduled for 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday’s games will each begin at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of May 15, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55316\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/striving-to-end-strong/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55316\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/striving-to-end-strong/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/striving-to-end-strong/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/striving-to-end-strong/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/striving-to-end-strong/","id":4420,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4419,4418,4417],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Wristbands, Booked Bands and Booze Stands: I.V.

Rather than having the informal Spring Break celebration, they hope that someday Deltopia could be a planned festival of sorts — one with alcohol vending, booked performances or perhaps more Mardi Gras marches.</p>\n<p>“I think that it will be really important for us moving forward instead of just trying to see Deltopia as a problem we can put a Band-Aid on from a law enforcement perspective,” said Spencer Brandt, who also serves as a director on the CSD board.</p>\n<p>UCPD sent in approximately 70 officers into I.V. this weekend, the lowest in recent years, considering that police have had as many as 300 officers in town during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“We need to be doing what we can to bring it out into the open and regulate it,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he envisions a Deltopia where organizers are “distributing wristbands, having music in the parks [and] selling alcohol out in an open place where it is regulated and we know who is able to purchase it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76839\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76839\" data-attachment-id=\"76839\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-11/in-photos-deltopia-weekend-2017/deltopia-by-mclane/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deltopia by McLane\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-76839 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76839\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some on the I.V.

Hundreds of partygoers would take inflatable rafts and other floatable devices into the water, hence the name.</p>\n<p>Police estimated as many as 1,000 attendees in the early years of Floatopia.</p>\n<p>Following complaints that the partying was having adverse effects on the environment, Santa Barbara County officials opted to close the beaches in 2010, placing barricades at the beach access points along Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>In response to the closure of Floatopia, Isla Vistans planned demonstrations on Del Playa Drive that they called Deltopia in 2010.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76841\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76841\" data-attachment-id=\"76841\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-11/in-photos-deltopia-weekend-2017/deltopia-crowd-mclane/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deltopia crowd McLane\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-76841 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-crowd-McLane.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I.V. residents coined the name “Floatopia,” the precursor to Deltopia, in 2003 after they took to the beaches and floated on inflatable rafts in the water. The event became Deltopia after officials closed the beaches in 2010. <em>McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, who served as Associated Students President from 2013-2014, referred to 2011 as the “in-between year” when residents interchangeably called the Spring Break celebration Floatopia and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>In the years following, the county continued to close the beaches and residents continued to bring the party to the streets, sticking with the name Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Attendance continued to grow each year, reaching approximately 10,000 in 2012 and approximately 18,000 in 2013.</p>\n<p>Riots broke out on the day of Deltopia 2014, when attendance maxed out at approximately 25,000. Officers arrested over 100 residents, according to police estimates.</p>\n<p>The riots led to broad discussion of the possibility of instituting a sanctioned Deltopia. Abboud said it was a primary issue in the last quarter of his A.S. presidency.</p>\n<p>“This was actually a very, very widely popular, talked-about issue in the few weeks following the riots,” he said. “[We thought,] let’s sanction it and make it work, you know? For the benefit for the community.”</p>\n<p>The idea lost momentum in A.S., however, at the occurrence of the May 23, 2014, shooting, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>While no stakeholders have officially sanctioned a Deltopia festival, UCSB student groups have developed programming around the informal celebration in efforts to increase the safety of students during the weekend.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board has, for the past three years, hosted an on-campus concert called The Warm Up, and the A.S. Public Safety Commission started a volunteer program called UC Isla Vista (UCIV) in 2015 in which students act as mediators between residents and police.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76921\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76921\" data-attachment-id=\"76921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deltopiaextra – mclanebrown\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-76921\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A sanctioned Deltopia could mean one with alcohol vendors, booked musical performances and Mardi Gras-like marches.

She added that the county told university administrators that it would not approve permits for the sanctioned event because of liability issues.</p>\n<p>“I was a part of those conversations with Jonathan [Abboud] there also, and I was in favor,” she said. “I felt like the county shut us down, so it certainly wasn’t UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Joan Hartmann, chair of the county Board of Supervisors, said she has not heard before that the county would not approve permits. She said, however, that she is open to exploring the idea of sanctioning the Spring Break celebration.</p>\n<p>Chris Bradley, a third-year environmental studies major who transferred from San Bernardino, said he expected police to “do a lot of cracking down” on Deltopia weekend, but he said he surprisingly had a lot of fun. A sanctioned Deltopia is an idea he is open to, he said.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t sound like bad thing,” he said. “This is my first year here, so I can’t really compare to anything else — like if it’d be a step up from something — but it doesn’t seem like a bad idea.”</p>\n<p>Brenda Cruz, a third-year communication major, said she thinks having a Deltopia festival would be “a lot more fun” and “a little more safe.”</p>\n<p>“Having it like an actual festival would be really fun [and] it’d be more controlled alcohol-wise, too, like being able to buy different kinds of alcohol, besides having just cheap stuff,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/","id":4421,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4420,4419,4418],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
