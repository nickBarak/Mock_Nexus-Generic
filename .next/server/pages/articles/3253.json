Michael Crabtree started it. All season long, Crabtree has been talking about Sherman and about how overrated he is. He was never quite blatant about it, and most of his comments were said when few people were watching. He surely never said anything on the same stage that Sherman did. But he said it nonetheless, and it was a chip that Sherman carried on his shoulder all season long.</p>\n<p>Then after all that, Sherman still went to congratulate Crabtree on “a hell of a game”. After the final whistle, Sherman went to shake Crabtree’s hand, but his olive branch was met with a hand in the face. Crabtree might be more quiet and passive-aggressive about it, but the unsportsmanlike conduct went both ways and started with Crabtree’s “DeMarcus Cousins-esque” rejection of civility. Imagine what Crabtree would have said about Sherman if Crabtree wasn’t a loser this season.</p>\n<p>So after that, Sherman was a little fired up. He has just made the game-winning play, sending his beloved team to the Super Bowl. The adrenaline was still pumping, and Sherman’s eyes had a fierce, hungry look in them.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>He had just proved all his critics wrong, yet, again, but there was still unfinished business to attend to. He wanted it to be perfectly clear to the whole world that his Seahawks were not the underdogs against anyone, including the red-hot 49ers and the mighty Denver Broncos.</p>\n<p>Sherman has had to defy the odds and make his statement through actions his entire career. Crabtree was a first-round draft pick, Sherman was a fifth-round pick. Crabtree is making top-ten-pick money, while Sherman is making the league minimum.</p>\n<p>Crabtree is being labeled as having the best-hands of all-time, a distinction that completely disrespects previous 49er legends such as Jerry Rice, while Sherman was still an unknown entity to NFL fans even this season. Yet Sherman has been to multiple Pro Bowls and leads the best defense in the NFL, while Crabtree is just a good player on an average offense.</p>\n<p>Even Crabtree’s after-the-fact retort was weak. After the game and the interview, Crabtree tweeted “Film don’t lie. Show me the tape where the guy is the best.” Well Mike, we could show you that tape of the final play of the game a thousand times, and you still won’t get the picture. The fact that there is no other tape besides that play is a testament to the extent of which your quarterback fears Sherman Island.</p>\n<p>Which begs the question: Who do you want on your team? Seattle fans and Sherman’s teammates alike adore their star cornerback. He has demonstrated loyalty, intensity and excellence ever since he came to Seattle, and his trash talking is funny and endearing to everyone who isn’t on the receiving end of it. Pete Carroll approves of Sherman’s aura and believes it inspires the rest of the Legion of Boom.</p>\n<p>Sherman backs up his trash talk on the field and is a well-spoken, respectful, interesting dude off the field. I don’t think any “thugs”, as Niner fans refer to Sherman, have graduated from Stanford with a GPA hovering around 4.0.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that Sherman is the best cornerback in the game, and if his intensity and trash talking in the game are part of what makes him the best in the world, that’s just something fans must live with. The 12th man is behind Sherman every step of the way and love who he is on and off the field.</p>\n<p>While Sherman’s postgame interview might have been a little off-putting to some, it was an extreme and highly publicized moment. It was the culmination of years of adversity being overcome, expressed in the heat of the moment after a positive gesture was rejected. Crabtree needs to shut his mouth and hit the practice field if he wants to say anything about Sherman in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 29, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/","id":3250,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3249,3248,3247],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Leaders for the Next Great Japanese Pitcher","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tanaka.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tanaka.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Masahiro Tanaka might be the next great Japanese pitcher to come to the MLB. The pitcher must sign a contract with his new team by this Friday if he hopes to play in the MLB next season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With all due respect to new additions Robinson Cano of the Seattle Mariners, Jacoby Ellsbury and Brian McCann of the New York Yankees and Prince Fielder of the Texas Rangers, the biggest superstar on the move this offseason has yet to find a home in Major League Baseball. And no, I’m not talking about Manny Ramirez and his latest comeback bid.</p>\n<p>Of every player getting a new contract or switching teams via trade, none will make the kind of franchise-changing impact over the duration of their deal as Masahiro Tanaka will. The pitching sensation, formerly of the Rakuten Golden Eagles, is the kind of talent who can be built around as a cornerstone for the long haul or be added to a current contender as the final piece on the way to being named World Series favorites.</p>\n<p>Tanaka is just 25 years old and coming off what may be the best season for a pitcher in Japanese Baseball history. He went 24-0 with a 1.27 ERA on way to an MVP award and a Japan Series championship. The superstar from Hyogo started 30 consecutive games without recording a loss, a streak that lasted until his 160-pitch effort in game six of the Japan Series. Tanaka then bounced back to close out game seven and secure a championship for the Golden Eagles.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>From a scouting perspective, Tanaka has the makeup to match the numbers. He stands at 6’2” with a smooth, repeatable delivery that results in pinpoint control (183 strikeouts to 32 walks in 2013).</p>\n<p>Although he doesn’t have the overwhelming power fastball of the other Asian pitcher who came to America in recent memory with this much hype, 6’5” Texas Rangers pitcher Yu Darvish, Tanaka’s heater sits in the low 90’s and comes with a great horizontal slider to offset it. His out-pitch is a split-finger fastball that will instantly be among the best in baseball and bring back memories of Roger Clemens. Like Darvish, Tanaka utilizes a wide repertoire of pitch types to keep hitters off-balance, including off-speed pitches and a variety of cuts and sinking breaks on his fastball.</p>\n<p>In style and professional background, Tanaka resembles Hiroki Kuroda of the Yankees and Hisashi Iwakuma of the Mariners more than Darvish, but the level of success in Japan is more reminiscent of the latter. Given that all three pitchers are Cy Young contenders at their best, Tanaka faces high hopes and expectations. His predecessors established a blueprint for a successful Japan to U.S. transition, and while not every import is a success story (see: Daisuke Matsuzaka), Tanaka has shown the potential to be the greatest of them all.</p>\n<p>The question on everyone’s mind remains: Where will Tanaka sign? The courting process is coming to an end with teams making their pitches and final offers. According to the new international posting rules, Tanaka must sign by Friday, which means he will have to announce his decision by Wednesday in order to allow a couple days for the necessary physical examination.</p>\n<p>Five teams have been named as “finalists” for Tanaka’s services. The New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers are widely regarded as the favorites to sign him, for a variety of reasons. The Yankees are in desperate need of a new ace pitcher and are opening up the checkbook with no further regard for the luxury tax threshold. In previous years, what would have been a sure-thing signing for the Yankees is not so concrete today. They have the money and the need, but Tanaka is said to prefer the west coast. His wife is a pop star in Japan, and the bright lights of Hollywood might affect his decision. If Tanaka wants to play for a contender while also being the unquestioned staff ace, the Yankees might have the edge. If Tanaka wants to play for the best team on paper with no regard for his spot in the rotation, he might choose Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers under Stan Kasten are the new big spenders in baseball and have yet to make a big splash this offseason. Even after signing Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw to long-term contracts, money is still no object for Los Angeles, especially considering they will have the huge contracts of Josh Beckett, Chad Billingsley and Dan Haren off the books by 2015, clearing up over $40 million a year in payroll.</p>\n<p>Kasten worked for the Atlanta Braves during their 1990’s dynasty, when Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz dominated the National League East. He obviously has similar aspirations with this Dodger team, and a rotation of Kershaw, Greinke, Tanaka and Hyun-Jin Ryu would be really difficult to beat in a seven-game series.</p>\n<p>Three other teams, the Chicago Cubs, Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago White Sox, have also made offers to Tanaka. Arizona in particular plans to offer every penny they can scrounge up in an attempt to woo Tanaka. The D’Backs need to take their team to the next level to compete with the other juggernauts in the National League West, and getting a great pitcher for the next decade would be a good place to start.</p>\n<p>The Cubs are rebuilding under the guidance of Theo Epstein and would offer Tanaka the chance to slowly adjust to American baseball while comfortably being the face of the franchise when they finally start to contend in a couple years. The White Sox do not have a ton of appeal, but are making a strong push anyway. Consider Seattle and the Los Angeles Angels to be dark horses in the Tanaka sweepstakes.</p>\n<p>Whatever team wins the bidding for Tanaka, expect the deal to average around $20 million a year. Even though he has no MLB experience, $120 million over six years seems like a fair price to pay for a pitcher who is just entering his prime.</p>\n<p>Based on teams’ spending power, ability to contend, location, international marketing appeal and long-term track record, the Dodgers seem to have the slight edge on the Yankees for signing Tanaka. However, nobody will really know his priorities until a decision is made. Based on Tanaka’s Twitter post expressing his inability to reach a final decision, expect the race to come down to a photo finish at the end of the deadline.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of january 22, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53633\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53633\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/leaders-for-the-next-great-japanese-pitcher/","id":3251,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3250,3249,3248],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Recap: External Vice President for Statewide Affairs Forum","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EVPSA-forum.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EVPSA-forum.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The two EVPSA candidates are third-year Alexandra Leal Silva and second-year Daevionne Beasley.

He also noted that the general student body “isn’t necessarily up to par” on what the organization does and where student fees go, so he wants to change that and make sure students voices are “head at a state-wide and national level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she has been working within the EVPSA office since her first year at UCSB – first as an EVPSA fellow, then as a community organizing director, and then as the legislative director – and now feels that she now has enough experience to run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We as students are the future of the state, of this county, and we deserve to have a space in these vocations and be able to speak to what it is you need in order to be successful, what our students need in order to be successful.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any experience organizing UCSB students at the statewide level, such as lobby, or with UC wide-work? What have your experiences shown you about some of the issues facing students today? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she has had a lot of experience lobbying for students, again referencing her past three years in the EVPSA office. She further noted that she is a member of Lobby Corps, and has been organizing student trips to the U.S. Senate, the legislator and Capitol Hill through this entire past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They need to hear where they’re at because they are living in this bubble, this congressional bubble. I’m going to be able to pop that and say, ‘hey, we are your students.

I absolutely love it and I appreciate every moment of getting to help students fight for the fight.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Can you name some of the communities on the UCSB campus that you believe are the most marginalized? As the new EVPSA, how would you attempt to amplify these voices that you have mentioned and how do you ensure that students of all backgrounds are represented?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said Black students are the most marginalized community at UCSB, making up 4% of the campus. He said Black students don’t get the same institutional support that other groups may have, and said that either he or someone on his staff would be in attendance at Black Student Union (BSU) board meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said that while he cannot speak to the experiences of other marginalized students on campus, he would make sure to compose his office of people from different backgrounds as to increase representation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it comes to legislation… on the floor right now, to reaffirm the standards for deadly force for police officers and UCPD and California as a whole, we really need Black students to advocate on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she wants to listen to all voices on campus, and would take those concerns to the “state, to the federal government, to the Regents because [everyone’s] experiences matter.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The EVPSA is a servant to its community. It’s time to take that to the next level and I’m ready to serve my students at any capacity.” </span></p>\n<p><b>In the past year, have you had any direct involvement with the EVPSA office, and whether you have or not, what would you change about the office?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva repeated that fact that she has been in the office these past three years, noting the hardships that came with not having an EVPSA this past year. She added that her work as a Resident Assistant and as a UCSB tour guide gives her a “unique perspective” and further knowledge as to how to serve students best. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley also referenced the lack of an EVPSA during this past year, stating that “put students in a very hard position.” He added that the lack of someone in that position forced students into “non-institutional routes” to try and make change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he worked with 2017-2018 EVPSA Kristin Hsu during his first year, going on lobby trips and advocating for extending the Cal Grant. </span></p>\n<p><b>Thanks to the amazing work from UCSB’s voter registration volunteer coalition, UCSB has set national records on voter registration and voter turnout. How would you work with UCSB’s student-run voter registration coalition to increase voter turnout even further into 2020? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said it’s “absolutely incredible” that UCSB has one of the highest registered voters out of any campus in the nation. He said that while civic engagement is already very important to UCSB students, that would be expanded to work with more organizations on campus by tabling and registering people to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know you might feel a little bit discouraged with the political climate right now, and it’s very easy to think that, ‘oh, national or any type of election doesn’t matter [because] our voices aren’t heard.’ But I’m here to say… that is not true. Each and every single voice counts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva referenced the UC coordinator position within the office,  who “works tirelessly throughout the year to reinvigorate the [registration volunteer coalition program].” She added onto Beasley’s point by stating that she will expand that role, while also working to include the voices of students who don’t have the ability to vote. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you plan on getting students interested in attending EVPSA functions such as Regents meetings?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said that accessibility has been an issue not just within the EVPSA office, but within A.S. overall. She said she would work to be as “transparent as possible.” She also noted that the office should table toward the beginning of the year in order to gauge issues that students care about, and then set up a system that would alert them when the office is doing work on an issue they care about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The work that these students are doing is fueled by passion and grit and the will to serve, and we need to be able to highlight that and show students, ‘these are what your students are doing. This is why they care. This is how you can get involved.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said his work as a Resident Assistant allowed him to see that marketing is the key to making sure students attend events. He said he wouldn’t let students know about events through “a robotic way, like through email.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Considering the budget restraints nationwide, what specific portion of the budget and Higher Education Act would you advocate for? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said specific numbers cannot be counted until it is known how much tax revenue California has. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The nation as a whole needs to prioritize education, needs to put that at the forefront, because education builds the leaders for tomorrow… Education is a right and people need to be educated on the issues that they’re fighting for.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva referenced California Governor Gavin Newsoms’ budget that was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-newsom-allocates-400-million-to-uc-system-aiming-to-increase-student-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">released earlier this year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She noted that while his goal for the UC system to intake more students is “fabulous,” it is ultimately hard to accommodate more students because “we can barely accommodate the ones we have.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we’re talking about budget asks, what we’re advocating for, we need to be looking at things like basic needs. We need to be looking at things and making sure we’re funding our resources. We need to be looking at things like deferred maintenance – we have buildings falling apart, we have elevators that you wouldn’t dare step in because you value your life.” </span></p>\n<p><b>What would be the very first issue you will tackle if you are elected as EVPSA? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said the first thing she would tackle is financial aid expansion. She added that she wants to bring back the pell grant and wants to look into expanding the middle class scholarship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without financial aid, I wouldn’t even be standing up here. You want to talk about subsidized housing, food stamps? That is me. Still will probably be me for a while, but it’s because of financial aid that I’m able to attend this university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said he wants to make sure that marginalized students’ voices are “uplifted and heard.” He said that, if elected, he would “bring these people that are often put at the bottom of the social hierarchy and make sure they’re brought to the top.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t have one person of color or one marginalized student there and expect them to advocate on behalf of everyone that’s not present. My first task in the office will be making sure that I have a diverse enough staff to be able to bring some of the issues [to me] that need to be talked about.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
