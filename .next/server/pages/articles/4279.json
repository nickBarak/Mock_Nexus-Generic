Within seconds, Yokota quickly received likes, comments and messages in response to her post.</p>\n<p>“For some reason it just blew up like crazy, so quickly, too. The second I posted it, my phone was blowing up with messages and notifications.”</p>\n<p>At the time of the <em>Nexus</em>’ interview with Yokota, there were a total of 73 members in the GroupMe for Coast Carvers and approximately 100 people who had contacted Yokota about her post, from newcomers to I.V. to experienced skaters to parents asking Yokota to teach their own kids how to skate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83848\" style=\"width: 1368px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83848\" data-attachment-id=\"83848\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/coast-carvers-hit-the-streets-of-isla-vista/unnamed-2-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1358%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1358,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83848\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C1339\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1339\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1358&amp;ssl=1 1358w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1158&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 679w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83848\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Masaki Osato</em></p></div>\n<p>Yokota founded the group after taking interest in a similar female skating group based out of Venice Beach called GRLSWRL, which is “a modern-retro all-female stoke-chasing community focused on bringing femininity… to the male dominated skate scene,” according to the group’s website.</p>\n<p>Yokota was never able to attend one of GRLSWRL’s bi-weekly scheduled skate sessions, but from meeting up for casual skate sessions with some of the members, she felt that I.V. would provide the ideal space for a group with similar purposes.<br>\n“It’s something that Isla Vista kind of needed, but nobody knew it needed that,” Yokota said.</p>\n<p>Although they have similar missions, the two groups hold some key differences, such as Coast Carvers’ inclusion of “anything that shreds in I.V.,” namely roller-skating and surfing in addition to skating. Yokota says this inclusion is ideal for their group given the diversity of sports and hobbies practiced by girls in I.V.</p>\n<p>Yokota also notes variations in the general energy and mood of the two skate groups, which she attributes to the differences of the locations that each group call home.</p>\n<p>“[In Venice] there’s just a bunch of random people and strangers and it’s really crowded, it’s kind of stressful,” Yokota said. “But then when I skated on DP, it was a Sunday evening and I just had my nine girls with me, and it was just really peaceful honestly.”</p>\n<p>Being a girl in the world of skating can prove to be intimidating for many people, she said. The seemingly overwhelming proportion of men to women who skate can make it difficult for women feel confident attending skateparks and the like, but skating in groups like Coast Carvers can afford them a sense of support and companionship, according to Yokota.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to full-send something when you’re just scared… so having girls around you just kind of builds your confidence,” Yokota said. “I don’t want girls to feel like they can’t do things just because they are girls or because there aren’t enough girls doing something.”</p>\n<p>Yokota is hopeful that Coast Carvers will continue to grow once the academic year begins. At that time, she plans to have scheduled skate sessions during the week and wants to eventually create an executive board to help run the club.</p>\n<p>Depending on the success of the group in the next year, Yokota has also been toying with the idea of expanding Coast Carvers into a multi-chapter organization in order to create a network of girl skaters both locally and regionally.</p>\n<p>“That’s what called out to me, is that I could be a part of something bigger.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Jugglers with a variety of styles and talents will perform at I.V. Theater on Saturday evening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I.V. was the first juggling festival I ever attended,” he said. “The public show definitely helped my career path as a performer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was first held in 1976 to honor local juggler and UCSB student Patty Laney, according to Fiasco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laney, who was 21 at the time of her death, had been an avid juggler and activist for women’s rights on campus before her murder. In her honor, the juggling community of I.V. began organizing a benefit show which ultimately turned into the now-three-day festival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is an extremely welcoming environment and commonplace for people to approach total strangers for help or to engage in group juggle passing,” Fiasco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profits from the festival will be donated to the Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) organization, formerly named Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83049\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/annual-juggling-festival-returns-to-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83049\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/annual-juggling-festival-returns-to-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/annual-juggling-festival-returns-to-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/annual-juggling-festival-returns-to-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/annual-juggling-festival-returns-to-i-v/","id":4278,"author":{"id":242,"name":"Anyi Cheng"},"related":[4277,4276,4275],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
