","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was 10 years old when I realized I wanted to move to California. After watching every episode of “</span><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493093/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Montana</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” and listening to Tupac’s “</span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/5wBTdfAkqGU\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Love</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” “California Love,” I knew there was something special about “the sunshine state where that bomb-ass hemp be, the state where you never find a dance floor empty.” The dreams of sunny skies, beautiful people and crazy parties slithered into my imagination, making me yearn for carefree days at the beach and drives on Highway 101 with the windows down, feeling the ocean breeze on my skin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I had the opportunity to move out west for college, I knew I had to do it. I also knew it would come with some changes — but that was the point. I wanted change. I wanted exposure to new people and new experiences. I had a serious lack of Vitamin D, and I was sick of having conversations with people who thought building the wall was the solution to all of America’s problems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. Despite there being too many conservatives, having to scrape ice off of my car everyday before school in the winter and OSU fans dedicating their lives to football (because, let’s face it, there’s not much else to do), I still love Ohio. No matter how much I wanted to leave, and how happy I am to be in sunny and liberal California, nothing ever compares to home.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

It has also made me turn my head and laugh quite a few times when I see t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he accuracy in my preconceived notions and stereotypes of Californian culture before I moved here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On my first day of school, I rode my bike to campus and saw more bikes and skateboards than I’ve ever seen in one place at a time. People don’t skate where I’m from because it’s too cold or rainy, and people don’t bike because there aren’t enough bike paths. We love to drive everywhere — so environmentally conscious! I was a little nervous seeing so many bikes in one place — I even crashed into another bike while attempting to turn into the HSSB — but that’s beside the point. Everyone was in good shape, peddling or skating and making their way to class. Wow — environmentally friendly </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> active. Check that off the unconscious list of stereotypes I keep in my head about Californians.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I walked into one of my first lectures, a feminist studies class. My professor started out by asking us what is making us mad in this world where climate change, income inequality, religious conflict and so many other pressing issues drown our hopes for the future. For almost two hours, people raised their hands expressing their fury about our president and the inequalities millions of disadvantaged people face in this wack system that we call America. People are woke here. Another check off of my mental list of Californian stereotypes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In another class, my professor came to lecture with wet hair from a surf sesh he hit right before class and drank green juice. Check. My TA for another class skated to section and wore backwards hats and muscle tees a little too often.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Definitely would not find this in Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another new concept that I’ve gotten acquainted with since moving here is astrology. An overwhelming amount of people that I’ve met at UCSB believe in it wholeheartedly. My family and friends at home would laugh if they knew how many times people have told me, “Oh, you’re a Leo. It totally makes sense.” Or: “You should look at careers that fit your astrological sign. I’m a Gemini and we’re supposed to be really good communicators, so I’m majoring in communication.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family and friends at home would laugh if they knew how many times people have told me, “Oh, you’re a Leo. It totally makes sense.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One time, I even had a Lyft driver who, within the span of 10 minutes, described how his planetary alignment was off because “Mercury was in retrograde,” and because of this, he had been microdosing on shrooms all weekend. This was my ride back to the dorms after going home for winter break. It was the perfect paradoxical transition to being back in California from Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting adjusted to new faces, classes, neighborhoods and scenery, California has become hard not to love. Although my </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clichéd </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">image of everyone being a free-spirited hippie and having a good time lounging in the sun has been proven true at times, I can’t dismiss the actual issues that surround millions of people in the state of California</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Wildfires, an infeasible cost of living and racial and income inequality engross the lives of California natives everyday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is easy to recognize and laugh at all of the stereotypical images people at UCSB have done a wonderful job portraying, it is important to acknowledge what goes on beyond the fantasized idea of living in California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, moving to California has been an eye opening experience, not just in self-discovery, but a deeper look into the world and lives that surround me.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Maybe the EDM music, overpriced avocado toast and hot yoga obsession is a little over the top at times, but overall the progressive atmosphere and unique people that I have met has made it easy to adjust to my new home.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carley Weiler thinks that California and UCSB live up to the stereotypes.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89087\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89087\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-24/stereotypes-of-californians-are-scarily-accurate/","id":5626,"author":{"id":800,"name":"Carley Weiler"},"related":[5625,5624,5623],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":800,"name":"Carley Weiler","biography":"Not available","articles":[5626,5655,6413],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Argument in the Office: The Merits of Read Receipts","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Argument in the Office","publish_date":"2019-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Opinion writers Ally McCulloch and Simon Ahrens face off on the societal value of read receipts. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has undoubtedly changed how we communicate for the better. We now have the power to reach people on the other side of the world and learn about current events almost instantly. We use texting and social media to keep in contact with acquaintances and loved ones. We send kissy-face emojis to show affection and write happy birthday on our friends’ timelines. I live hundreds of miles away from my best friends and family members, yet I feel as close to them as ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, texting and the like has also created a dimension of communication that has never existed before — a type of communication that doesn’t require any words at all. Apple has dominated the electronic world for years now. Almost every single person we know owns one an Apple phone (unless you’re a fringe Android user). Centered at the forefront of modern communication, Apple was the first to create an option to show if the person you are texting has read your message. Now, apps like Facebook and Instagram have followed this trend and automatically use read receipts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is ridiculous, I know I am not the only one who gets extremely butthurt, for lack of a better word, when I see someone has read my message and chosen to not respond. My mind starts to wander: Did I say something wrong? Should I send another text? Do they hate me? I thought we were close but I guess not…. It’s as if a switch in my mind has been turned on and I frantically worry my relationship with this person is now suddenly different. Usually, the next time I see him or her I will realize that I was over-exaggerating and that switch will be turned right back off. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mysteriousness of not knowing whether someone has just skipped over your text on accident or is purposefully ignoring you is beautiful in my eyes.

I simply just don’t have anything to say in response or get overwhelmed by the constant need to be connected with others. I want to sit with my thoughts for a couple days, or even hours, and respond when I am ready. Hypocritically, when I do this, of course it is harmless or a simple mistake. But then others do the same, I want to curl up in my room and never come out.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mind starts to wander: Did I say something wrong?

The problem is that emotions cannot be interpreted as effectively without observing facial expressions and verbal tones.

While many of my friends voice their contempt for this whole level of passive aggressive messaging, I have always appreciated the credible information of the read receipt option whether that is proof for my friend’s ignorance or the clear message of my brother’s disinterest. And let’s be honest, feeding our relationship mind games, our inner control demons just want to know whether someone has read our messages or ditched us again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a private chat, my experience is that read receipts also positively impact conversation flows and response time. Once you have opened a message your partner is notified, so you are nudged into responding instantly. Although potentially a source for misunderstandings, a read receipt is a message in itself. And it is even more effective than not replying without the function. You can now avoid uncomfortable rejections or half-hearted conversations by signalling apparent disinterest without utilizing the power of words. It is essentially the straightforward way of finally “telling” your stalking admirer to bugger off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from facilitating the inconvenient task of giving someone the brush-off, I am convinced that read receipts convey a deep feeling of community and connection. Most people underestimate the reliability in planning and the lack of the feeling of insecurity provided by the function. This applies not only to meeting your date but also in group messages when you spontaneously decide to move your party from your friend’s house to Bill’s Bus on a Thursday night. Also, who has not experienced the beauty of immediate bonding when you text someone for the first time and you see they have the read receipt function as well? I kid you not, it is just mind-blowing to feel this deep connection of living life on the same page with your fellow iPhone buddies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not want technology in general and the read receipt function in particular to control your deepest fears, you can either go on a life changing phone detox or choose options to read messages without triggering the read receipt. But let’s face it, the detox is probably just one of many new year’s resolutions we won’t fulfil this year so let’s stick to alternatives that include keeping our instruments of sin in our pockets.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although potentially a source for misunderstandings, a read receipt is a message in itself. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we are a student newspaper dedicated to improving student communication for overall happiness and love I would like to end by offering some exclusive sneaky alternatives to circumvent read receipts for y’all: First, the screen pull-down technique allows you to read texts without triggering receipts so you are not pressured to reply at all and your conversation partners are for once not crying themselves to sleep. For our bougie Tim Cook supporters, a.k.a. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">owners of an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus: You guys can use the new Peek feature to view your screen without triggering the function.

And now, for a change: Immerse yourself in some face-to-face conversations that render this whole messaging magic useless.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens emphasises the usefulness of read receipts but warns against taking them too seriously. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/77ba7e342d6b8818e9cdf560b4d82a29?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/77ba7e342d6b8818e9cdf560b4d82a29?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ally-mcculloch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ally McCulloch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ally McCulloch is an Opinion staff writer.

that “when someone says hello or smiles at you, your automatic reaction is to say hello or smile back.” Human beings as a whole strive to make connections to feel included in the group around them. In fact, the importance of greeting others has even been supported with movements such as “Just Say Hello,” a campaign supported by celebrities such as Oprah and Tom Hanks. You know that if Oprah supports something, it has to be legitimate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saying “Hello” is a key part in building community, which is why it’s part of my job as a desk attendant in the residence halls to greet everyone who walks into the lobby. Chances are, if you’ve walked past the front desk in my residence hall, you’ve probably been met with my only-vaguely-mechanical-sounding “Hello.” For the most part, people return the gesture and say “Hello” back. Sometimes, I even get a “How’s it going?” If you’re one of these people, the rest of this article does not apply to you. I appreciate how polite you are, and I’m glad to be one of your desk attendants. You are a gem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the rest of you though, I have one simple question.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why won’t you say “Hi” back? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of you look me straight in the eyes, making intense eye-contact as you walk by. “Hello!” I say cheerfully.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quick scroll through the Urban Outfitters’ website initially yields nothing new: overpriced sparkly party frocks, BDG mom jeans and those ugly FILA sneakers for which I can’t bear to jump on the bandwagon. But suddenly I do a double take when I click on the ‘Wellness’ section and see a host of vibrators, dildos and other various sex toys placed innocuously underneath the ‘Self Love’ division. A look at the Free People website reveals the same, albeit more expensive, result. Owned by the same parent company, Anthropologie, this sudden movement of younger-skewed brands to start marketing sex toys to a strongly feminist, sexually liberated generation smells strongly of bullshit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex-positive feminism is nothing new — it has been a movement embedded within the feminist community since the early 1980s. However, it seems that late Millennial and early Generation X women were swayed by the heavy presence of pornography-friendly sites like Tumblr in adolescence, leading to a positive outlook toward sex — notably masturbation and an emphasis on female pleasure. These early steps of social media sex positivity have led to a wide variety of successful multiplatform sex-themed websites and podcasts, including </span><a href=\"https://killerandasweetthang.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Killer and a Sweet Thang</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guys We F****d </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WHOREible Decisions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: all outlets where female-centric, queer-friendly and “taboo” sex practices take center stage. The demographic for brands like Urban Outfitters and Free People experienced a social media-induced sexual awakening in the mid-2010s that led to the radical conclusion that hey — maybe female pleasure isn’t such a big taboo after all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the onset, it seems great that mainstream companies like Urban Outfitters and Free People are jumping at the chance to support female sexuality. But after a closer examination, I am hesitant to buy into the free love narrative fed by a company in which only </span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/01/urban-outfitters-board-women/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22 percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the executive board is comprised of women. Maybe I’m just jaded, but for some reason, I am reluctant to believe that a bunch of older men of the Urban Outfitters board are super on board with the narrative of women loudly and proudly owning their sexuality. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These companies care about your money, not your orgasm.

In 2010, Urban Outfitters published a picture of an already tiny model in a slouchy v-neck emblazoned with the phrase </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/09/15/how-urban-outfitters-trades-on-moral-outrage/?utm_term=.b9282110ad07\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“eat less”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and have since been embroiled in </span><a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/480961/15-urban-outfitters-controversies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">several scandals</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> involving accusations of racial insensitivity, cultural appropriation and downright theft. Free People has additionally been accused of </span><a href=\"https://www.today.com/style/free-people-accused-appropriating-native-american-culture-festival-line-t85821\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appropriating</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Native American culture for festival lines. When major clothing companies don’t care about being socially, culturally or racially sensitive, why would they suddenly flip the script and support what has been a sexual taboo for generations? They’re simply just looking to turn a profit.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These companies care about your money, not your orgasm.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urban’s long and arduous list of scandals in juxtaposition with its sudden jump to selling vibrators, lube, whips and other bedroom-related products reeks of performative wokeness. Why would a company so notoriously nonchalant about apologizing for wrongdoings care about anything beyond their brand’s profit? When searching for products concerning one of the most intimate facets of a woman’s life, it seems illogical and counterproductive to patronize a brand that values business over people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a whole host of feminist companies that have been in the business of supporting female sexuality long before big companies sought out to capitalize on the “trend” of female pleasure. </span><a href=\"https://www.goodvibes.com/s/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good Vibrations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been a trailblazer in the industry, operating since 1977. </span><a href=\"https://www.babeland.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babeland</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has been around since 1993, is wholeheartedly committed to sex education and community involvement.

Those in search of DIY orgasms would have to drive to a sex shop situated in a strip mall on the opposite side of town and peruse the aisles with eyes averted from the other customers, paying cash at the register to avoid a paper trail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, all that shame and secrecy has flown out the window. Just this past year, millions of fed-up women </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/13/metoo-impact-hashtag-made-online/1633570002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weaponized a single hashtag</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to rewrite the rules of a convoluted sexual landscape. Buzz words like “empowerment” and “sex-positivity” represent the current iteration of feminism to which millennials subscribe. The feminists of 2019 sport “Pussy Power” buttons on their backpacks. They skip brunch to attend women’s marches. They open up about their sexuality not only to their closest friends but to their Twitter feeds as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And they shop for sex toys not in a dimly lit hole in the wall, but in the wide-open, colorful paradise of Urban Outfitters. Thanks to this mainstream retail outlet and its new collection of </span><a href=\"https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/self-love-products\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“self-love” products</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, female pleasure is just as accessible as a ’90s-inspired slip dress or a coffee table book of dad jokes. Featuring items such as bath bombs, “sex dust” (whatever that means) and emoji-shaped vibrators, the line advances an indulgent, pleasure-centered understanding of sexuality that “empowered” women are demanding in 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though these products may not be direct political statements, their arrival in the midst of a feminist revolution is no coincidence. Urban Outfitters is just one name in a long list of companies that have capitalized on hot-button social issues in recent years. Through ad campaigns like Gillette’s “</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Best Men Can Be</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” and Nike’s </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lomlpJREDzw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colin Kaepernick commercial</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, brands have attempted to align themselves with the political sensibilities of their consumers. Many of these campaigns have received backlash from news and social media critics who believe corporations should not be hailed as trailblazers of activism for nominally supporting social causes in order to sell razors or basketball shorts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is true that brands are profit-driven and don’t always follow their activist lip service with donations to causes or specific calls to action. These criticisms carry heavy weight at a time when Americans are becoming increasingly fed up with our country’s Machiavellian, profit-driven economic system. Among 18 to 29-year-olds — the demographic to which Urban Outfitters caters — </span><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approval ratings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of capitalism have plummeted by 23 percent in the past eight years.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the marketers at Urban Outfitters, a vibrator is not just a vibrator. It’s a symbol that their company endorses an open, shameless, modern vision of female sexuality.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as much as we hate the system, we must acknowledge that companies are meeting disillusioned shoppers in the middle by infusing a much-desired sense of meaning into the matrix of material consumption. According to a </span><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/championing-change-in-the-age-of-social-media/#Key-Findings\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two-thirds of Americans believe it’s “important for brands to take public stands on social and political issues.” Right now, consumers are demanding more than just products; they hope to spend their hard-earned money on symbolic representations of their deeply held beliefs. Gillette no longer sells razors; they sell a positive and healthy form of masculinity. Nike no longer sells sneakers and basketball shorts; they sell a bold commitment to racial equity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the marketers at Urban Outfitters, a vibrator is not just a vibrator. It’s a symbol that their company endorses an open, shameless, modern vision of female sexuality. Yes, this statement is undoubtedly motivated by profit. But it is a statement nonetheless, and a positive one at that. The </span><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sex-and-relationships/masturbation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of masturbation are numerous; the activity is known to reduce stress, improve sleep quality and improve body image, just to name a few. Unlike other controversial Urban Outfitters </span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/09/15/urbans-kent-state-sweatshirt-and-7-other-controversial-clothes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">products</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that have profited off the shock value of things, like eating disorders and the Kent State shooting, sex toys are not harming anyone except conservative parents who don’t want their daughters to know what an orgasm feels like. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a trendy brand like Urban Outfitters in 2019, delivering sexual pleasure to their female consumer base can only be seen as a savvy business decision. I would advise curious female readers to put aside their anxieties about capitalism for a few minutes, pull up the Urban Outfitters website and treat themselves to some much-needed self-love. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laurel Rinehart thinks there’s nothing wrong with corporations getting on board with the trend of sex positivity.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
