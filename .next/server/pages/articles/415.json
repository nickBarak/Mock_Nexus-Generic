Ware knocked down a jumper with 4:32 remaining to give the Gauchos a 17-9 lead as they built an early cushion, but the Big West’s reigning Athlete of the Week in Davis’s senior forward Sydnee Fipps answered back with a pair of triples to cut the lead to 17-15.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara took a 21-17 lead into halftime, holding the Aggies to just 5-22 from the field as both teams struggled to find the basket.</p>\n<p>The second half told an entirely different story as both teams became hot from the field. A three-pointer by UCSB’s senior guard Kristine Brance broke a 27-27 tie to give the Gauchos a three point lead at the 13:55 mark. A pair of free throws by freshman forward Chaya Durr capped a 6-0 run which put UCSB up 36-29 with 10:44 left.</p>\n<p>The Aggies battled back, going on a 9-2 run of their own to cut the lead to 42-41 with 6:28 to go. The Gauchos were able to answer back with a late-game run, something they have not been able to do all year. Durr put in a pair of layups to give UCSB a 50-41 lead with just 1:36 remaining, capping off a crucial 8-0 run.</p>\n<p>Unlike the last time the two teams faced each other, Davis was not able to pull off a late comeback. Santa Barbara put the game away at the line, making seven free throws in the final 53 seconds to finish with a 57-52 win.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense was up to the challenge on Saturday, forcing 21 turnovers while converting 13 points off of the Aggies’ mistakes. The Gauchos were also able to keep up with them on the boards and keep them away from the free throw line, two things they have struggled with all year. The Aggies were just 7-10 from the line while they only outrebounded UCSB 38-36.</p>\n<p>Fipps finished with a team-high 13 points and five rebounds while senior guard Kelsey Harris backed her up with 12 points and seven boards. Brance put in 10 points of her own while knocking down 2-6 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Both the Gauchos and the Aggies were able to turn their first half shooting woes around. UCSB went 13-28 from the field while Davis shot 13-29, including 6-13 from three-point range, but the difference came in the turnovers. The Gauchos turned the ball over just three times in the second half compared to eight for the Aggies.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return to Santa Barbara this Thursday to play its 2015 home finale against Hawaii.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Here are some thoughts from the series as well as what the Warriors have to do to keep the train rolling in the next round:</p>\n<p><b>The Warriors showed they could handle being down in games</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In game two, the Pelicans took a 13 point lead in the first quarter, and with starters Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green on the bench, it was the 33 year-old veteran Leandro Barbosa with his 12 points in the game who led the charge to give the team a one point lead going into halftime. Thompson and Curry took over in the second half, with the Splash Brothers amounting for 48 points total.</p>\n<p>Game three saw the Warriors go down big again, this time needing a twenty-point comeback in the fourth quarter. Curry scored 40 points in the game including a ridiculous three-pointer in the final seconds of the game where he got trampled by two Pelicans’ defenders after he fired the shot. No foul was called on the play and the game went into overtime. The Warriors took control in the extra period and went on to win 124-119.</p>\n<p><b>The Splash Brothers are awesome, but don’t forget about Draymond Green</b></p>\n<p>MVP candidate Curry had a fantastic first-round series, averaging 33.7 points per game and Thompson was right behind him with 25 points per game. Both played huge roles and were able to take turns putting the team on their shoulders with the score close and the game on the line.</p>\n<p>With these two players sharing the limelight, it’s easy to look past how big of a role Green had in the series. Averaging 12.8 rebounds per game and 2.5 steals per game, Green played a tremendous role on the defensive front. He also added 15.8 points per game, showing off his size and strength at both ends of the floor. Expect Green to play a large role in the next round as he will be asked to defend the opposing team’s top player, as he did against New Orleans’ Anthony Davis.</p>\n<p><b>Game Plan For Next Series: Keep doing what’s been working</b></p>\n<p>The Warriors will be hunted by whichever team they end up playing. It’s their job to stick to their game plan from the rest of the season. If the Warriors pass and shoot the way they have been doing it all year, I can’t imagine any team being able to beat Golden State in the second round. The Warriors will be well rested and they will have veteran forward David Lee back from a lower back injury.</p>\n<p>Expect a lot of three-balls and for the Warriors to let Curry lead the way. He can dominate any team in the league with his shooting and when doubled teamed he always has an eye for an open teammate.</p>\n<p><b>Most likely second round opponent: San Antonio Spurs</b></p>\n<p>I expect the Warriors’ opponent to be the San Antonio Spurs, and Golden State will have to hope that their series with the Los Angeles Clippers goes the full seven games in order to make the winning team as tired as possible. While they have the advantage in experience, the Spurs are not as talented as they have been in past years and they aren’t getting any younger. The Warriors are too good to lose in the second round, but expect the series to be much more of a challenge than the first one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62901\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62901\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/golden-state-looking-good-in-the-playoffs/","id":412,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[411,410,409],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Restructures Coaching Staff, Adds Two Freshmen","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB women's basketball looks to rebuild after this year's last place finish ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_63652\" style=\"width: 319px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015.03.05-StephenManga-WBBall-4-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"518146749\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63635\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63652\" data-attachment-id=\"63652\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/clair-watkins-throws-up-a-fadeaway-jump-shot-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015.03.05-StephenManga-WBBall-4-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"Stephen Manga\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Clair Watkins throws up a fadeaway jump shot.

Joining her will be two incoming freshmen, guard Caroline “Coco” Miller from JSerra Catholic High School and power forward Kali Jones from Vista Murrieta High, as well as a completely revamped assistant coaching staff.</p>\n<p>“The players have worked hard in workouts and have been welcoming as far as relationship building, and all of us have appreciated that,” Henrickson said. “Really excited about [the new staff] as well, the people that we’ve been able to bring here, their skill set and their energy.”</p>\n<p>Henrickson was announced as the team’s new head coach less than a month ago, replacing Carlene Mitchell after a four-year stint in which the Gauchos went 43-82 overall. After winning the Big West Championship back in 2011 and earning a spot in the NCAA Tournament in Mitchell’s first season with UCSB, the Gauchos’ record worsened each year. They most recently finished in last place in the conference with a mark of 2-27 overall, leading to the change which brought Henrickson to the team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The last thing I want them doing is thinking about December and January and February,” Henrickson said. “I think right now they need to focus on being better on the 21st of May than they were yesterday. As soon as you start looking ahead it can be overwhelming. We’ve just got to saw the wood, grind it out every day and try to get a little better.”</p>\n<p>Aiding Henrickson in bringing UCSB back to the top of the Big West will be the team’s only two additions on the court for next year in Miller and Jones.</p>\n<p>Standing at 5’10”, Coco Miller will be a player that UCSB can look to offensively to help improve the team’s poor shooting percentages from last year. In her junior year at JSerra Catholic, Miller averaged a double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds per game, resulting in her being named First Team All-State and First Team All-CIF. By the end of just her junior year, she had already become the school’s all-time leading scorer with 1871 points.</p>\n<p>“There’s a need for us to be able to shoot the ball better from three,” Henrickson said. “That’s exactly what she does. The kid can shoot it. Tough kid, high basketball IQ and good energy.”</p>\n<p>Helping to fill the void left by graduated senior Clair Watkins on the inside will be Kali Jones. The 6’1” power forward is a versatile weapon in the paint who averaged 16.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and nearly three blocks per game in her junior year at Chaparral High. Jones transferred to Vista Murrieta High for her senior year with the hopes of improving her game further against a higher level of competition.</p>\n<p>“She’s played some really talented kids, that’s what she was looking for. I admire those reasons that she wanted to play there,” Henrickson said. “She’s long, she’s got some size, which we need. She’s a really driven, motivated kid.”</p>\n<p>Every player on the team this past season, excluding graduated seniors Clair Watkins and Kristine Brance, is set to return to the roster in the fall. With new leadership and a fresh start, UCSB will be taking a step-by-step approach as it looks to improve heading into the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>“When you just talk about winning, there’s a lot of things you’re not having conversations about. It’s all about a process. The win is the result,” Henrickson said. “If you’re result-focused, you’re probably going to screw up the process. We will coach these young ladies up and help them get better every day.”<br>\nThe Gauchos will play their first game under Henrickson in early November.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63635\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63635\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/henrickson/","id":413,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[412,411,410],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ball Up: Post NBA Draft Insight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Assistant sports editor Sean White announces his Top 5 picks from the 2015 NBA Draft","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With NBA Free Agency in full effect, the excitement surrounding NBA headlines of the latest player signings and trades has been a wonderful start to the month of July.

His versatile skillset enables him to play on the wing or small forward position as he can defend and produce offensively on both ends of the court. Winslow’s “x-factor” role in the Blue Devils lineup was the necessary piece to their championship run. The NCAA Tournament is where he shined most as he averaged 14.3 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.7 blocks and 1.5 steals per game.</p>\n<p>While Winslow is a great slasher and on-ball defender, improving his shooting range is the next step to his NBA transition. It’s a surprise that Winslow slipped to the No. 10 spot, but the Miami Heat are smart for drafting a player of his caliber. Playing in the Eastern Conference, the Heat are already talented enough to contend for a top spot. With the return of shooting guard Dwayne Wade, forward Luol Deng, guard Goran Dragic, and a healthy power forward in Chris Bosh, Winslow could not be in a better situation that could continue his winning in college to the pros.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>D’ Angelo Russell, PG- LOS ANGELES LAKERS (OHIO STATE) </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_64270\" style=\"width: 318px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1977651289\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64263\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64270\" data-attachment-id=\"64270\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/d-loading/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1433766914\",\"copyright\":\"Los Angeles Lakers\",\"focal_length\":\"165\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"d loading\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64270\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?resize=308%2C205\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of nba.com\" width=\"308\" height=\"205\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-loading.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64270\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of nba.com</p></div>\n<p>Not even recruited by his own hometown college of Kentucky, Russell made the most of his opportunity as the lone star at Ohio State. The only Buckeye to enter this year’s draft, the Lakers’ No. 2 overall pick should not come off as a surprise.</p>\n<p>With Kobe Bryant entering what many expect to be his last season, the Lakers are hoping to win now with a team that is currently in the process of rebuilding. Drafting Russell gives Los Angeles some hope in ensuring that the Laker dynasty will not plummet to rock bottom as he entered the NBA Draft as the player with the most superstar potential. Not to mention, his outright claim of being the “best player” in this year’s draft is encouraging for a Laker team that, according to Mr. Bryant himself during a scrimmage last season, was “soft as Charmin.”</p>\n<p>For all my analytics seekers out there, Russell is one of three freshman (Danny Ainge and Kenny Anderson) in NCAA college basketball history to average 19 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists per game. While there are some complaints floating around about the lefty’s athleticism, Lakers’ fans should be proud of their front office for selecting Russell. Not only is Russell a talented player, but the opportunity to learn from a champion veteran such as Bryant is very valuable. Considering this upcoming season will likely be Kobe’s last, who knows? Maybe the “Mamba” and Russell are a good enough backcourt to help the “LakeShow” get back to its winning ways.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>SAM DEKKER, SF- HOUSTON ROCKETS (WISCONSIN)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_64271\" style=\"width: 372px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1005530131\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64263\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64271\" data-attachment-id=\"64271\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/dekker/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?fit=540%2C380&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"540,380\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dekker\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?fit=540%2C380&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64271\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?resize=362%2C255\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of usatoday.com\" width=\"362\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?w=540&amp;ssl=1 540w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dekker.jpg?resize=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of usatoday.com</p></div>\n<p>Despite a disappointing 12 point performance in the Final Four Championship game in which he shot 0 for 6 from behind the three point line, Dekker is a solid addition for the Houston Rockets. During the regular season, Houston led the NBA in three-point field goals made at 11.4 per game and attempted at 32.7. However, the Rockets’ field goal percentage from downtown suffered as they shot 34.8 percent from behind the arc. With a streaky player such as James Harden taking a majority of these three-point attempts, not being able to fully depend on players like the aging Jason Terry, Trevor Ariza, and Corey Brewer can be troubling as seen in this year’s playoffs.</p>\n<p>Dekker is known for his “let it fly” shooting style and could become that go-to guy for the Rockets. Since the departure of Chandler Parsons, Houston has yet to find a legitimate scorer other than Harden. It’s obvious that Dekker must become more of a consistent scorer in order to be effective in the Rockets’ rotation. Houston must utilize Dekker as more than a spot up three-point shooter – he has the size to put the ball on the hardwood and get to the paint.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>FRANK KAMINSKY, C- CHARLOTTE HORNETS (WISCONSIN)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_64272\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"306464614\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64263\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64272\" data-attachment-id=\"64272\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/kaminsky_3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?fit=960%2C1526&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,1526\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"KAMINSKY_3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?fit=157%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?fit=644%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64272\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?resize=190%2C302\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of charlotteobserver.com\" width=\"190\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?resize=157%2C250&amp;ssl=1 157w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KAMINSKY_3.jpg?resize=644%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 644w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64272\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of charlotteobserver.com</p></div>\n<p>They say “slow and steady wins the race,” but in today’s basketball world the one and done movement has revamped the sport of college basketball. However, Kaminsky is the prime example of a player that stayed committed to developing through a four-year process. But, it wasn’t until his junior year that “Frank the Tank” became a prominent name in the Wisconsin basketball program. His freshman and sophomore years resulted in nearly 10 minutes of play and 5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Helping lead Wisconsin to its second consecutive Final Four appearance, Kaminsky’s senior year was the best season of his collegiate career. He was the only player in Division I basketball this season to average at least 17 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 1.5 blocks per game. Kaminsky had such an outstanding year that he became the first player in Wisconsin history to win the National Player of the Year award. Charlotte’s addition of Kaminsky to its depth chart finally gives the Hornets a big that can stretch the floor, which could create more scoring opportunities for point guard Kemba Walker. While center Al Jefferson is capable of posting up on the block or knocking down some 15 to 20 feet jump shots, he does not possess the same shooting range to spread the floor like Kaminsky. Not given much credit for his niftiness when driving the ball, Kaminsky has the potential to be a stretch four as a duo with Jefferson.</p>\n<p>We all know Kaminsky has the full package, but he will need to increase his strength and build upon his frame to become more of a force in the paint. Regardless if he makes it into Charlotte’s starting lineup, Kaminsky will definitely improve the team’s offensive play as the Hornets ranked 28<sup>th</sup> out of all 30 NBA teams in offensive efficiency at 97.6 points per 100 possessions.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>DEVIN BOOKER, SG- PHOENIX SUNS (KENTUCKY)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_64273\" style=\"width: 291px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1946479072\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64263\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64273\" data-attachment-id=\"64273\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/dbook/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?fit=715%2C447&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"715,447\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dbook\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?fit=715%2C447&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64273\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?resize=281%2C176\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of kentuckysportsradio.com\" width=\"281\" height=\"176\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?w=715&amp;ssl=1 715w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dbook.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64273\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of kentuckysportsradio.com</p></div>\n<p>Considered as the best shooter in this year’s draft, Booker has a lot to offer but did not have the opportunity to showcase his full range of talent as a Wildcat. While at Kentucky, Booker’s role as sixth man was to come into games and be a spot up three-point shooter. In a year in which he averaged 10 points per game, Booker earned SEC Sixth Man of the Year honors and was elected to both the All-SEC Freshman Team and All-SEC Second Team.</p>\n<p>Many have compared Booker to Golden State shooting guard Klay Thompson. Both share pretty similar body structures concerning height and weight, but Booker also faces the same concern as when Thompson entered the league. While we all know he can shoot the ball, the Suns’ are hoping that they can make Booker more of an offensive threat by expanding his driving abilities. While guards Brandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe are the primary leaders of Phoenix’s scoring, the Suns should be able to find a way to implement Booker into their gameplan.</p>\n<p>Of course there are other draftees that could have made this Top 5 list, but when forming this class of players there is more than talent being evaluated. In addition to skill and athleticism, players assumed to have an immediate impact were chosen. Since centers Karl-Anthony Towns and Jahlil Okafor were two of the most hyped picks in this draft, placing them on this list was avoided.</p>\n<p>Regardless if the players selected to this list are busts or stars in the NBA, only time can tell. Even if some fans are not satisfied with their team’s selection, at least we can all appreciate that each year we are watching a generation of basketball players that are rejuvenating the game of professional basketball through the draft.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64263\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64263\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-07/ball-up-post-nba-draft-insight/","id":414,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[413,412,411],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
