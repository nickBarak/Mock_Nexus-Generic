Community Housing Office (CHO) deals with a lot (and I mean A LOT) of roommate conflicts every year, most resulting from people choosing their roommates in haste because of the unnecessary “housing rush” they fall into every Fall and early Winter. Get to know your roommates before signing a legally-binding, joint-and-several lease with people you barely know (or think you know but really don’t). Please take special note of this sentence: Best friends (new or old) often do not make best roommates. Take the time to figure out your rental budget and where in the community you want to live, especially since peer pressure can be very strong when it comes to making important housing decisions. Come to CHO with your potential roommates to pick up our list of roommate questions and ask CHO staff any questions you might have. We will read over your lease, help you figure out if your potential roommates are good matches, and help you brainstorm ways to tell someone you would rather not live with them (ugh!).</p>\n<p>In summary, there are more than enough rentals in Isla Vista, as well as great options in university housing, that you don’t need to rush yourself or agree to live with incompatible roommates for a price you aren’t comfortable with. Looking all through winter and spring quarter is fine, and you may even see prices drop! CHO will be doing a series of programs in mid-January in the residence halls that will address everything you need to know about making the best choice for you. Don’t get caught up in the hype; there are way too many choices to consider before signing on the dotted line!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>What is the legality of hanging out on our IV rooftop? Can our landlords kick us off (or out)?</p>\n<p>Property providers are not trying to ruin your chance to see the Isla Vista sunset from a great spot or sun yourself high in the sky by disallowing you to hang out on the roof. They are protecting you (from falling off) and protecting themselves (from you falling off and suing them and damaging the roof itself). Rooftops are not meant to be used as social gathering places (they can’t handle a lot of foot traffic or weight) so it is appropriate for a landlord or property manager to include in their lease that this is disallowed. Your property provider (or the police!) can certainly give you a warning or two to stop the behavior, as it is a breach of your contract (and dangerous). If the behavior is continued, they could potentially give you a 3-day notice for breach of contract if the violation is substantial enough or charge you for damages caused by you and your lawn chair. Don’t risk your life and limbs or your lease — there are so many other beautiful places meant for gathering and sunbathing in Isla Vista and the surrounding Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How many bugs are too many bugs? Our house has lots of crawlers but we don’t want to go through the hassle of getting it tented unless it’s totally necessary.</p>\n<p>First of all, make sure your house is clean and your stuff is put away since bugs are drawn to trash and leftover smelly food (plus, this is one of your responsibilities in keeping your rental habitable!). Secondly, use bug spray in and around your rental where you see bugs. If you notice an obvious hole or crevice where they are coming in or don’t have a screen covering your windows, submit a written maintenance request to your landlord for repairs. If all your attempts at keeping your rental clean and bug-free fail, submit a note to your landlord requesting they check out the buggy situation. You are entitled, according to California Civil Code section 1941.1, to “clean and sanitary buildings, grounds and appurtenances (for example, a garden or detached garage), free from debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin.” Your property provider may need to send over an exterminator or maintenance person to see where the creepy-crawlies are finding their way in and spray with stronger chemicals. The cleaner your house is when this happens, the better, so that the property manager doesn’t try to hold you responsible. Typically a place won’t get tented unless the situation is really bad or many apartments have bugs and individual extermination treatments aren’t working.

How does that figure compare to university-owned housing or downtown apartment complexes?</p>\n<p>We tell students to expect to spend $600-$700 to share a double room in Isla Vista; however, I’ve heard of students spending as low as $425 and as much as $950 for a double. Rental amounts depend on a number of factors (location, included utilities, laundry, parking, age of building, amenities, property provider, etc.). Prices for university-owned apartments tend to be below market value compared to Isla Vista (from $533-$716) and include all utilities, furnishings and 9-month contracts. Additionally, the security deposit for the university apartments is $150. UCSB Residence Halls are well-priced considering the meals, housekeeping, grounds, convenience, security, programming, utilities, furnishings, 9-month contract and requiring no security deposit. A little known fact: based on UCSB Financial Aid estimated budgets, if you live in the residence halls for your first two years, then in UCSB-owned apartments, you will spend less at the end of your four-year stay than if you were to live in the res halls your first year and I.V. the remaining three years!</p>\n<p>Although the prices of studios ($900-$1,100) and one-bedroom apartments ($1,100-$1,400) don’t vary that much from Isla Vista to Goleta or downtown, it is the two-bedroom places where you notice the biggest difference. Two-bedroom apartments in Isla Vista typically are priced to house four people, so if you consider each person is paying about $650, you find an average price of $2600. Average two-bedrooms in Goleta or downtown are priced anywhere from $1400-$2200, depending on all the extras and whether it is an apartment, duplex or house. Security deposits for rentals in Isla Vista, Goleta and Santa Barbara can set you and your apartment-mates back up to two times the amount of rent for an unfurnished rental and up to three times for a furnished rental.</p>\n<p><em>Maya Salmon is Program Coordinator for UCSB’s CHO.</em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>Questions about mold?

Her friends invited us, too.”</p>\n<p>“Um … Um, okay come in quickly, but no more of you.”</p>\n<p>Fast forward to Saturday night: You are walking down Sabado in costume with a close friend. You pass a house with a few guys sitting on the porch.</p>\n<p>“Hey, look guys, it’s gay dudes,” they yell.</p>\n<p>You ignore them.</p>\n<p>“Hey, we are talking to you. Yeah, you two. Fucking fags.”</p>\n<p>What do you do? Do you get angry and respond? Do you continue to ignore them? What if you ignore them and it only angers them more? What if they leave their porch, and approach you to start a fight? Or do you say something? Do you flick them off? What if you do and that, too, angers them, causing them to get up and attack you? Or do you just walk away quickly? Or run?</p>\n<p>These are real experiences that I witnessed and had in Isla Vista this weekend. And I am not alone. And it is not only during Halloween that these types of things happen. And it is not only against gay-identified males. And it is not okay.</p>\n<p>I am proud of my sexuality. Being called a “fucking fag” was painful and angering but not life threatening at that time. I avoided physical contact, brushed off the words and moved on with my night. And I had a great night.</p>\n<p>But there are those at UCSB who struggle with their gender, sexuality and identity every single day. There are people who do not have the privilege of being proud like me. People who are “in the closet,” not because they are not courageous, but because staying in the closet is a matter of survival. Because they are in a fraternity and are afraid to isolate themselves from their heterosexual frat brothers. Because if their parents find out, they would stop paying for tuition. Because if they stand up for themselves, they could have their asses beaten by a bunch of drunk guys in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Homophobia is very real in our community. It is not wise to simply write these situations off as minor incidents. There are many that go unreported. There are those who may feel like sharing a hate-crime incident that they endured could “out” them. Or cause more violence against them.</p>\n<p>But I, frankly, have had enough. Today, it is a few hateful words. Tomorrow, it is violence against another student. Or possibly, those homophobic slurs could trigger someone to hurt themselves.</p>\n<p>It’s time the larger UCSB population came together to propose solutions to stop homophobia. We are a beautiful, educated and broad-minded community.

But what haven’t you heard? (Besides the obvious conservative argument, of course.) Where’s all the discussion on Prop 34? Perhaps it’s the fact that the economy trumps all other talking points thanks to our current financial predicament, or that we’re facing the closest presidential election since 2000 which causes us to forget that the death penalty is even on the ballot this year.</p>\n<p>For the unfamiliar, Prop 34 would replace California’s capital punishment statute with life in prison with no parole, applying retroactively to all 725 convicts on death row. The principle argument thus far has been that abolishing the death penalty would eliminate between $100 and $130 million in funding for trials and appeals that could be better spent investigating unsolved violent crimes. At a time when the state is scrambling to support its own public schools, you would think that $130 million is an attractive enough sum to garner support for a measure that would have no adverse effects on the large majority of Americans. Yet its support hovers around 38 percent.</p>\n<p>Having focused on the financial benefit of Prop 34, its advocates have allowed the issue to become framed as a choice between money and justice. But the death penalty is hardly so black and white. As the old cliché goes, two wrongs don’t make a right. Killing the offender doesn’t undo his crime, it only adds to the body count. Once in custody, the criminal cannot cause any more harm. It ceases to be a matter of justice and becomes one of revenge — and that’s assuming that the convict is guilty.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Since 1992, more than 15 death row inmates have been proven not guilty due to newly released DNA evidence. Sadly, DNA evidence isn’t always available, leaving some to be convicted without sufficient evidence. Execution robs convicts of the eventual possibility of acquittal based on later evidence. If justice is better late than never, a life sentence should be the obvious choice.</p>\n<p>Some have argued that the death penalty saves lives in the long run by preventing repeat offenses, but a life sentence without parole would accomplish the same goal. Beyond that, the idea of only receiving a life sentence is hardly an encouraging thought in the mind of a potential offender. There would be no discernible increase in crime due to the lessening of penalty. Take Europe, for example. All but Belarus have outlawed capital punishment, and the European Union requires its abolition for membership. Of the 39 EU member and candidate states, only Estonia and Lithuania were above the United States’ homicide rate of 5.4 per 100,000 people between 2007 and 2009, whereas most were far below that.</p>\n<p>“But wait!” you might say. “Our prisons are already overloaded. It’s far more efficient to rid ourselves of the worst offenders so we can focus on the others.” Efficiency? Consider this: There are 725 criminals currently on death row in California. Due to lengthy appeal processes and an imposed moratorium, only 13 people have been executed since the death penalty was reinstated in 1978. At its core, death row is already a life imprisonment, albeit it a far costlier one. The system isn’t just inefficient, it’s ineffective, unjust, costly, and above all, immoral. It’s time we abandoned Hammurabi’s Code and joined the rest of civilized society in ending the death penalty.</p>\n<p><em>Daniel Slovinsky is a third-year communication major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

I supported 37 in part because I was fed up with watching big businesses successfully slander good propositions. Two years ago, big alcohol (not wanting to have to compete with marijuana for your intoxication) funded all those commercials trashing the integrity of hardworking California physicians like my dad by suggesting that they’d come to work stoned if Prop 19 passed. Last June, big tobacco was responsible for steamrolling to death Prop 29 (the tax on cigarettes for cancer research, if you’ll remember) with confusing and misleading propaganda. The sociopathic behemoths of tobacco who make their fortunes poisoning people thought we would be stupid enough to listen to them.</p>\n<p>Only we were. And although I had higher hopes for Prop 37, it seems the people of California were once again duped into voting against their best interest. Only a month before the election, Prop 37 was leading in a landslide. Before the propaganda storm began, California voters knew that it was a good measure. Nobody was trying to ban GMOs. We only wanted the same labeling standards that Europe and China demand of their corporations. But once multinational agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto started up the propaganda machine, people began to change their minds, and Prop 37 was narrowly defeated by voters on Election Day.</p>\n<p>They had to go out on a limb to destroy this one, though. Prop 37 was as near-perfect as legislation can be, and the extreme silliness of the ‘No’ campaign proves it. Although they made an issue of “exemptions,” food in restaurants is never labeled. (If 37 had required labeling of GM restaurant foods, you can bet the ‘No’ campaign would have been whining instead about inconsistency.) And the assertion that Prop 37 would cost consumers four hundred dollars a year was an outright lie, originating with the anti-recycling firm Northbridge Consulting. An independent economic analysis done by Joanna Shepherd-Bailey, Ph.D. of the Emory University School of Law found that there would have been no costs to consumers.</p>\n<p>So, are GMOs actually dangerous? I’d say the jury’s still out. Good information on the safety of GMOs is hard to find, in part because much of the info available has been corrupted by corporate money. (Conveniently, labeling GMOs would have made studying their effects on humans much easier.) According to the FDA, the deputy commissioner of which is a former Monsanto lawyer, GMOs are safe. Sounds perfectly legit to me.</p>\n<p>It should be clear to us all by now that the only “badly worded” part of Prop 37 involved the words “right to know.” No law with those words will ever pass the Monsanto acid test.</p>\n<p>Some would argue that the general public is too gullible and easily frightened by talk of “Frankenfoods” to be trusted with hefty decisions about what to put in our own bodies.  But with GMOs shrouded in secrecy, what else should one expect? Maybe if corporations were straightforward and honest with the public for a change, we might be a little less suspicious. Don’t expect us to implicitly trust you, Monsanto, not after you and your cohorts just spent 50 million dollars to keep us in the dark. Prove yourselves. Don’t hide if you have nothing to fear.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 6, California chose to relinquish its choice. A sinister and litigious corporation succeeded in convincing us of our own stupidity and incompetence. In the process, a great blow was struck against the free market. Consumers must be able to make real, informed choices for the “invisible hand” to work properly. If Prop 37 had passed, we all would have been able to walk into grocery stores, look at the labels on food packages and know for sure what we were eating. It would have been empowering. We had our chance, and we opted for powerlessness.</p>\n<p>California, you blew it again. Enjoy your GMOs.
