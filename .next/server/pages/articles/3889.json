The deputies roused the man from his drunken stupor and assisted him to his feet.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the sidewalk sleeper if he knew where he was and he told them he was in front of Manzanita Village. A deputy directed his attention to the large academic building behind him and again asked the man to describe his surroundings, but the 19-year-old adamantly assured the deputies they were at Manzanita Village and that the offices in Ellison were in fact dorm rooms.</p>\n<p>The severely confused individual then told officers that he lived on Camino Pescadero, that it was just a short walk from Manzanita and that they should just let him walk home. Officers told him he was not close to Camino Pescadero and, despite assuring officers he was, asked if he could call his roommate to walk him home.</p>\n<p>The deputies said he could and he proceeded to reach for his phone. His phone, however, was not there and the still intoxicated man became confused and looked to the officer to ask if he had his cell phone.</p>\n<p>The deputy told him he did not have his cell phone, and instead arrested the young man for public intoxication. He was then transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Mon., Oct 27, 4:11 a.m. — At approximately 4:01 a.m., deputies received a report of an intoxicated man trying to gain entry into a house on the 6700 block of Pasado Road.</p>\n<p>The concerned residents told dispatch that the man had begun by repeatedly slamming his body into their sliding glass door, and when that proved ineffective, had moved around to the front door and was banging incessantly trying to gain entry.</p>\n<p>When deputies arrived 10 minutes later, they witnessed the heavy set 28-year-old man square up to the front door, push himself forward and, with considerable force, slam the entirety of his excessive weight against the wooden door.</p>\n<p>Despite the man’s sincerest and drunkest efforts, however, the door did not budge.</p>\n<p>The deputies contacted the man and told him to stop throwing himself at the door, which he did. The officers then asked the man — who, incidentally, works for KjEE FM in Santa Barbara — why he was trying to get inside in the residence.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the heavily intoxicated male did not have an answer to this question. In fact, he could not say where he was, how he had come to be in Isla Vista to begin with, or whose house he was attempting to enter.</p>\n<p>All he could say for sure was that he had consumed between five and eight beers that night.</p>\n<p>That was enough for the deputies, though, who arrested the man for public intoxication and allowed him unobstructed entrance into the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>— Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-30/police-blotter-31/","id":3889,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3888,3887,3886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[3362,3538,3539,3541,3553,3570,3697,3843,3844,3845,3846,3847,3848,3849,3850,3851,3852,3862,3871,3872,3873,3874,3875,3879,3880,3881,3882,3885,3886,3888,3889,3892,3893,3894,3896,3897],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-09-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A deputy on patrol at the intersection of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive was rudely interrupted while talking with a pedestrian.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Biker’s Blues<br>\nSat., Sept. 6, 12:30 a.m. – A deputy on patrol at the intersection of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive was rudely interrupted while talking with a pedestrian.</p>\n<p>The officer was busy with an unrelated contact when a young man on a bike came barreling out of nowhere and ran directly into him. Not surprisingly, the 19-year-old possessed many of the symptoms of heavy intoxication.</p>\n<p>The deputy, relatively unscathed from his run-in with the bike, immediately told the reckless rider to park it on the curb, but the young man would not. After several attempts at ordering him to sit down, the officer had to physically assist him to the curb.</p>\n<p>After finally succeeding in seating the BMX bomber, the deputy was able to assess the situation. He first noticed that the young man was not wearing a shoe on his right foot, a sign of having too much to drink.</p>\n<p>The young man told the officer he had taken three shots earlier in the night, but after failing to complete his ABC’s, he was arrested for public intoxication. In response, the recently arrested cyclist repeatedly told the deputy that he had just been trying to get home and that everything was an “accident.”</p>\n<p>Accident or not, crashing into a police officer while riding a bike is never going to turn out well, and in this case the young man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Where Did You Sleep Last Night?<br>\nSun., Sept. 7, 6:47 a.m.-Deputies working the morning shift received a call concerning a young man passed out on a sidewalk near the intersection of Camino Pescadero and El Greco roads.</p>\n<p>Two officers responded to the call and immediately found the 18-year-old sleeping peacefully on the concrete. He was fully dressed, but the fresh morning light revealed that his t-shirt was covered in what appeared to be his own vomit.</p>\n<p>One of the deputies walked up to the sidewalk sleeper and said, “Police, wake up,” in a low, police-like voice, but the sleeping beauty did not rouse. However, after a little shaking, the young man eventually sat up.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the severely confused man if he knew where he was, but he simply looked up at the deputy with a blank stare on his face.</p>\n<p>The deputy then asked if he knew where he lived, and he responded by saying he lived on “DP.” When asked where on Del Playa, he just shrugged his shoulders and did not respond.</p>\n<p>The SBCC student was then asked if he had too much to drink the night before and he, as anyone who wakes up on a sidewalk should, nodded his head in agreement.</p>\n<p>“Would you like to go to jail?” asked the deputy, and the young man once again nodded his head in agreement. Not wishing to disappoint, the officer arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Breaking and Entering (and Sleeping?)<br>\nMon., Sept. 15, 5:14 a.m.-A deputy was dispatched to 6661 Berkshire Terrace on a report of an intoxicated male trying to unlawfully gain entry into an apartment.</p>\n<p>When the officer arrived he contacted a resident of the apartment, who said that she had been sleeping on the living room couch when an unidentified male climbed through the front window and “passed out” on the floor. When asked if she knew the squatter, she said “no” and that she wanted him gone.</p>\n<p>The deputy walked into the apartment and saw the 21-year-old UCSB student fast asleep on the living room floor. He had on a collared shirt, a pair of underwear and nothing else. His pants were soaking wet with what no doubt was his own urine, and his shoes were laying haphazardly on the kitchen floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy shook the young man awake, but he was too disoriented to cooperate. He did not know where he was, or where he lived. When he tried to stand, he nearly fell over.</p>\n<p>The officer told the floor moocher that he was not welcome there, and the confused man walked to his pants and attempted to put the urine soaked denim back on, but was unable to and instead placed them back down on the floor.</p>\n<p>The deputy again told him that he was not wanted, but the piss-soaked sleeper mumbled something incoherent and continued to walk aimlessly around the living room.</p>\n<p>Clearly incapable of taking care of himself, he was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>-Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-18/police-blotter-28/","id":3886,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3885,3884,3883],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Friday, Sept. 19, 11:14 p.m. - A man walking by a house at the corner of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive suddenly lost his balance and face-planted on the sidewalk, catching the eye of a patrolling...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Watch Your Step</b><br>\nFriday, Sept. 19, 11:14 p.m. – A man walking by a house at the corner of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive suddenly lost his balance and face-planted on the sidewalk, catching the eye of a patrolling officer.</p>\n<p>The deputy went to check on the well-being of the 19-year-old and immediately noticed the strong odor of alcohol emanating from his person. The not-so-sure-footed partier had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, and his clothes were soiled in what appeared to be his own bodily fluids.</p>\n<p>As the deputy spoke with the now-seated man, he began to vomit vigorously. After he was done regurgitating his dinner, he slumped over to the side, almost landed in his own pile of vomit, and fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>The officer awoke the sickly man and continued questioning him, making sure not to step in the puddle of sick.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the man what he had been drinking, and not surprisingly, the young man stated, “Tequila.”</p>\n<p>Having heard all he needed to hear, the officer arrested the young man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Marking Your Territory</b><br>\nFriday, Sept. 19, 11:20 p.m. – Officers poking around a Del Playa parking lot came across a young man defacing a stranger’s vehicle.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the 19-year-old UCSB student pulled down his zipper, whipped it out and began urinating on the side of a minivan. He was, however, too drunk to keep his balance and had to use the minivan for support as he relieved himself.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even with the van’s steady support, standing tall was just too difficult and the perp stumbled to the side and started peeing on his own leg.</p>\n<p>An officer walked up behind the man and told him to “zip it up.” Caught red-handed, the young man turned around and still tried to play it cool, telling the officer he hadn’t been urinating.</p>\n<p>His zipper was still down, however, and the officer told him once more to zip it up, which he eventually did. The deputy then began to question the young man, but he proved to be uncooperative.</p>\n<p>Judging that the man was unable to care for himself, the officer arrested the young pisser and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Deaf, Dumb and Blind</b><br>\nSat. Sept. 20, 12:14 a.m. – An SBCC student walking west down Del Playa Drive caught the attention of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>Acting as if he were a human pinball and Del Playa was his alcohol-themed pinball machine, the 20-year-old man was bumping into people left and right as he attempted to navigate the busy street. He had with him a female escort, but not even a pinball wizard could have controlled his reckless walking.</p>\n<p>Then the unsteady stroller bumped into the wrong man, who got up in his face and started shouting. The deputies hastened towards the intoxicated man, hoping to get to him before he got himself into real trouble.</p>\n<p>The officers reached the young man and told him to sit down on the curb, which he did, and started asking him for his information. Due to his level of intoxication, however, he proved difficult to talk to. His speech was so slurred the deputy had to ask him to repeat answers several times before he could comprehend what he was trying to saying.</p>\n<p>He told the officers he had been drinking at a friend’s house and was heading to another friend’s house. Isla Vista’s Finest were forced to disagree, however, and arrested the man right there.

Her escort agreed and quickly left the scene.</p>\n<p>Without the help of her supposed friend, the 18-year-old out-of-towner was unable to maintain her balance and started to dry heave.</p>\n<p>Before the officer could assist the unsteady gal, she began to dry heave so violently that she fell to the ground. Once on the pavement, her dry heaving turned to actual vomiting and the shit hit the fan; she threw up in her hair, on her clothes and all over her legs and feet.</p>\n<p>After she was done upchucking her dinner, lunch and breakfast, the deputy asked her how much she had to drink that night, and she replied with, “I’m good.” Then she told the officer that she was having trouble seeing things.</p>\n<p>After five minutes of sitting on the curb, the officer asked if she could walk.

She was then asked where she was heading, and she replied her sorority.</p>\n<p>When asked how much she had had to drink, she said, “Enough.” After speaking with her friend, the officers learned that they had come from the Phi Sig fraternity house, where the various sororities had been competing in a “gladiator style” sporting event.</p>\n<p>She was arrested and transported to the Isla Vista sub-station on Trigo Road. There she was placed on a chair in the holding cell, but after a half-hour of repeatedly falling off she was moved to the floor.</p>\n<p>Her intoxication seemed to be increasing, and at times she lost consciousness. Then, she began to urinate, soaking her shorts and the ground that she was sitting on. She made no attempt to move and ultimately passed out in a puddle of her own urine.</p>\n<p>The sorority girl was then transported to the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for alcohol overdose, but was ultimately released back to the Sheriff’s Dept. and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>–Compiled by Travis Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17442\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17442\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-10-17/police-blotter-30/","id":3888,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3887,3886,3885],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
