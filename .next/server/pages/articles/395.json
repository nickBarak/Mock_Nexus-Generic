While it was a satisfactory performance by the Gauchos’ starting unit, scoring 24 points on 7-of-23 shooting from the field, it was a spectacular game for UCSB’s supporting cast off the bench.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s bench scored a total of 43 points. Leading the Gauchos’ group of reserves was freshman forward Kali Jones. In her collegiate debut, Jones sunk 11-of-12 shot attempts for a field goal percentage of 90 percent, scored 22 points and snagged a game-high eight rebounds in 29 minutes of play.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66250\" style=\"width: 196px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1317373167\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66288\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66250\" data-attachment-id=\"66250\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/promising-start-with-henrickson-at-the-helm-ucsb-nearly-forces-ot-in-70-67-exhibition-loss-vs-csudh/dioseline-lopez-moves-the-ball-down-the-court-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WBasketbVS.CSDominguez-20151108-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 6D\",\"caption\":\"Dioseline Lopez moves the ball down the court.

We did that too much and were kind of sloppy, we just have to be more discipline and fundamental.”</p>\n<p>The Toros were small in the paint and UCSB made sure it dominated. At six feet two inches, Jones capitalized on CSUDH’s lack of size in the front court, posting-up and backing down defenders for quick turnaround layups.</p>\n<p>In order to improve its interior defense, Dominguez Hills switched between a full-court press and 2-3 zone. While Jones periodically scored some baskets down low, the Toros’ defensive adjustment was beneficial. It forced UCSB to shoot from the perimeter, an unsuccessful aspect of the Gauchos’ shot selection. Santa Barbara shot 25 percent from long distance, going 4-of-16 from behind the three.</p>\n<p>“It pushed us out wide,” Henrickson said. “We needed to be able to go downhill and instead of playing it East-West, our zone offense needed to go North-South. It was a zone, but their [Dominguez Hills] ball pressure felt like man.”</p>\n<p>Eventually the “small ball” lineup of Dominguez Hills prevailed, outscoring UCSB 20-12 in the third quarter. With 2:09 left in the period, CSUDH went on an 8-2 run to take a 56-49 lead to head into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Knocking down one of the two three-point field goals during the Toros’ run was senior guard Breanna Garcia. The score was the stimulus to her four consecutive baskets in the fourth quarter’s opening. Her scoring rally helped CSUDH take a 10-point, 65-55 lead with 06:12 left in regulation. Garcia ended with a game-high 24 points on a 10-of-16 shooting afternoon.</p>\n<p>With 4:58 remaining in the fourth quarter, junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe drained a clutch three-pointer to establish the Gauchos’ comeback surge. She registered six points while finishing with a game-high of nine assists, tying her career-high.</p>\n<p>A jumpshot by freshman guard CoCo Miller continued Santa Barbara’s come-from-behind attempt. Despite picking up three early fouls, limiting her to 19 minutes, Miller shot four-of-five for 12 points. The scores helped spark UCSB’s 10-2 run, trimming CSUDH’s lead to 65-67.</p>\n<p>A missed three-point attempt by Toros’ junior guard Imari Brown set UCSB up with its last attempt at either a win or tie.</p>\n<p>As UCSB looked for Jones in the paint for the game-tying bucket, the Toros’ defense forced senior shooting guard Jasmine Ware to settle for a missed three-pointer with 41 seconds left in the game.</p>\n<p>The missed attempt led to the Gauchos having to intentionally foul, sending Dominguez Hills to the free throw line. A missed free throw by Dominguez Hills’ redshirt junior guard Femi Hamilton kept UCSB within three, down 65-68.</p>\n<p>A timeout helped give Santa Barbara time to draw up a play that freed up Jones in the paint for an easy layup that cut the Toros’ lead to one at 68-67.</p>\n<p>Another UCSB foul placed senior guard Monay Lee at the free throw line as she made both to give Dominguez Hills a 70-67 lead. She finished with 16 points and two steals. The Toros sunk 69.2 percent of their free throws, making 18-of-26.</p>\n<p>With no timeouts and five seconds remaining, it left UCSB with no other option than to go for the game-tying three. Unable to find Jemerigbe, Ware or Miller for the last shot, junior forward Mi’Chael Wright ended up taking the three-point attempt that bounced off the cylinder of the rim and resulted in the Gauchos’ 70-67 loss.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s bench outscored its starting lineup, Henrickson knows that it is going to take more than scoring for the Gauchos to earn victories.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have favorites,” Henrickson said. “At the end of the day, it’s about production. Be a better screener, weak side help, spread the floor, defensive transition, be a better rebounder on both ends of the floor. Most people think it’s about scoring, it’s not. Think about all the ways you can win a game that require no talent.

The reigning Big West Athlete of the Week is coming off back-to-back career performances.</p>\n<p>Scoring a career-high 22 points in last Saturday’s victory over UCR, Porter had another outstanding performance in the Gauchos’ most recent win against LBSU Thursday night as she earned her first career double-double with 17 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ leading scorer since the start of conference play, averaging 14.8 points per game, Porter has been most effective from behind the three-point line. During UCSB’s winning streak, she has made at least three shots from behind the perimeter in three-straight games, and is averaging a three-point percentage of 45 percent.</p>\n<p>She is currently tied with fellow Gaucho sophomore guard Coco Miller for third in the Big West in both three-point makes per game and total threes made at a 2.2 average and 38 apiece, respectively.</p>\n<p>Providing a lift on both offense and defense when coming off the bench continues to be redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>In the team’s previous game she tied her career-high of 14 points. Possessing the ability to penetrate and drive to the basket or kick the ball out to shooters, Toler leads the Big West in assists per 40 minutes with a 7.7 average and is tied for third with a 4.3 average per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the aftermath of five seniors departing continues to affect Hawaii as its young core of seven freshman and five sophomores continues to learn their roles on the court.</p>\n<p>A graduating class that included impact players such as leading scorer Destiny King and its leading three-point shooter for three-straight seasons in Ashleigh Karaitiana, Hawaii has struggled thus far this season.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine rank last in the Big West in scoring, averaging 58.1 points per game and are second to last at eighth in three-point shooting percentage at 28.1.</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s subpar averages, leading the Rainbow Wahine in a majority of their games has been the team’s only upperclassmen and backcourt duo senior point guard Briana Harris and junior guard Sarah Toeaina.</p>\n<p>Toeaina serves as Hawaii’s leading scorer at 12.3 points per game, while Harris is the runner up at 10.8 per contest. In the team’s win over Cal Poly Thursday night, the two guards combined for 47 points to bolster the Rainbow Wahine’s season-high field goal finish of 57 percent.</p>\n<p>Pacing Hawaii’s great shooting night was Harris, who matched her career-high of 24 points and Toeaina, who finished with 23 points and a career-high six assists.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii has struggled shooting from beyond the arc, it has been exceptional in defending the long range shot as it leads the Big West in three-point defense with a 26.3 average, ranking just ahead of UCSB at second with a 28.3 average.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos have allowed the least amount of total three-point makes in the conference at 68-of-240 in comparison to Hawaii’s second-place standing of 92-of-350.</p>\n<p>With both teams presenting stout defense along the perimeter, it could be expected that both programs attempt to score most of their points in the paint in hopes of sucking in the defense to create opportunities along the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Hawaii will tip-off today at 4 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75047\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75047\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/","id":392,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[391,390,389],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jemerigbe’s Game-Winning Layup Earns UCSB’s First Win of Season in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/02.21.15ChristinaDeMarzoWomensBBall1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/02.21.15ChristinaDeMarzoWomensBBall1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe scored the game-winning layup to propel the UCSB women's basketball team to its first win of the season, 61-60 over Cal State Bakersfield on Thursday night.

A total of four Gauchos scored in double figures as the team shot 47.2 percent from the field, 33.3 percent from beyond the arc but had a season-high 26 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“You find a way to win because you get stops,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “When it’s a one-possession game, everything matters. Sometimes as coaches you draw plays and sometimes you have to go make a play, and she [Jemerigbe] made a play.”</p>\n<p>The come-from-behind win improves UCSB’s overall record to 1-2 while the Roadrunners remain winless at 0-2.</p>\n<p>From the game’s beginning, it was Jones with the hot hand, scoring eight of her 13 points on 4-4 shooting in the first quarter. She finished with her first double-double of the season, adding 16 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Bakersfield showed its willingness to shoot the three-point ball early, making 3-6 shots from long distance. A late make from beyond the arc by redshirt junior forward Erika Williams with 19 seconds left captured CSUB’s 15-14 lead to close the quarter.</p>\n<p>Williams was the Roadrunners’ second-leading scorer with 13 points and shot 4-7 from long distance on the night. Overall, CSUB shot 43.8 percent from deep, making 7-16 attempts.</p>\n<p>A total of four lead changes occurred in the second quarter as both teams traded points. However, Bakersfield’s defense managed to limit Jones to just two shot attempts in the quarter, restraining her to one attempt from the field in the entirety of the second half.</p>\n<p>Ending the back-and-forth scoring was a three-pointer by CSUB freshman guard Addi Walters. The perimeter shot was the spark to the Roadrunners’ 11-3 run, resulting in their largest lead of the game at 35-29 to enter halftime.</p>\n<p>Scoring the first points in the second half was a three-point basket by UCSB sophomore guard Makala Roper. Despite a 0-2 shooting performance in the first quarter, she tied Jones for the team lead in points with 13. A reserve off the bench, she finished the game shooting 50 percent from the field and behind the three.</p>\n<p>However, Bakersfield’s ability to restrain UCSB’s plan to feed Jones in the paint eventually led to the emergence of senior forward Batabe Zempare.</p>\n<p>Held to two points on 1-5 shooting in the first half, Zempare scored the Roadrunners’ first field goal of the third quarter. The score prompted Cal State Bakersfield’s 8-0 run which resulted in its 11-point lead of 47-36.</p>\n<p>Zempare would go off for 10 points in the fourth quarter and finished with a game-high 16 points. While her late scoring rally helped keep CSUB in the game, the Gauchos’ Jones did not believe she had lost the battle in the paint.</p>\n<p>“It was easy,” Jones said when asked about the matchup with the senior forward. “But the second half, she did start slipping the screens. I just started focusing on getting offensive rebounds and put backs.”</p>\n<p>Guiding UCSB’s comeback was the scoring outburst of freshman guard CoCo Miller. Scoreless in the first half, she erupted for all 10 of her points in the second half. She was responsible for seven points during the Gauchos’ 14-4 run.</p>\n<p>“She [Miller] got two layups, hit a three and stopped trying to pass it to everybody,” Henrickson said. “She’s a confident kid, she can shoot it.”</p>\n<p>Providing some valuable minutes off the bench was sophomore small forward Taylor Farris as she recorded a game-high four blocks. Santa Barbara’s defense held Bakersfield to a 38.2 shooting percentage and tallied a season-high 10 steals.</p>\n<p>A pair of made free throws by Zempare helped CSUB take a 56-53 lead but a clutch three-pointer by Jemerigbe was the equalizer to force the 56-56 tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended up taking a 59-58 lead after a layup by Roper but were caught inattentively on defense by a backdoor cut and layup by Zempare to hand the Roadrunners a 60-59 lead.</p>\n<p>Due to the new NCAA rule that permits the advancement of the ball to halfcourt after a timeout is called and a score has been made with under a minute remaining, UCSB was able to call a timeout to set up the inbound pass to Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 26 turnovers, UCSB outrebounded CSUB 43-24 and outscored the Roadrunners’ bench 28-15.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is right back on the road at Oregon this Sunday, Nov. 22. Tip-off will be at 12:00 p.m. in Matthew Knight Arena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

from San Francisco State in its season-opening exhibition last night in the Thunderdome. Senior guards John Green and Michael Bryson both hit the 20-point mark as the Gauchos nearly doubled the Gators’ scoring totals in the final 20 minutes on their way to a 66-45 win.</p>\n<p>Green’s impressive stat line also included 12 rebounds and an efficient 9-14 shooting from the field. He was one of three starters to knock down a pair of three-pointers on the night, along with Bryson and freshman guard Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>After a slow start for UCSB, which trailed 4-0 several minutes into the game, a three-pointer from Vincent began a 14-0 run for the Gauchos as they took control of the lead for the remainder of the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a layup by Green at the 6:35 mark gave Santa Barbara an 18-10 lead, the Gators responded well, going on an 11-4 run to cut the deficit to just one point.
