The bluff-side seats provided a panoramic view of the contestants in the water.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First place went to James Burns, fourth-year financial mathematics and statistics major, because he was able to “get his feet on the nose of his board in every heat,” according to Benny Drescher, head organizer of the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Like in any surf contest, James won because he picked the right board for the day – a longboard, that is – and caught the best waves in each heat,” Drescher said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four judges scored the performances of each surfer. With each new round, the judges would drop the lowest-scoring surfers from the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They judge you on style, like if you fall or do something really well,” said Axel Eaton, fourth-year environmental studies major and competition contestant. “It’s subjective, but it’s the nature of the sport.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teams representing Greek houses joined in the competition, and each house donated a sum of money as part of their philanthropy efforts. Organizers also accepted donations from non-surfers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The competition raised $230 from contestant entry fees and general donations. Individual entries were $8 per person and $35 for teams of five. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proceeds from the contest will go toward the I.V. Surfrider’s campaign to distribute reusable party cups made entirely of recycled plastic. Some of the donations will also be sent to the Rainforest Action Network to benefit their Climate Action Fund.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want to do with our campaign is minimize the waste of red solo cups by replacing them with the reusable ones,” judge Marcus Vicari and current I.V. Surfrider president said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers hope to get a bulk order of the cups to distribute to the contestants who can then document how much they have used the cups, Vicari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefit competition is partly in response to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the middle of the Pacific Ocean that contains millions of pieces of polluting plastic, he said. The initiative stems from their “Rise Above Plastics” campaign that strives to help bring an end to single-use plastics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Surfrider foundation was founded on the thought to keep oceans clean and open to the public,” judge Zach Georgii of the San Luis Obispo Surfriders chapter said. “No person should be able to own a part of the ocean, and nobody should be polluting our waters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are also trying to get local restaurants in I.V. and Goleta to stop using single-use plastics in their “ocean friendly restaurants campaign.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. Surfrider chapter also hosts beach clean-up days throughout the year in its efforts to keep local waters clean. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

class=\"wp-caption-text\">A row of revelers sit on a stone wall in front of a chain-link fence on Del Playa Drive during Deltopia on Saturday, April 5, 2014. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>“We’re actually no longer doing that this year. I think that’s going to help really create a more welcoming vibe for campus,” Jayne Reimel, assistant director for the Visitor Center and Spring Insight organizer, said.</p>\n<p>According to Sgt. Rob Romero, a UCPD spokesperson, smaller Deltopia crowds and Spring Insight will contribute to the decrease in fencing. Romero said UCPD currently plans to remove all the fencing along El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>“What we’re trying to do is scale back the police presence, scale back the fencing,” he said in an email. “We’re trying to make this a more welcoming community during that time, but still making sure that we have enough police presence there in case anything does end up getting out of hand.”</p>\n<p>Spring Insight, a day when admitted prospective students are encouraged to visit campus, typically occurs on the second week of April, and Deltopia occurs on the first weekend back from Spring Break. Coincidentally, both events will occur at the same time this year.</p>\n<p>Reimel said Spring Insight planners considered the admission decision release date and Easter holiday when scheduling the event.</p>\n<p>“We actually plan Spring Insight dates years in advance,” she said. “So we typically do them in chunks of three, four, five years at a time so this date has actually been planned for the past three years.”</p>\n<p>Because of Deltopia weekend this year, Spring Insight organizers also plan to keep prospective freshmen and families away from Isla Vista during the weekend by inviting families to eat at campus restaurants without mentioning places to eat in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Usually we tell people, ‘You can eat on campus … but you can also go to I.V. and try all these eateries,’” Reimel said. “This year we’re not doing that. We’re really trying to keep them focused on campus, amping up our programming up a little bit, trying to provide more to keep them engaged while they’re here.”</p>\n<p>Another concern of Spring Insight organizers is that Deltopia partygoers might take up parking spots on campus. Christopher Zbinden, the enforcement and guest services manager from UCSB’s Transportation &amp; Parking Services department, said although the university’s policy of “no weekend overnight visitor parking” has not changed, the department will create a way to distinguish vehicles staying for Spring Insight from those who are not.</p>\n<p>“If you’re coming into Spring Insight to register, you can actually print out a permit … there’s no cost, but it’s a way to identity those vehicles just in the event that one does stay overnight. That’ll help us best identify those people,” Zbinden said.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he encourages the UCSB community to provide a welcoming environment for prospective freshmen regardless of Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“Through the partnership with our students, I understand that they, like all members of our campus, take pride in our community and value the reputation of where they live, learn, and work,” Yang said in an email. “These are the values that I encourage all of us to convey as we welcome our prospective students and their families to our campus during Spring Insight.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-76068\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors met to discuss the extension of a festival ordinance to include this year’s Deltopia. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill would extend the ordinance from its current dates, which do not cover this year’s Deltopia. On the listed dates, the Santa Barbara County Code prohibits outdoor festivals or any similar musical activity, defined as music played at any location not built exclusively for that purpose such as a concert hall or music venue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current law sets an ordinance on April 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 and Oct. 26 through Nov. 4, but it does not cover this year’s Deltopia weekend, which will take place April 7, 8 and 9.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amendment to the ordinance was initially proposed by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office on Feb. 14 and would extend the days to include this year’s Deltopia as well as the following six years’ celebrations, including Halloween.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Supervisors meeting next week will determine the adoption of the bill. Board members must vote to pass the amendment, though it is likely to pass as all five members of the board voted in favor of setting the date for the hearing at Tuesday’s meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commander Kelly Moore of the Sheriff’s office spoke at the board meeting to discuss the amendment and said the previous two years’ Deltopia events saw much smaller crowds as a result of the festival ordinance. Commander Moore said the 2015 crowd was approximated to be 10,000 and the 2016 crowd was near 3,500, compared to 2014’s estimated 20,000 to 25,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several I.V. community members also spoke at the meeting, including I.V. Community Services District Director-elect Spencer Brandt, who said the festival ordinance is flawed but continues to be useful to law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The festival ordinance is an integral tool for the Sheriff’s Office and other partnering law enforcement agencies to make use of,” Brandt said. “While it is an imperfect solution, I see no reason why this policy shouldn’t be continued this year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Senate passed a resolution last week articulating the Senate’s position in favor of the amendment to the ordinance dates. Senator Batsheva Stoll, who authored the resolution, spoke at the board meeting to reiterate the Senate’s view on the ordinance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re in support of the ordinance as long as it’s being enforced on the day of Deltopia,” she said. “We want to make sure that, when it’s being enforced, it’s being enforced fairly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stoll said law enforcement’s presence at Deltopia could be a point of misunderstanding for students and stressed that police should work with campus organizations like UCIV to minimize potential conflict. UCIV is a volunteer organization at UC Santa Barbara that warns residents when they might be violating ordinances, connects students with medical services when needed and hands out free condoms and water during Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the time, there can be miscommunications with students and law enforcement, so we urge [law enforcement] to work with organizations like UCIV that volunteer to help students understand the law and kind of work as sort of a middleman to ensure that everything runs smoothly on Deltopia,” Stoll said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76078\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/county-to-reinstate-festival-ordinance-for-deltopia-2017/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76078\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/county-to-reinstate-festival-ordinance-for-deltopia-2017/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/county-to-reinstate-festival-ordinance-for-deltopia-2017/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/county-to-reinstate-festival-ordinance-for-deltopia-2017/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/county-to-reinstate-festival-ordinance-for-deltopia-2017/","id":4442,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4441,4440,4439],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Report Shows Stability in I.V.

Despite the increase from the last year, Chuck Flacks, executive director of C3H, said the homeless population has remained “remarkably stable” in recent years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said because Isla Vista has “a very small sample” of people who are homeless, the 37 percent increase only reflects “one or two” more people coming in to I.V. since 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did see a small increase, but it wasn’t a huge increase, and the reality is that things have remained fairly stable,” Flacks said. “Population stays consistent as a result of homeless outreach and housing for the homeless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks said the “consistent” numbers are likely a result of homeless outreach organizations in Isla Vista such as the Pescadero Lofts, a complex that opened in 2014 to help keep homeless community members off the streets. The complex currently houses 35 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Flacks, the Pescadero Lofts are “proof” that through community outreach, counties can reduce the amount of people who are homeless living in an area. The Pescadero Lofts offer counseling for people as well as an alcohol and drug program.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The C3H report also showed that 33 percent of unsheltered people have health insurance, which Flack attributed to the Affordable Care Act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Under the Affordable Care Act, we saw a huge expansion of people who are homeless getting access to Medi-Cal,” Flacks said. “Typically, we encourage them to go to primary health providers who accept Medi-Cal, and we’ve had a lot of success, seeing fewer people dying on the streets as a result of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks said, however, that many people who are homeless are worried about how lawmakers at the  federal government are  proposing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Flacks, Isla Vista is one of the “poorest communities in the county” and said the results of the homeless census do not account for the countless people who are “unstably housed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the need for affordable housing is “critical” when there are residents couchsurfing or living in doubled and tripled rooms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The census] is a baseline of the total homeless and potentially homeless population in I.V.,” he said. “The biggest problem — and that’s a countywide concern — is access to affordable housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks emphasized that aiding homeless community members can only reduce the homeless population. He said people who are homeless are reminders that “our system is not working” in regard to mental health and alcohol and drug treatment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Homeless people are like the canary in the coal mine for our society, and they’re a visible reminder of neglect,” Flacks said. “So when we have more people on the street, it means we’re doing something wrong.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/","id":4443,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[4442,4441,4440],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
