As a freshman in high school, I was just being introduced to the actualities of “womanhood” and sex. Being that I was essentially clueless as to what sex actually entailed, I was extremely curious about it. I mean, who isn’t slightly disturbed yet intrigued after first hearing about “the birds and the bees?”</p>\n<p>As I flipped through the beauty ads and fashion tips, I came across a section titled, “5 Lies He’ll Say To Get in Your Pants.” At the time this seemed like immensely valuable information, so I decided to read it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The first “lie” was extremely obvious; giving the old “he’ll only say I love you to sleep with you!” rant. I had heard that one from my grandmother since I was about five, so I felt pretty equipped to handle that. However, the second one caught me by major surprise. It talked about how a guy might tell me, “I don’t want to use a condom because then I can’t feel anything.” Being that the majority of my sexual knowledge came from sex-ed, I was totally shell-shocked.</p>\n<p>I mean, after learning of all of the horrors that can come with an unwanted pregnancy or STD, what kind of idiot would say they don’t want to use a condom just because it doesn’t feel as good? Isn’t that why Trojan makes “Ultra Thin?” In my baffled state I reasoned that I would never be interested in a guy that would be that selfish or idiotic. About three years later, when I became sexually active, I was forced to face the hard truth about boys and condoms.</p>\n<p>Nearly every guy that I’ve encountered in the bedroom has attempted to sleep with me without using a condom. Some of them were long-term relationships, others … not so much. My first experience was obviously blinding and scary like it is for most young men and women. The guy was a little older than me, and much more experienced. Therefore, I put all of my trust into him, thinking he knew what was best.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nearly every guy that I’ve encountered in the bedroom has attempted to sleep with me without using a condom.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was never one of those girls that thought that I would want to wait until marriage for sex; I’ve always been somewhat of a realist. But I definitely thought I would always be extremely responsible and NEVER risk getting an STD or pregnant.</p>\n<p>Then, the first time I had sex, I allowed the guy to convince me that a condom wasn’t necessary. He told me, “You can’t get pregnant the first time you have sex,” a lie I stupidly believed. Luckily, I didn’t get pregnant and I didn’t catch an STD. However, I did lose a sense of confidence and independence that was very important when making any big decisions. The fact that I had given in so easily, without really thinking twice, made me question how secure I was in myself. They say that before you can truly care about anyone else, you have to be able to care for you. If I had truly been secure in myself, I would have stuck to my standards and made him wear a condom, regardless of his excuses.</p>\n<p>Since then I have gained enough experience to come to the realization that many guys will try to get by without using condoms. At first, I thought that my taste in men had just taken a completely wrong turn; but after talking to a handful of girlfriends, I realized that it’s much more common than not. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the guy who tries to sleep with you minus a condom is a disgusting, selfish asshole; it just means that he might not think he has as much to lose.</p>\n<p>When an unwanted pregnancy occurs, the woman is the one who truly faces the most adversaries. Her body is the one being forced to undergo some sort of drastic measure, whether it is to have an abortion or carry a baby to term. She is the one who has to make the difficult and life-altering decision.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When an unwanted pregnancy occurs, the woman is the one who truly faces the most adversaries.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While a man endures various struggles that may come with getting a girl pregnant, they’re not nearly as severe. In regards to STDs, it still surprises me that guys often seem to feel invincible to them. I mean HIV, herpes and chlamydia don’t discriminate based on gender. However, women do actually have a few more things to worry about when it comes to STDs. HPV (human papillomavirus) has several strains that can cause cervical cancer in women. The results can be deadly, especially since symptoms rarely show.</p>\n<p>The terrifying part is that the majority of sexually active men carry HPV, yet don’t realize it considering it doesn’t affect them. If a carrier of HPV has unprotected sex with someone, the consequences can be severe. In addition, curable STDs such as chlamydia can cause infertility in women when left untreated. These are a couple of reasons why men may be more relaxed when it comes to the necessity of a condom</p>\n<p>While they can sometimes be inconvenient, annoying and tedious, there really is no good enough reason for a man to state that he doesn’t want to use a condom. Unless both you and your partner have been tested and have access to other forms of birth control, no one has any business claiming that a condom is not necessary. If you’re a woman who is not comfortable having sex without a condom, stick to your standards and do not budge. It’s you’re body, and you’re the one who may have the most to lose. While guys may think it’s just not that big of deal in the moment, it definitely will be in the long run.</p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos asks you to condone the condom.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/having-condom-sense/","id":6305,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6304,6303,6302],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos","biography":"Not available","articles":[6284,6286,6292,6299,6301,6303,6304,6305,6308,6342,6362],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Girl (and boy) Interrupted","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/knockyoufuckingdumbass.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/knockyoufuckingdumbass.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sebastianne Kent talks through the major inconvenience of getting interrupted when getting intimate. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista is a town full of young college-aged students who spend a lot of time in the sun and look pretty damn good. It makes sense that there’s a lot of sex happening. What also happens quite a bit is getting interrupted during the act. It’s happened to almost everybody I know, and in many different compromising … positions. Most recently I was interrupted during the fulfillment of a certain job, which is taxing enough given the need to control one’s gag reflex and also give pleasure at the same time. I heard a door open and paused — dick in mouth. I looked up to make direct eye contact with a housemate who had gone into the adjoining room for who knows what.</p>\n<p>In another circumstance we could’ve laughed it off, but in this case, it felt as though she was more offended than I or the guy I was with was. This brings me to the question: in a place where most people are having sex, and we’re stacked on top of each other sometimes three to a room, why do some people get upset when they hear or see people having sex? Why is it surprising and why can’t people just knock?</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

But outside of our nuclear friend groups there are social stigmas that attach themselves to our sexual actions which reach back to how we are taught about sex, and the social climate of the United States as a whole. The walk of shame, for example, is seemingly only something that exists for women. Walking through the hallways of a frat in which you may have hooked up with someone, you’re more likely to be greeted with catcalls than high fives, and the promenade home opens you up to a bevy of evil eye glances and calls of the word “slut.”</p>\n<p>Men have a completely different experience. Maybe it’s because their going-out clothes transition better from night to day, but either way, the difference is stark. We all do it, want to do it and if we haven’t we most likely will eventually, so the idea that people are shamed in a place where people wear ass-bearing shorts more often than coats or sweaters is inane and harmful.</p>\n<blockquote><p>…a friend of mine was overheard getting nasty at midnight on a Sunday in her <i>single</i> and told by her roommate that it “hurt her soul” to hear her</p></blockquote>\n<p>In one of the best and perhaps most upsetting examples of being shamed for something entirely natural, a friend of mine was overheard getting nasty at midnight on a Sunday in her <i>single</i> and told by her roommate that it “hurt her soul” to hear her (she had also assumed the people in question were being loud purposely, knowing she was outside). My friend was rightly confused as to why it was assumed she was being blatantly exhibitionist without at least a clarification first; but more troublingly, why did the knowledge that sex was happening near her hurt her soul? I’d be happy for whoever was getting it, but that’s just me. At the very least, I’d suggest putting in a pair of headphones and continuing on with your life. The idea that someone could be judged in the middle of an intimate act is something, that if I had the time and money to complete a second degree at UCSB, I most definitely would devote a thesis to studying.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s one thing to be on a dance floor somewhere or outside in plain sight. But what I mean specifically is when you’re in your room…</p></blockquote>\n<p>All of this can culminate in a denial that seems to shock most of us when we see somebody getting it, giving it or what have you. It’s one thing to be on a dance floor somewhere or outside in plain sight. But what I mean specifically is when you’re in your room (mine is a single so it happens more rarely) or in a private place you wouldn’t expect someone to walk in unannounced. This can be jarring for all parties involved. For example, imagine my surprise when during one of the activities in question, I heard a loud knock on my bedroom door. I was home alone at the time except for the guy with me of course, so I was thoroughly confused.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was one of the situations where the most confident version of myself would’ve walked up to the door bare-ass naked and told the intruder to leave, but instead I said nobody was home (which clearly wasn’t true), giggled and went back to what I was doing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This situation really arose from a lack of boundaries because it turned out that a friend of my housemate’s wanted to know if she was home and apparently wasn’t deterred by the sounds coming from my room. It was one of the situations where the most confident version of myself would’ve walked up to the door bare-ass naked and told the intruder to leave, but instead I said nobody was home (which clearly wasn’t true), giggled and went back to what I was doing. In a situation where your privacy has been violated, as is the case much of the time, I think it’s fair to have a little fun and make sure the party that’s really guilty gets at least as embarrassed as you did.</p>\n<p>I guess the last thing that must be discussed is what to do when you catch someone in the act. If I didn’t really know the person, I’d apologize and make a hasty exit. If it were a friend, I’d do the same, and then high five them and ask for details later. But I suppose the best advice I have is never judge because it will almost inevitably happen to you, just based on the number of times you’re likely to have sex during your lifetime. Not only this, but remember to always, <i>always</i> knock.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Sebastianne Kent can’t imagine a scenario where you shouldn’t knock, just to make sure.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70423\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70423\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/","id":6302,"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent"},"related":[6301,6300,6299],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Drunken Emotions, a Sobering Reality and Getting Screwed","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dailyhump.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dailyhump.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos warns against holding past experiences against new people. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This weekend, I learned a few unexpected and completely mortifying life lessons. It all stemmed from the fact that I decided to drown my unwanted emotions in tequila. I know that drinking to cope with emotion is unhealthy, but I also know we all make mistakes. Well, unfortunately for me, the mistakes I made this weekend will probably haunt me for a while. Not just because of the humiliation that I feel, but also because of the disappointing things I learned about myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, I’ve always thought of myself as being pretty well-rounded. Since I was about five years old, I can remember being told that I’m an old soul, that I’m incredibly mature and that I have a bright future ahead of me. I moved out of my dad’s house when I was 18, and then moved across the country when I was 20. I make good grades, I have an internship that I love and I’m surrounded by an amazing group of family and friends who support me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I’ve never been hesitant to follow my dreams, and success has always seemed attainable to me. However, my biggest struggle that has plagued me since I turned 16 is my ability to maintain any sort of intimate relationship. I had always thought it was just because I’d been dealt a really shitty hand and that my taste in men was awful. After this weekend, I have come to the disappointing conclusion that a lot of the problem actually lies within myself.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I was surrounded by romance and cuteness, listening to stories of first kisses and first times. I watched adorable “promposals” and saw countless candid photos of teens in love on my Instagram. At the time, I wasn’t really envious. I actually thought they were all idiots. Maybe my parents’ dysfunctional marriage made me bitter, or maybe I was repressing my jealousy at the lack of affection in my life. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of why, I didn’t feel like I was missing out on much. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the back of my mind, I knew these dramatic and naïve relationships wouldn’t last long after graduation. Then, right before the start of my senior year, I experienced my first real, intimate relationship. It was not cute, it was not romantic, and it was nothing like my friends’. It was damaging, abusive and emotionally traumatic. It was my first and only real encounter with any sort of romantic or sexual feeling. And, after it abruptly ended, it was the only thing I knew. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two years that followed this relationship were a complete and utter mess. With this newfound heartbreak and my parents’ ongoing divorce, I felt completely out of control. I turned to partying and casual sex, thinking it would make me look less pathetic or weak. If anything, it did the exact opposite. Every relationship that followed was a rollercoaster, going from being extremely great to utterly sorrowful and back around again. I don’t even think I liked the guys that I was spending my time with, but I needed to feel some sort of validation from them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even after starting college, the relationships were all distorted and tumultuous. Eventually, being sad felt more comfortable than being happy. In my head, each guy was the same, and I knew that soon enough I would be screwed over and left to feel unworthy. I was dealing with conflicting emotions of frustration, shame and embarrassment. I couldn’t believe that I had let these guys affect me in such a negative way, even to the extent of doubting my own self-worth. Then I got my acceptance letter to UCSB, and I knew I would get a clean slate.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been about nine months since I transferred here. I love it even more than I ever thought I would. However, I naively and blindly assumed that moving far away from the people in my past would mean that the baggage I carry would stay behind as well. A few weeks ago, I met a guy that was unbelievably sweet and goofy. Not really the type of person you’d expect to meet at a frat party. At first, I thought he was totally safe and not someone I would really be that interested in. Then, after getting to know him better, the unsettling realization that I might actually like him set in.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Treat every new person in your life with a clean slate, regardless of who hurt you in the past, try not to let your reaction be an overreaction and stay the hell away from Jose Cuervo.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Long story short, I panicked. I was already so on edge about my own feelings that I sabotaged the entire thing over a minuscule action. I got drunk, made a complete ass of myself, and the only person I can blame is me. I was completely disrespectful and crazy to someone who had given me no reason to act in such a way. Someone who had been nothing but sweet to me. Someone whose company I was really beginning to enjoy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here I am again, feeling sorry for myself. Only this time, it’s way worse. Because this time, I have to face the fact that I screwed myself. I screwed myself out of something that had potential to actually be good. I screwed myself out of making a real connection with someone. I screwed myself before even giving him the chance to screw up. If anything good is going to come out of this humiliation and regret, then I guess it’s the fact that I’ll never turn to alcohol for advice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll never project old relationships onto new ones. I’ll never blame someone for my unhappiness before look at my own actions. And I’ll never again let insecurities from my past drive the decisions that I make in the present.

Unless you’re in a serious or long-term relationship, you most likely haven’t reached that level of comfortability where waking up with makeup smeared and teeth unbrushed are normal and pleasant. Those awkward moments experienced during the morning after, where you can feel insecure, unprepared and just downright annoyed, can all be diminished by carrying these four small items in your purse.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Condom(s):</em> This is probably the most important item to have in your bag if you think that you might be going home with someone. Common misconception and stereotype says that the guy should always have the condom. This ideology is unbelievably outdated and can have dangerous consequences. Once you’ve started hooking up and reach a certain point, it becomes pretty hard to stop. Therefore, if you’re making out with someone and you’ve both decided that you want to have sex, yet neither of you have a condom, you might make the impulsive decision to have intercourse without protection.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Common misconception and stereotype says that the guy should always have the condom. This ideology is unbelievably outdated and can have dangerous consequences.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">While it may seem like a fine idea at time, once the arousal and adrenaline has worn off, you’re going to be filled with grief and stress over the idea of possibly contracting an STI or having an unwanted pregnancy due to a stupid decision made the night before. To ensure that you take all steps necessary to prevent that uncomfortable dissonance experienced in the morning, it’s best to just always buy and carry your own condoms.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Mints:</em> One of my least favorite things about waking up next to someone in the morning is the fact that I have to be near someone before I’ve had the chance to brush my teeth. If you wake up in a new partner’s home, it can be super annoying to have to quietly get up, find the bathroom and locate their toothpaste, only to have to use your finger to brush your teeth (because carrying a toothbrush would be somewhat excessive). If you’re lucky, they might be a mouthwash kind of person, and you can just steal a swig of Listerine.</p>\n<p>However, just to be safe, I find it easiest to always carry either gum or mints. Anything really will do, whether it’s Altoids or Extra, just make sure you have something. You can quietly reach into your purse, pop one in and relinquish the taste of morning. Word of caution: sometimes mints are a better choice over gum, simply because mints dissolve while gum doesn’t. Therefore, if your partner wakes up and tries to spontaneously kiss you, it can be slightly awkward if you’re chomping on some Orbit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70645\" style=\"width: 467px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70645\" data-attachment-id=\"70645\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/morning-after-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?fit=1360%2C1927&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1360,1927\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"morning after art\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?fit=176%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?fit=723%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70645 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=457%2C647\" alt=\"Art by Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus \" width=\"457\" height=\"647\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?w=1360&amp;ssl=1 1360w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=176%2C250&amp;ssl=1 176w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=768%2C1088&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/morning-after-art-.png?resize=723%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70645\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Art by Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>A comb:</em> If you have long, thick hair like me, you know that more often than not, it is possible to wake up with a rat’s nest on top of your head. Sex definitely doesn’t help. After a night of … fornication, a girl’s hair is not bound to look the same as it did the night before. The curls have unraveled and the hairspray has gone awry. It can get tangled, knotted and just be downright frustrating to deal with in the morning, especially when you’re not in your own home with your own things.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">After a night of … fornication, a girl’s hair is not bound to look the same as it did the night before.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">OK, I know a comb is not nearly as effective as a brush; however, carrying an actual brush around in a small bag is neither always ideal nor possible. If you don’t own a comb, go get one. They are tiny, effective and easy to whip out when necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Foundation:</em> the only makeup item that you really need to carry incase you decide to have an unexpected slumber party. Mascara, eyeliner, blush, etc., are all great but way too excessive and annoying to carry around. The truth is, very few people look picture perfect in the mornings. Yet, simply having some cover-up or foundation to put under your eyes, or cover last night’s smeared makeup, can take away some of those insecurities you might experience when seeing a new partner not-so-fresh faced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is, all of the above listed items, besides a condom (ALWAYS CARRY ONE), are superficial amenities that aren’t by any means necessary, but can alleviate some of the uncomfortable annoyances that come with spending the night out. While the person you wake up to should never expect you to look like Sleeping Beauty awaking from her slumber, these easy tips can make your morning after experience much more enjoyable and relaxed.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos hopes these tips make it so you never have to stress the next morning again.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70643\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70643\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-04/how-to-ease-a-girls-morning-after/","id":6304,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6303,6302,6301],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
