Brecht would walk the opening batter of the game then hit the next one giving Irvine runners on first and second.</p>\n<p>Junior infielder Brandon Lewis, a member of the USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award Midseason Watch List, brought home a run for the ‘Eaters lacing a ball through left field.</p>\n<p>With runners on the corners and no outs, Brecht responded by getting the next Irvine batter, Adrian Damla, to hit into a double play, then struck out Mike Peadbody to end the first allowing just one run despite the shaky start.</p>\n<p>With two outs in the first, junior center fielder Tommy Jew kept the bottom half of the first frame alive by rocketing a ball to right field to leg out his fifth triple of the year. He would come around to score following an RBI single from Rowan tying the match at 1-1.</p>\n<p>After that Lewis RBI single, Brecht really settled in retiring the next 11 batters not allowing another hit until the fifth inning. By then, UCSB held a 2-1 advantage thanks to a home run to left center from Rowan in the third inning, the only hit of that inning.</p>\n<p>Even with allowing a hit in the fifth plus a walk, Brecht kept working his way out of every jam. In the top of the eighth, up 2-1, with two outs, UCSB’s defense faltered. It faltered in a way very reminiscent to the Gauchos losses at St. Mary’s and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>First, sophomore third baseman Jason Willow could not field a ball hit down the line to him, then junior short stop McClain O’Connor misplayed a ball. This set up Irvine with the tying run on second and the go-ahead on first.</p>\n<p>Following the two errors, Brecht would be relieved by freshman Michael McGreevy. Brecht finished the day allowing just three hits and walked two batters. His eight strikeouts give him 69 on the year, pushing him back in front of having the league’s most K’s.</p>\n<p>McGreevy inherited the two runners, and did not let them go anywhere forcing a ground out, ending the top half of the frame.</p>\n<p>Up 2-1, UCSB needed a few more insurance runs just to keep themselves in a favorable position heading into the ninth. The Gauchos got those runs thanks to a solo home run from Rowan to kick off the inning.</p>\n<p>After the round tripper, junior outfielder Armani Smith ripped a ball to left center to leg out his team-high sixth triple of the year. A double from Andrew Martinez would bring home Smith and give UCSB a 4-1 lead.</p>\n<p>In the ninth, McGreevy gave up one hit, but nothing else en route to his fifth save of the year and securing Santa Barbara’s game one, 4-1 win.</p>\n<p>All-in-all, UCSB played a good game, delivering nine hits on the day and handing junior Andre Pallante his third loss of the year.</p>\n<p>Today’s win also marks another positive for UCSB: it continues to highlight that this team is for real. Though a better way to do that would be to seal up a series victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will face UC Irvine in game two of the series beginning at 2 p.m. on Saturday, April 13 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

transformed into a warm yet still stylish space. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The few seats available had been claimed, leaving others to bunch up near the door, craning to catch a glimpse at the men responsible for filling the Friday night air with music. A group of professors sat together toward the front of the room, while other adults from the local Santa Barbara community sat at tables enjoying food. Students crowded the back, mostly standing and swaying to the beat, and Chancellor Henry T. Yang and his wife were seated at a far table with their eyes fixed on the band at the front, the music uniting different and usually separate groups of people that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the scene of the first performance of the new year for Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse, a pop-up club featuring a series of local musicians who aim to bring the Isla Vista community together and provide a space for music and conversation on important topics. The event series was founded in 2015 by Jeffrey Stewart, a professor in UC Santa Barbara’s Department of Black Studies​ and a recent Pulitzer Prize winner for the biography “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the project was formed as a response to the distress felt after the Isla Vista tragedy, Stewart said. Wanting to bring the people of I.V. back together again, Stewart could think of no better way than through music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea was initially sparked by a student’s comment that made note of the similarities between the small, congested and tense venues in Paris and those in I.V. Inspired by the intimacy of the jazz clubs, Stewart said he saw the value in replicating them for the community surrounding UCSB and I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was in Pasadena, we used to have coffeehouses and people would play jazz, so I just tried to reproduce it,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each venue for Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse is carefully selected and transformed into a warm yet still stylish space, Stewart said. The series also works in conjunction with Stewart’s class, History of Jazz, and runs alongside it during winter quarter. After trying to bring musicians into class to perform for students, Stewart said he quickly realized that it wasn’t the right environment for students, or anyone for that matter, to be able to enjoy or appreciate jazz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need learning environments in the community that aren’t as heavy handed as a real classroom,” Stewart noted. Now, with the creation of Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse, his students are always in attendance and able to experience jazz in its natural setting, rather than in a classroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The theory of the class is that jazz evolves through dialogue between the performers and the audience,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart said he hopes that students will discover new tastes and different preferences through  the music they experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s his goal “that the students have a feeling that they’re part of this, [that] they’re not just spectators or listeners.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its creation, Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse has been unique in its ability to attract a wide variety of different people to its events, Stewart said. He noted that “a lot of students live here, but they have really no interaction with the people in the community,” which he aims to change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events such as Stewart’s are one of a few that make an attempt to bridge the gap between different generations in the community, he said. While it’s often rare to see professors, students and locals of I.V. together in the same space, these events encourage exactly that, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only here can a professor show their students how to properly bust a move on the dance floor, while Chancellor Yang catches it all on video. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s not really a space on campus even for professors to hang out,” Stewart added. While the University Center is often the go-to meeting spot, he said “it doesn’t seem warm; it often feels cold and commercial.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These events also provide a much-needed outlet and space for dialogue among I.V. residents, Stewart said. Often featuring spoken word and panels on relevant issues like intersectional justice, gender, violence and food insecurity, these pop-up clubs make an effort to accompany music with meaningful conversation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart emphasized the need for these types of spaces, remarking that “there are very few places where students can come and have discussions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey’s Jazz Coffeehouse is proof, Stewart said, that “you can have learning going on in spaces that are also pleasurable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to have this cited in Isla Vista, in the hopes that more people will come from downtown and be able to view this community not just as some crazy college town,” Stewart said — a testament to the power music has to bring a community together.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/me.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/emily-kocis/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Emily Kocis</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Emily Kocis is the 2020-2021 Assistant Opinion Editor.

We want to have some upward momentum going into the end of the season and give our guys that aren’t returning a good taste in our mouths.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Mustangs have swept the Gauchos the past two seasons and will look to do so again this season as they currently own a 24-27 overall record, 9-9 conference mark.</p>\n<p>In the standings, they are five games behind first-place CSUF with six games to go.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to SLO boasting a 24-24-1 overall record and a 8-10 Big West mark. Santa Barbara is coming off a 6-5 walk-off victory against Cal State Bakersfield this past Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“The effort has been better the last few games even in some of those losses to Long Beach last weekend. The guys grinded out a good win on Tuesday and we will go as far as our pitching takes us,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Along with playing its conference rival, the Gauchos are still in a very good position to finish the season strong, as with seven games to go, they can make it appoint to finish above .500, something they did not do last season, and improve upon its current seventh-place standing in the conference.</p>\n<p>Historically, UCSB has played well against Cal Poly as it currently owns a 93-73-1 record against its rivals, however, in the Andrew Checketts era, Santa Barbara has gone just 7-15 and has lost six straight to date.</p>\n<p>“We have not played well against them the last few times and traditionally their place is a tough place to play at but we have to show up and execute it does not matter who is on the other side of the dugout, we want to play our best baseball,” Checketts said. “We compete against each other in all facets of the game including recruiting so we do have that healthy rivalry and we want to win.”</p>\n<p>In order to not only just take one game from the Mustangs this weekend, but hopefully the whole series, the Gauchos will need excellent pitching performances from each of their starters and even their bullpen guys.</p>\n<p>In a 12-0 loss against LBSU on Saturday, starter right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln was rocked as he allowed six hits and seven runs in just 2.2 innings pitched. To be fair to the sophomore, he was coming off a nagging back injury he sustained the week before.</p>\n<p>This week, Lincoln will look to get back to form as his match against LBSU was definitely not the norm coaches and fans have come to expect from him.</p>\n<p>“He couldn’t land his off-speed pitches for strikes and he was fat in the middle of the plate when he was behind the count so that’s a recipe for a bad start,” Checketts said. “He hasn’t had a stinker before that so I am looking forward to seeing him bounce back and respond.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will also need more meaningful contributions from the bullpen guys as junior Kevin Chandler has a 5.54 ERA in 15 appearances, freshman Chris Troye has a 4.82 ERA in 16 appearances and junior Alex Patterson has a 3.82 ERA in 21 appearances.</p>\n<p>In a Friday start, senior Stevie Ledesma had a solid outing and handed the bullpen an 8-4 lead but the Gauchos were unable to hold on losing the game 9-8. Games like this are what drives fans and the team crazy.</p>\n<p>This weekend in particular, the Gaucho pitching staff will have their work cut out for them as they are going up against a Cal Poly team that currently owns the best batting average (.273), slugging percentage (.375) and second-best on-base percentage (.408) in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Along with owning the conference’s best batting average, the Mustangs also have two of the top-five best hitters in the conference.</p>\n<p>Outfielder Alex McKenna owns a .347 batting average which is the second-best in the Big West to go along with 30 RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Catcher Nick Meyer has the fourth best batting average in the conference with a .333 percentage. Infielder Tate Samuelson has the most runs batted in with 37.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, this weekend is all about continuing the uphill trend.</p>\n<p>With an even overall record and much room for improvement, this team still has a lot to play for and while this season will not result in the National Championship, it could be what the team looks back on a year from now as to what made a dream run in the NCAA Tournament possible.</p>\n<p>“Going to Omaha is not always a one-year process, sometimes it is a three, four, five-year process if we want to get back there and we can’t wait until next fall because we want to go about everything the right way. We need to play with the mentality that we want to have next spring now,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will take on Cal Poly for game one of a three-game set at 6 p.m. on Friday, May 18 at Robin Baggett Stadium.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
