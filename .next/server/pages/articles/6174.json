A recent column (“The Pointlessness of Pot Persecution,” Daily Nexus, May 16, 2011) essentially stated “the man is keeping us down by illegalizing weed,” and then — and this one is a direct quote, mind you — insisted that “we only need a nanny state to take care of us because we have become disconnected from our natural niche within nature.” The column goes on to assert that social programs, modern medicine and war are merely byproducts of our disconnect from the natural state of affairs.</p>\n<p>I’ve heard this argument before, and I think it tends to be made by people who do not have a good idea of what might actually constitute “our natural niche within nature.” Anyone who has a legitimate interest in nature probably knows the unaltered natural environment is a dangerous place where animals barely scrape out an existence. They reproduce, live long enough to ensure their progeny can survive and then they die — for humans this probably equates to a lifespan of about 30 to 40 years. It should also be noted that agriculture — growing weed included — probably would not be considered within our natural niche. In fact, without modern technology or “the man” defending us, we would probably be forced to spend the majority of our time fighting off wild animals with sticks and not getting baked. Being stoned is not generally conducive to survival.</p>\n<p>Now, I don’t think the column was legitimately claiming we’d be better off as hunter-gatherers, but that’s actually my point. I don’t think even the columnist really knows what he was advocating, and long angry rants about society and drug laws remind me of an upset toddler, screaming and waving his arms after not getting his way. I’ve seen several articles that seem to assert legalized weed is great because primitive cultures used it. Primitive cultures also used opium and sacrificed human beings to their gods. While I personally wouldn’t equate marijuana with narcotics or human sacrifice, I also think there are many things primitive cultures did that we now recognize are not particularly beneficial.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Essentially, these pro-weed arguments seem about as coherent as someone who is currently stoned.

And, most notably, my father’s colloquial phrase of choice, “Work hard, play hard.” These phrases have all served to condition me into believing that only through monastic resolve can anything meaningful be accomplished. I guess it is because of this lifelong process of indoctrination that the circumstances of Osama bin Laden’s death reawaken my inner rebellion.</p>\n<p>Now, before you get all up in arms, I realize that using his situation takes us a bit into the realm of hyperbole. In no way am I condoning his actions as anything other than reprehensible, but I can’t deny that in watching his home videos that were subsequently released, I came to the realization that life requires a careful balance, and that having one singular purpose to validate one’s own existence can’t possibly be healthy. Granted, I’m not being pursued by the world’s most formidable military, but that’s beside the point.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that college, for all of its fun moments, can be a stressful undertaking. Coupled with the added pressures of friends and family belittling college with the typical “Wait until you’re in the real world,” along with grades, this life can get pretty tough. What’s important is to resist attempting to objectively measure our lives, whether through tests or money, therefore rendering the subjective experience as an afterthought. The results of that physics test, which has consumed your every waking moment for the last week, won’t change the fact that gravity exists, or cause any other unforeseen life-altering circumstance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I’ve come to believe, as many of you probably have, that college serves to prepare you for your career. So, unless you plan on going into the NBA, it’s probably a good idea that you’re here. For most of us, a career will mean 40 to 50 hours a week spent doing something that will become a means to an end. That, based on my calculations, still leaves those 120 odd hours that will need to be filled by some combination of sleep and activity. Undoubtedly, classes, tests and all that comes with school can prepare you for those 40 hours, but the college experience is what does the rest.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m not proposing complete abdication of all responsibility in favor of daily afternoon shifts ordering mind erasers at Study Hall, but rather, my point can be illustrated with an analogy. Pretend life is a road and traffic is all the unfortunate shit that happens along the way. If you constrain yourself to one lane, inevitably the road will have its fair share of accidents, maybe a few speed bumps, but either way you’ll become dependent upon its course. So make life a freeway, change lanes, and, unless it’s the 405, eventually you’ll end up content and where you want to be. Whether you’re hiding in a compound in Abbottabad or sequestered in godforsaken Davidson, keep in mind that outside there’s a world of opportunity.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/life-depth-dynamics-results-deadend-future/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/life-depth-dynamics-results-deadend-future/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/life-depth-dynamics-results-deadend-future/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/life-depth-dynamics-results-deadend-future/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/life-depth-dynamics-results-deadend-future/","id":6171,"author":{"id":504,"name":"Jake Schurmeier"},"related":[6170,6169,6168],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Prefontaine Plan Key to Slimming America’s Waistline","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The six-fingered man from “The Princess Bride” once said, “If you haven’t got your health, then you haven’t got anything.” This principle still holds true today but has now been amended to...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The six-fingered man from “The Princess Bride” once said, “If you haven’t got your health, then you haven’t got anything.” This principle still holds true today but has now been amended to: “If you have your health, great — you just might have to spend everything you have to get it.” Unlike illegal immigration or tax increases, health care costs can actually inflict severe damage on your economic viability, and that’s not including the added agony involved in dealing with the faceless tyranny of medical insurers.</p>\n<p>Despite how aggravating it can be to be a customer of the health care industry, there are still a lot of people shuffling through the supermarket whose body dimensions don’t seem to reflect any concern about the potential hazards of a hospital visit.

Hence, the Prefontaine plan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If your high school physical education teacher had any historical acumen, you may have had the good fortune to watch a movie about Steve Prefontaine during class one day. Prefontaine ran track for the University of Oregon, and, through a unique combination of charisma and determination, became something of a cult hero both in the state and in the track and field community at large before his life was cut short by a car accident.</p>\n<p>What the Prefontaine plan would do is provide motivation for the average cubicle worker to maintain some minimum level of physical fitness. What is that minimum level? It’s being able to run a mile in seven minutes or less. Make it around the track in that amount of time, and there’s going to be a $1,000 check waiting for you at the finish line, courtesy of the U.S. Department of Treasury. Because, what could be a more brilliant way to save our country from financial ruin than having the government give away more money. And under the Prefontaine plan, you earn $1,000 every year that you’re able to meet the seven-minute standard. And that’s that.</p>\n<p>So how is the Prefontaine plan going to make society significantly healthier and thus reduce medical costs, allowing insurance rates to go down and the government to be financially solvent? Well, being able to run a mile in seven minutes or less means you have at least a moderate level of aerobic ability and willpower, even if you’re only capable of doing it once a year. Also, it involves running, which is one of the easier and more effective ways to stay healthy (and by healthy I mean lower blood pressure, lower pulse, lower risk of cancer, lower stress levels, lower decline in mental functioning, lower levels of insomnia, lower lifestyle gap between yourself and Daniel Day-Lewis’s character in “The Last of the Mohicans,” etc.).</p>\n<p>I’m aware that most people perceive the action of running to be a dreary chore, and it absolutely can be if you do most of your running on treadmills or sidewalks, so don’t do that. If the town where you live doesn’t have a beach, a forest, a park, a hill or any other natural landforms, then I’d suggest you move or conduct your running during twilight hours.</p>\n<p>Without the Prefontaine plan, there’s not much evidence to suggest that people are going to stop ignoring advice about diet and exercise. With it, that bus driver in South Dakota who just finished her shift suddenly has a pretty good reason to take an evening jog around the neighborhood instead of engulfing a carton of Cheez-Its and watching a “Friends” re-run. And so, hypothetically, a titanic wave of new running enthusiasts is unleashed, extinguishing the rising inferno of chronic illness in America, reducing demand for medical care, increasing the productivity and longevity of the workforce and diminishing the number of people who can’t afford private health insurance because of pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p>The people of America are in dire need of a collective goal to strive for, so why not try to become the fastest country in the world?</p>\n<p><em>Connor Hastings is a master’s student in environmental studies &amp; management.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39038\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-18/prefontaine-plan-key-slimming-americas-waistline/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39038\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-18/prefontaine-plan-key-slimming-americas-waistline/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-18/prefontaine-plan-key-slimming-americas-waistline/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-18/prefontaine-plan-key-slimming-americas-waistline/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-18/prefontaine-plan-key-slimming-americas-waistline/","id":6172,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6171,6170,6169],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Golinger Presents Propaganda, Not Engaging Discourse","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On May 10, I attended an event held at the MultiCultural Center featuring Venezuelan-American editor Eva Golinger who spoke on “21st Century Socialism.” Golinger is an adviser to Hugo Chavez, Vene...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On May 10, I attended an event held at the MultiCultural Center featuring Venezuelan-American editor Eva Golinger who spoke on “21st Century Socialism.” Golinger is an adviser to Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s leader, and a critic of the U.S., her native country. Ms. Golinger spoke about Venezuela’s new socialist policies and the attacks on Chavez in U.S. media. While I don’t expect most readers to have detailed background on Venezuela, Chavez is known to many Americans for his rhetoric criticizing the U.S. This event, organized by the Campus Left among others, should have been a chance for students to see a different perspective on Latin America, a developing region long-dominated by the U.S. However, what we got was nothing short of insulting propaganda espoused by a woman on a payroll.</p>\n<p>Unlike Ms. Golinger, I was born in Venezuela, and my family saw firsthand the changes that occurred. I grew up in California, and though my family environment was quite anti-Chavez, I was young when we left and don’t harbor as much emotional baggage as my family. When I saw the event advertised, I was first astonished, but this gave way to a certain pride that this country and UCSB are open to alternative ideas, which are often simply demonized. I decided to attend, feeling it could be interesting to hear what she had to say, and healthy for me to examine my personal opinions even though I strongly disagree with her.</p>\n<p>While I attended expecting a differing opinion, what I got was two hours of propaganda copied straight from Venezuelan state media. She gave a sermon to the audience promoting Venezuelan policies, disparaging the U.S. and inviting us to purchase her books praising Chavez. While I follow closely what happens in my country of birth, and did research beforehand on her financial ties to the Venezuelan government, the reactions in the audience were outrageous. I believe everyone has a right to political opinions, and although I disagree with it, socialism is a legitimate model when you understand it. However, I’m skeptical that most of those attending had much context on Venezuelan socialism, so I was surprised by the nods and the gasps in the audience to her rhetoric on the revolution and America’s insidious policies. This quickly evolved to outrage when she spoke of how prosperous, free and altruistic Venezuelan society is.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I want to be absolutely clear that, to many, Venezuela is not a free society. There is little freedom of the press as the government controls licensing, and dissidents are threatened or imprisoned. Venezuela’s alliances include Libya, Syria and Iran, some of the most brutal regimes on the planet, and its government has repeatedly been incriminated in aiding Colombian drug terrorists. The expulsion of corporations in the name of reform, along with expensive and wasteful programs to bring millions onto marginal welfare has left the economy bankrupt. Businesses don’t invest, fearing nationalization, and educated, white-collar workers have long since fled. The International Monetary Fund reported that despite having some of the world’s largest oil reserves, Venezuela has the distinction of being the only country in Latin America that is still in deep recession.</p>\n<p>As a Venezuelan-American I was open to hearing the other side, but it is outrageous and inappropriate that a professional propagandist and self-proclaimed “soldier for the revolution” could sermonize on and misconstrue a topic many are uninformed on. I left feeling insulted and concerned that people could eat up her story without context. Golinger is paid to vindicate — with twisted or outright false information — a government that uses repressive practices against its people. We have potential for discourse, but she has little credibility when she enjoys a cushy job as a propaganda outlet. Leftist groups have a right to their beliefs, but I’d caution — it’s easy to be an “armchair” socialist in California without living under the scarcity, fear and tyranny that is reality in Venezuela. I urge individuals to be informed on context, and in the age of media overload, especially wary of packaged information preached to you. I also urge the Campus Left, co-sponsors and the MCC to be more thoughtful on the credibility and agenda of whom they bring to speak.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38667\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-13/golinger-presents-propaganda-engaging-discourse/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38667\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-13/golinger-presents-propaganda-engaging-discourse/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-13/golinger-presents-propaganda-engaging-discourse/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-13/golinger-presents-propaganda-engaging-discourse/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-13/golinger-presents-propaganda-engaging-discourse/","id":6173,"author":{"id":557,"name":"Manuel Gallardo"},"related":[6172,6171,6170],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
