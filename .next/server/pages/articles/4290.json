As early as winter break, students are advised to start thinking about housing and discussing budget with their parents/guardians as appropriate, to determine what would be the best fit for them. Students looking for housing should plan to attend one of the “Housing 101” programs that are offered by University &amp; Community Housing Services (UCHS) in various residence halls during winter quarter. These programs thoroughly cover university-owned and privately-owned community housing options, including deadlines, processes, types of leases, choosing a space and choosing roommates. </span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Begin figuring out who you would like to live with in October. The earlier you start looking the better. Most people find what they are looking for during December, but options remain later on. Smaller places such as one-bedroom apartments get taken up first while larger houses are on the market longer. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What are my housing options (university vs. I.V.)? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For university-owned housing, current first-year students are guaranteed a space in the residence halls; current third-year and fourth-year students also have the option of university-owned apartments, which are guaranteed if they lived in the residence halls for their first two years and they meet the deadlines. For privately-owned options in the community, including Isla Vista, students can access the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for available housing and should plan to attend one of the UCHS Rental Fairs on campus that bring property management companies together with prospective residents.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university offers living arrangements both on and off campus. There are university apartments specifically for upperclassmen and graduate students. Isla Vista also offers many housing options. Both houses and apartments are up for rent. Several co-op houses exist in I.V. as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>How late is too late to look for housing? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s never too late! However, the longer you put it off, the fewer options you will have. There are always options, but you may not find exactly what you are looking for. Looking by December/January just gives the widest range of options.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Is there a best area in I.V. to rent (a.k.a., where to get most of your money)? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It depends on what you are looking for. Typically, the closer a house is to the ocean (Del Playa, Sabado Tarde) the more expensive it will be. Houses closest to campus may also be a bit pricier. However, pricing varies from house to house and depending on the management company. More expensive houses may also offer more amenities and features.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>When do leases in I.V. typically start and end?</b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most leases are from June to June with leases starting at the end of the month and ending shortly after spring finals. Other leases may start in July or even in September before the start of the regular school year. Most leases take place over a 12-month period. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t have anyone in mind to live with? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In university-owned housing, students self-assign themselves into an available vacant space; the other spaces in the room/apartment are filled in by other continuing students through the same self-assignment process or by new incoming students during the summer. For privately-owned community options, students can utilize the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to list themselves as a ‘Roommate Available’ and can also browse through listings of other students who are looking to fill a space in their unit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University housing and many property management companies offer individual contracts for units, meaning you can find housing on your own and you won’t be responsible if one of your roommates leaves the unit. But if you still want to find friends to live with, be sure that you work as roommates. The people you party with may not be ideal to live with. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Editor’s Note</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Additionally, if you’re interested in living in Isla Vista but don’t have people in mind to live with, or are going abroad and will only be in I.V. for one or two quarters, many students post in the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/364409110289576/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Housing Facebook group</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to look for additional people to add onto their lease or for subleasers during the summer or the school year. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t want to live in I.V.? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also options in Goleta and Santa Barbara on the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University housing is the most common alternative though some students choose to live in Goleta. Keep in mind the longer commute and greater distance from the student community. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What are the university-owned apartments like? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pictures, maps, floorspace plans and virtual tours of the </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/residences\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">university-owned apartments are available online here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>When can I apply for UCSB housing as a second, third or fourth year? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing students can find </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/contracts/continuing-students-undergraduate\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application deadlines for university-owned housing here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What should I do before I sign my lease? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students should visit the UCHS office upstairs in the University Center if they would like to have their privately-owned apartment lease reviewed. It is recommended that roommate groups go over the lease together to come up with questions before visiting the UCHS office for review.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask to see the unit in person. Make sure the unit has everything you’re looking for. Spend some time talking to the property managers and develop a relationship. Discuss any parts of the lease needing clarification. Be sure that all your prospective housemates are on board and understand the terms of the lease. Some also find it useful to ask current or previous tenants their experiences living in the unit. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t have a parent to co-sign with me? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students without a co-signer may have different options depending on the management company and who their prospective roommates are. A student without a co-signer can have a roommate’s parent/guardian co-sign for them if they are willing to do so. If that is not an option, the student without a co-signer can talk to the management company to see if they would be willing to increase the security deposit in lieu of the co-signer.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some landlords require students to have a parent co-sign. But usually as long as you can prove your income and ability to pay rent, a parent co-sign is not needed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>What are my rights as a tenant? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS has a </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/student-success-guide\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Success Guide online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that goes over tenants’ rights and responsibilities.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What happens if I have a dispute with my landlord over my security deposit? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students with security deposit disputes can be assisted by UCHS. To avoid disputes, it is HIGHLY recommended that tenants have a move-in and move-out video in order to protect their deposit. For a small fee, UCHS will video the condition of the unit before move-in to document any pre-existing damages and then again at move-out to detail the condition of the unit at the end.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) offers counseling to anyone having a dispute with their landlord including over security deposits! IVTU’s office is on the second floor of Pardall Center. Come by between 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. for free service to UCSB students. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What happens if I want to terminate a lease early? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For privately-owned accommodations in the community, tenants generally need to find a replacement and pay a lease transfer fee in order to terminate their lease early. For university-owned housing, residents also need to find an eligible replacement, unless they cease to be a UCSB student, in which case their lease would likely be terminated.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terminating a lease early can be tricky. The most important thing is to make your landlord aware of your situation. You may be required to find a replacement tenant or continue paying if you leave the home. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How does subleasing work? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you won’t be living at your home for more than a few weeks such as during the summer term or looking for somewhere to live without being a primary tenant, you may want to consider subletting. Many online communities specialize in connecting people looking to sublet to those looking for this type of living arrangement. Landlords have the right to not allow subletting. The landlord may first want to screen the person subletting before allowing the arrangement. From then it depends on your situation whether the person subletting pays rent directly to the landlord or to the main tenant. Be sure which amenities will be provided to the person subletting such as a mattress or other furniture.   </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 9, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91901\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91901\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/","id":4290,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[4289,4288,4287],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[1843,3129,3259,3502,3503,3504,3507,3508,3509,3518,3526,3536,3579,3646,4290,7849],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Lose to CSUN Friday 6-4","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos fall short against CSUN Friday, but get revenge Saturday, winning 12-0 to shutout the Matadors and even the series.

Junior Michael McAdoo and freshman Drew Williams advanced to third and second on a throwing error by the Matador starting pitcher. Junior Sam Cohen sent a single to right field to bring Williams home while a sacrifice fly from freshman Jason Willow would score McAdoo for his 28th run of the year.</p>\n<p>Freshman Brandon Bohning opened the third inning with an extra-base hit and junior Trevor Casanova would hit a sacrifice fly to bring Bohning home after he advanced to third during the previous at-bat. Casanova earned his 28th RBI of the season and brought his team to within one run of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Chris Lincoln started the game for the Gauchos and would only go as far as the fourth inning. With four hits allowed and two earned runs the right handed pitcher, did as well as he could in minimizing the damage from a couple of mistakes on the mound. The sub-five inning start is Lincoln’s first since a Mar. 17 appearance against Sacramento State.</p>\n<p>The Matadors scored a pair of runs in the fifth and sixth innings to gain and pad their lead. Casanova came through for his team again and more specifically his teammate Bohning who would cross the plate again on his single to the right side. Senior Nolan Bumstead would single in Casanova in his at-bat before UCSB was able to get out of the inning down a run, 4-3.</p>\n<p>Senior Alvaro Rubalcaba singled to right center to score senior Riley Conlan before Bohning would get an RBI of his own to score Rubalcaba, and put the tally at 6-3.</p>\n<p>Junior Thomas Rowan would crush a ball over the right field fence in the bottom of the seventh inning for his third homer of the season. The longball put UCSB behind by two, but the deficit was too much to overcome and were not able to put any further damage on the CSUN starter.</p>\n<p>Junior Walker Armstrong went the distance against the Gauchos, giving up four hits and three earned runs over nine innings pitched. The complete game is the right handers second of the season and the marathon effort was good enough to earn him his second win on the year. Despite getting into trouble early on in the game, Armstrong was extremely successful in being able to bear down and prevent UCSB from mounting enough momentum to try to make an attempt to take back the lead after giving it up.</p>\n<p>The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos will play the Cal State University, Northridge Matadors  on Saturday, May 5 at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/","id":4287,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4286,4285,4284],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Beautification Program Provides Work for Local Houseless People","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2020-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image28.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image28.jpg?resize=960%2C540&ssl=1","description":"Part of Ron Moomey’s transition out of houselessness came from a job with the SeeClickFix program in I.V. called Isla Vista Beautiful. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early last year, Ron Moomey was houseless and lived in downtown Santa Barbara’s PATH shelter before moving to Isla Vista, where he occasionally slept in Anisq’Oyo’ Park.

Community Service District (I.V. CSD), hires houseless people and pays them $15 an hour for various cleaning and landscaping tasks, according to Emily Allen, the United Way nonprofit’s director of Homeless and Veterans Impact Initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was homeless, they hired me for this, now I’m not homeless,” Moomey said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said he works around 20 hours a week, responding to the numerous service requests by users of the SeeClickFix app, which can range from graffiti cleanup and cutting overgrown weeds to removing Lime scooters on sidewalks. Anyone can download the SeeClickFix app, take photos of a nuisance in Isla Vista and someone — possibly Moomey — will fix the problem.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since working as the local beautification specialist, Moomey said that he has seen a tangible change in the community, in part from the work he has done so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know a lot of the homeless individuals here. Well, I guess I inspired them; they see what I’m doing picking up trash, doing landscaping stuff. They’ve been cleaning stuff up themselves,” Moomey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey also plans to work with landscaping architect Lynn Kirby on the new Isla Vista Community Center, and he said they are currently deciding on how to landscape the area surrounding the building. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD began using SeeClickFix in April 2019 as part of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pilot program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with United Way. Moomey was one of the original employees and was “critical in getting the project started in Isla Vista,” Allen said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Way originally hired Moomey and one other employee for the program’s launch, but the other person moved to live with family on the East Coast, according to Christina Lydick, former beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista. For a few months, Moomey was the only beautification specialist in the program and responded to most of the service requests, according to Allen. United Way hired two new houseless community members in November 2019, and they started work this January.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the living wage in Santa Barbara County is $16.50 an hour for a working adult with no children, according to the </span><a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06083\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MIT Living Wage Calculator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the minimum wage in the county is $12 an hour for businesses with less than 26 employees and $13 an hour for businesses that employ 26 or more employees. Allen said that although the program is intended as a work experience project, the positions still pay above the minimum wage — $15 — due to the high cost of living. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the pilot program began in April 2019, I.V. Beautiful has completed at least 246 service requests, mostly regarding graffiti abatement, according to Allen. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The city of Santa Barbara is finalizing a partnership with United Way to develop a program based on I.V. Beautiful, according to Allen, who added that she aims to begin the program in late February.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said that he is a part of the talks between the city of Santa Barbara and United Way and that he may work in the downtown area as part of the program.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been asked to do 20 hours a week in Santa Barbara and continue doing 20 hours a week out here,” Moomey said. “I’m going to love it.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><em>A

id=\"caption-attachment-92762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SBCC students have been housed in Tropicana for over 20 years. <em>Andrea Verdugo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tropicana Gardens, the counterpart to Tropicana Del Norte, will now solely house UC Santa Barbara students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift in housing is motivated by the different schedules of the two schools, said Dave Wilcox, executive director of Tropicana Student Living, which manages the two properties. Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) runs on a semester system, starting in August and ending in May, while UCSB works on a quarter system, starting in late September and ending in June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After evaluating our numbers over the past couple of years, [Tropicana Student Living] decided that it was best for all parties to make a change to better support both sets of students,” Wilcox said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, with all the students [in one dorm] attending the same school, everyone can start and end at the same time,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilcox emphasized that there will be no change in the number of SBCC students and UCSB students living in Tropicana Student Living overall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We aren’t adding anything or taking anything away,” Wilcox said. “Overall, we expect our SBCC student numbers and UCSB student numbers to stay roughly the same, with 300 SBCC and 600 UCSB students.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBCC students have been housed in Tropicana for over 20 years, Wilcox explained. The city college doesn’t have any residence halls near its campus, which is located in downtown Santa Barbara, so Tropicana has housed SBCC students who want a residence hall experience, Wilcox said. To get to school, SBCC students can take the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District line 15X from Tropicana Del Norte, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of the housing change, Wilcox said that incoming UCSB and SBCC students will receive the exact same residence hall experience as students have had in the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now we can provide more direct services that are 100% geared towards their specific school,” Wilcox said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tropicana Student Living talked with both SBCC and UCSB administration to inform them of the decision and to see if there could be any negative impacts, but “everyone we spoke with all saw the benefits of making this shift,” Wilcox said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tropicana Del Norte is currently being advertised to SBCC students on the university’s website under the housing section, according to Wilcox. As opposed to living in a house or apartment in Isla Vista, downtown Santa Barbara or the general Santa Barbara area, Wilcox said, “if SBCC students want to have a residence hall experience, Tropicana is the only option available to them.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92761\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/tropicana-del-norte-to-exclusively-house-sbcc-students-next-school-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92761\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/tropicana-del-norte-to-exclusively-house-sbcc-students-next-school-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/tropicana-del-norte-to-exclusively-house-sbcc-students-next-school-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/tropicana-del-norte-to-exclusively-house-sbcc-students-next-school-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/tropicana-del-norte-to-exclusively-house-sbcc-students-next-school-year/","id":4289,"author":{"id":44,"name":"Christina Muoio"},"related":[4288,4287,4286],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
