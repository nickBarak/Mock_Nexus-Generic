Now, it may be the event that takes her to the Olympics.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always had big dreams and [the heptathlon] is what I think will get me there,” Nwaba said. “I’m so blessed [my coach] put me in it. I feel like it was meant to be.”</p>\n<p>In high school, the redshirt junior from University High School in Los Angeles participated in sprints, the high jump and hurdles. Even during her first season here at UCSB, Nwaba simply specialized in the hurdles. Yet, former Track and Field coach Josh Priester saw something more and began training Nwaba in her sophomore season for the heptathlon, a race that takes place over two days and involves seven events: the 100-meter hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200-meter run, long jump, javelin throw and 800 meter run.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Immediately, Nwaba took to the event. She ran her first heptathlon March 13 and 14, 2009 at the Sam Adams Combined Events and earned a score of 4772, breaking the school record of 4767 set by Erika Bornhorst in 1996.</p>\n<p>“My high school coach mentioned [the heptathlon], but I had no idea what it was,” Nwaba said. “Then, [when I was a sophomore], the coach here thought I’d be really good at it. I was really scared, but my first time out I broke the school record, so I was like, ‘I’ll keep with this.’”</p>\n<p>Since then, Nwaba’s success seems endless. In 2010, Nwaba was named an NCAA All-American and broke her own UCSB record twice in the heptathlon, including at the Big West Championships, where Nwaba scored 5,552 and won the event.</p>\n<p>“She’s done so much for the program and you know when she steps onto the track, she’s going to put 110 percent into it,” senior Ryan Martin said. “Pretty much every time she competes, she’s PR’ing. I know she wants to do great things and I think she’s going to.”</p>\n<p>This April at the Sam Adams Multi-Events, Nwaba finished the heptathlon with a phenomenal score of 5,986. The score was not only a personal best for Nwaba, but was good enough to break the overall Big West Conference record. As a result, Nwaba also earned the No. 1 ranking in the nation in the heptathlon.</p>\n<p>“That day was so perfect,” Nwaba said. “Day one went really well — way better than I was expecting. I wasn’t worrying, I was just competing. To see how close I was to 6000, it was a great day.”</p>\n<p>Two weekends ago in the Big West Multi-Event Championships, Nwaba won again with a score of 5,709 and surpassed the conference record set by Sharon Day four years ago in 2008. “I was a little disappointed by the score, but I still broke the record, so I felt I accomplished something,” Nwaba said. “I’ve come a long way. It was good to get a win there because the first time [I competed there,] I came in third.”</p>\n<p>After the victory, Nwaba earned her fourth consecutive Big West Athlete of the Week honors.</p>\n<p>“I remember at the beginning of the year I thought it would be cool to get one [Big West Athlete of the Week award], and now to have four is amazing,” Nwaba said. “I’m happy I’m doing so well this year.”</p>\n<p>While Nwaba has proven to be the best heptathlete to compete at UCSB, she strives for perfection and is never happy with just a win.</p>\n<p>“To get a PR is a good feeling so that reinforces you to keep [training],” Nwaba said. “And I’m competitive with myself.”</p>\n<p>The training is strenuous, but for Nwaba, has always kept practice interesting.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot more hours [of practice] because there are so many events, so it’s so hard to get them all in during the week,” Nwaba said. “It takes a lot of dedication when you have to master seven events, but it’s definitely fun.”</p>\n<p>The determination may pay off, as this summer, Nwaba will have a shot at earning one of three heptathlon spots at the Olympic Games in London. Like most athletes, the Olympics have been the ultimate dream for Nwaba as long as she can remember.</p>\n<p>“In the last Olympics, it [gave] me chills to see [the track athletes] cross the line and win,” Nwaba said. “I want to excel and I know that’s the biggest accomplishment ever, so that pushes me.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba’s dream could very well become a reality. She is currently No. 2 in the nation in the heptathlon behind senior Brianne Theisen. The last two years, Nwaba has also taken a step toward her dream by competing at the USA Nationals. Nwaba placed eighth this year, but knows she can do better.</p>\n<p>“It was defining to be with girls whose scores were so big, but I knew I could do just as well,” Nwaba said. “I started to feel like, ‘I could beat this girl. I can compete with them.’ I didn’t really believe [my dream was possible] until I was competing [there] with the U.S. National Team.”</p>\n<p>Olympic trials will be held in Eugene, Oregon, beginning June 21.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be hard because there are three great heptathletes in the U.S., but she has a chance,” Martin said. “If she competes well in the trials she could do it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Even on the road in Berkeley for the NCAA second round, our fans were louder than the home team’s. That is fucking awesome. The match was not.</p>\n<p>2) Speaking of the loss to Cal, I saw quite a sight afterwards: Chancellor Henry T. Yang and his lovely wife, Dilling, consoling a tearful Big Mike on the sidelines. I feel like there are a number of interactions between the two that I can picture, but that was never one of them.</p>\n<p>3) Gaucho sports have an identity, and it isn’t a good one. Our teams always seem to have the drive, but not the talent. Or the momentum, but then they stumble. Or they finally make an NCAA Championship, and do not make it over the top. I’ve learned to lower my expectations for big games here, because it’s not worth the emotional investment. Until someone proves me wrong and brings home a trophy, I’m going to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>4) Being the boss is the shit. Since the Nexus is completely run by students, the only person who can tell me what to do is the editor in chief. Telling writers and photographers what to do, where to go and by when is a nice preview for the distant future. Unfortunately, starting the day after graduation, it’s right back to the bottom of the totem pole. It’s been real.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I hope I’ve been a satisfactory sports editor for everyone. Based on the website comments, the only thing we do is make errors, so sometimes I’m not sure. I’m not going to say I gave it 100 percent every day. But you know what? I was hovering around 80 percent for almost most of the time.</p>\n<p>Not too bad, if I do say so myself.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40258\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40258\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/nexus-sports-editors-goodbyes-2/","id":3172,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[3171,3170,3169],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ex-Gaucho Excels At World Championships","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Former UCSB sprinter and current Olympian bobsledder Nick Cunningham completed his participation in the World Championships this past weekend, driving his rookie team to finish ahead of a slew of expe...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/bobsled.jpg?resize=267%2C241\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"241\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Former UCSB sprinter and current Olympian bobsledder Nick Cunningham completed his participation in the World Championships this past weekend, driving his rookie team to finish ahead of a slew of experienced veterans in both the two-and four-man bobsled races. Serving as pilot in the World Championships for the first time in his career, Cunningham proved to be an enormous asset to his country and was able to contribute to the United States’ eventual domination in the World Championships (overall the USA took home five medals; four of those were gold).</p>\n<p>In the two-man bobsled event, Cunningham was able to pilot his sled with rookie teammate Dallas Robinson to post an overall time of 3:44.35, good for 9th place out of 26 teams.</p>\n<p>“Just for us to come out there and push as well as we did was kind of a shock to everyone,” said Cunningham. “Nobody thought we were gonna go out there and do that, so now we gotta build off that and … move forward.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the 4-man event, paired with fellow rookies Jesse Beckom, Johnny Quinn and Robinson, Cunningham was able to guide his USA-3 team to times of 5.07 and 5.04 seconds, for overall runs of 54.53 and 54.59 seconds in Lake Placid, N.Y. on Saturday. The team’s total time of 3:39.68 marks Cunningham’s best as a pilot and represents a small sliver of the progressive personal growth that he has undergone since the start of his bobsled career in 2008.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of a stepping stone to what I really want to accomplish overall in the sport … not only … to make a statement for myself and my team, but also to see where I stack up,” Cunningham said.</p>\n<p>On top of his experience gained from this past World Championship, Cunningham also had the joy of being able to witness fellow U.S. bobsledding pilot Steve Holcomb and his other USA-1 representatives capture the Olympic gold medal in both the two-and four-man bobsled races. In doing so, Holcomb became the first person in the history of the sport to finish first in every event he participated in.</p>\n<p>“I was actually their alternate when they won the gold medal back in 2009, so to … watch them ultimately come here and make history by winning the two- and four-man, which has never been done before, is just a really cool thing to watch,” Cunningham said. “It’s motivating to me because even though we’re all on different teams we’re all pretty close.”</p>\n<p>Although Cunningham didn’t place as high as he’d originally hoped, there’s no doubt in his mind that he’ll be back again next year, once again competing for another gold medal to add to his already extensive list of accolades.</p>\n<p>“I’m definitely hungry now. I really wanted a top-10 finish … but that’s racing,” Cunningham said. “It won’t always work out there on race days, so I gotta get out there and get ready for the season and always try to get a little bit faster.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45093\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-29/exgaucho-excels-world-championships/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45093\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-29/exgaucho-excels-world-championships/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-29/exgaucho-excels-world-championships/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-29/exgaucho-excels-world-championships/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-29/exgaucho-excels-world-championships/","id":3173,"author":{"id":324,"name":"Joe Tapiro"},"related":[3172,3171,3170],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
