<p>Police arrested a 20-year-old for cocaine possession, among other charges, in Isla Vista Saturday morning, during which a deputy “pulled out his service weapon,” according to police.</p>\n<p>The individual, Kole Yamashiro, was removed from his vehicle around 7:15 a.m. after deputies from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) observed said vehicle blocking a driveway on the 6600 block of Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>After approaching, deputies removed Yamashiro from the car and called medical officials for an unresponsive female companion who appeared to be suffering from an opioid overdose, according to Kelly Hoover, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Both were determined to be under the influence of a controlled substance, while Yamashiro was found in possession of cocaine and Xanax.</p>\n<p>A deputy then pulled his service weapon when Yamashiro “did not comply with the deputy’s commands regarding reaching into his pocket,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Manuel, a 22-year-old I.V. resident who asked that his last name not be used, initially posted on Facebook after he witnessed the incident.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the Nexus, he said the police had been called because the vehicle was blocking the entrance to his driveway.</p>\n<p>Manuel said he saw no sign of resistance during Yamashiro’s arrest and that the officer had taken “aggressive action.”</p>\n<p>According to Manuel, a police officer “pull[ed] out his gun” and “threatened to shoot [Yamashiro] while he was on the ground.”</p>\n<p>“The male was not armed, was clearly confused to what was happening because he was woken up by the cops,” Manuel said.</p>\n<p>The female, who Manuel said had woken up after police arrested Yamashiro, was shouting that it was Yamashiro’s fault they were locked out of their apartment and subsequently had to sleep in their car, according to Manuel.</p>\n<p>Yamashiro, who is on probation, was officially charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale, being under the influence of a controlled substance and possession of a narcotic.</p>\n<p>He was cited and released approximately 11 hours after the incident.</p>\n<p>It is unknown if Yamashiro is an Isla Vista or Goleta resident because the address provided on Yamashiro’s arrest log does not exist.</p>\n<p>Yamashiro initially enrolled at Santa Barbara City College in Fall 2016, but later withdrew later that quarter. He re-enrolled in Spring 2017, but again dropped his classes.</p>\n<p>Hoover said SBSO does not release body camera footage of an incident for an incident that is currently under investigation, in accordance with Government Code 6254(f).</p>\n<p><i>Updated [Aug. 24]: This article was updated to include Hoover’s statement regarding body camera footage. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Community Services District (CSD), on Nov. 7, 2017 in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Gelb initially<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/isla-vista-landlord-gelb-pleads-not-guilty-to-misdemeanor/\"> pled not guilty</a> to the charge.</p>\n<p>The video, filmed by a friend of Bertrand, shows <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-11/isla-vista-landlord-yells-homophobic-slurs-at-i-v-csd-president-on-state-street/\">Bertrand confronting Gelb</a> about the landlord’s decision to sell all of his I.V. properties, stating Gelb treats his tenants “very poorly.”</p>\n<p>Gelb then follows Bertrand down the 500 block of State Street, shouting profanity and homophobic slurs. He uses the words “fag” and “faggot” several times in the one minute and 34 second video, as well as the phrase “go fuck yourself.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand, who is openly gay, initially said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> that he was “especially disturbed” when Gelb followed him down the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Gelb <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/isla-vista-landlord-leaving-del-playa-drive-after-23-years-lists-properties-for-80-mil/\">made the decision</a> to sell all his properties in I.V. in October 2017. The properties, which Gelb has accumulated over a period of 23 years, are worth more than $80 million.</p>\n<p>Gelb’s lawyer could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>The full video of the incident can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-29/former-i-v-landlord-james-gelb-pleads-guilty-to-misdemeanor-charge-of-disturbing-the-peace/11-7/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>This article will be updated.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
