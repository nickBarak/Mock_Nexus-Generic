Senate members listen intently during their weekly meeting in the Flying A room. <em>Alexander Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night in the UCen’s Flying A room to discuss resolutions on former Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young’s retirement celebration, Gaucho Health Insurance and the campus climate survey.</p>\n<p>After receiving the resolution to celebrate Young’s 25 years as vice chancellor, Young attended Senate and said he was confident in the student body to continue a legacy of upstanding community members.</p>\n<p>“You students, your current generation and those that preceded you have always had a sense of community, had a sense of something bigger and more important than they are, have really always been in my mind on the right side of history,” Young said.  “Students have always been on the right side of history because you think beyond what is the present.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy spoke about a recent Alumni Association meeting in which the possible restructuring of the Division of Student Affairs by moving the location of Career Services to the Alumni Association was discussed.</p>\n<p>“I have to share publicly that I am very opposed to that structural relocation of Career Services,” Guthy said. “Although they were having a preliminary discussion on the idea, I want you to be aware though those discussions are being had.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, she will be meeting with a committee to explore the restructuring further, although no decisions have been made about moving forward with the proposal. Guthy said the move would not solve any existing problems because there is a lack of alumni staff dedicated to Career Services.</p>\n<p>“I am not saying that they couldn’t develop that [staff] over time, but right now they have absolutely no career service,” Guthy said, “I think that it should be controlled by a Department that for years has been focused on undergraduate students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Vice President Angela Lau updated the Senate on last week’s news that the Student Health Board was considering lowering financial aid given to students not enrolled in the Gaucho Health Insurance plan. Lau said a compromise has been reached that will offer financial aid to students enrolled in a private plan equal to the average insurance costs for students insured outside the university plan.</p>\n<p>“There’s going to be a standard that takes the average of how much students usually pay for health insurance and that’s how much will be applied towards financial aid, instead of getting like nothing,” Lau said.</p>\n<p>Guthy also discussed the campus climate survey and said three campus goals regarding increased student services is in progress.</p>\n<p>“The three goals that the University has identified as the most important from that survey were working to create better services for LGBTQ identified students and underrepresented minorities on campus, sexual assault prevention and the aftermath and staff morale,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s meeting, senators also approved a resolution directing the A.S. Ticket Office to undergo the i&gt;clicker rental program, sent the 24 hour café resolution to committee, discussed greener alternatives to blue test booklets and passed the A.S. Legal Code update.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thurday, February 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Internal Vice President Angela Lau discussed the Student Health Board’s plan to reduce financial aid for students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance.</p>\n<p>“What they want to do is reduce financial aid packages for students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance. Currently around 50 percent of students waive Gaucho health insurance,” said Lau. “However they don’t account for the fact that currently, to be a student at UCSB you are required to have health insurance.”</p>\n<p>According to Lau, the Student Health Board’s new plan will financially hurt students, many of whom struggle to pay for tuition and school expenses already.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t really make sense to reduce financial aid for not having Gaucho Health Insurance when you’re making every student have it,” Lau said, “Essentially that means that they’re penalizing students for not using the Gaucho Health Insurance brand by reducing their financial aid package.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting Senator Zach Goulhiane of the UCen Governance Board reported that changes are being made to the campus mail system so that first-year students living in the Santa Catalina dorms will have to collect their mail at the UCen post office.</p>\n<p>“They’re planning on spending $93,000 to re-do pretty much all the P.O. boxes for the freshmen so all the FT mailboxes, all the University-owned mailboxes will be moved here [the UCen],” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>According to Goulhaine, the move is directed to increase foot traffic around UCen businesses and to simplify mail distribution.</p>\n<p>“They’re trying to get more traffic into the UCen so that more people will go around the bookstore and whatnot buying stuff here,” Goulhiane said, “And that way they centralize all the mail because now apparently it takes them a while to send it out.”</p>\n<p>Also during meeting, A.S. Recycling Program member Sam Breyfogle outlined the organization’s proposal to update recycling bin signs to reflect a new comingled recycling program that aims to provide specific instructions for waste management. The proposal is seeking funds from The Green Initiative Fund, a student-supported fund that funds eco-friendly projects on campus.</p>\n<p>“They [bins] were installed about 20 years ago. They currently say ‘newspapers, aluminum, plastic,’ and ‘glass’ as well as ‘trash,’” Breyfogle said. “We’d like to get signs that say ‘comingled recycling’ and underneath that a sign that lists out what can be recycled.”</p>\n<p>Breyfogle also said the organization wants to upgrade the BigBelly trashcans on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’d like to buy new bins for the interiors of the berthas,” Breyfogle said, “Many of the bins have holes bit through by rodents causing them to leak and make a complete mess of the interior.”</p>\n<p>After further discussion surrounding Gaucho Health Insurance, the Senate heard from A.S. Controller Amir Khazaieli about updates surrounding the iClicker rental program.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli explained that the goal is to make iClickers free for students to rent, but there will be a suggested $5 donation upon returning the iClicker to keep the program sustainable.</p>\n<p>“Based off our research, students are highly inclined if not really ecstatic to provide up to $5 to the association for providing such a service if it meant that that money was going to go to expanding such a service,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli addressed the specific concern of the $7 re-registration fee for students on used iClickers and suggested that donations generated from the $5 program could reduce the fee. Khazaieli also suggested potentially “striking a deal” with iClicker to get reduced rates.</p>\n<p>A.S. will be holding a finance meeting on Monday to “secure funding for the program,” according to Khazaieli.</p>\n<p>“If revenues are generated from the iClicker program … that money can go towards subsidizing this,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>The meeting concluded with senators passing two resolutions in support of a tuition hike op-ed and a BigBelly label and bin upgrade.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the February 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I understand we are a beach college but a lot of Greeks are the most intimidated by the LGBTQ community.”</p>\n<p>Escobar-Henry said publicly admitting your sexual orientation as gay can lead to negativity from those who oppose the gay community.</p>\n<p>“I feel that ‘coming out’ is definitely a gateway to have hatred towards you,” Escobar-Henry said. “The hatred comes from ignorance and making jokes out of LGBTQ people in the media and public.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English and film &amp; media studies major Chloe Babauta also spoke on the panel and said because of her bisexual identity she has been followed and verbally assaulted in I.V.</p>\n<p>“One time, I was walking down the street in Isla Vista with a girl,” Babauta said. “I was holding her hand and was followed. Another time, I was with my lesbian friends and men tried to make me make-out with them. I felt threatened and in danger. This is why I do not party in Isla Vista anymore.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60634\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60634\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/campaign-presents-panel-of-lgbtq-students/","id":2911,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2910,2909,2908],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dept. of Sociology To Celebrate 50 Years of Grad Program","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Sociology_Stephen-Manga.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Sociology_Stephen-Manga.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Department of Sociology will host a research conference this Friday and Saturday to celebrate the graduate program’s 50th anniversary.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Department of Sociology will host a research conference this Friday and Saturday to celebrate the graduate program’s 50th anniversary.</p>\n<p>The two-day conference will be held in the Corwin Pavilion on Friday and at the Mosher Alumni House on Saturday and will feature a number of speakers and research presentations from universities across the country, including an introduction by Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The department was recently ranked number one in the country by the online database College Factual ranking last month.</p>\n<p>Sociology Department chair and professor Maria Charles said the conference is aimed at celebrating the milestone while also reflecting upon the department’s work in the field.</p>\n<p>“Our Ph.D. program was founded in the 1964-65 academic year, so one reason is to celebrate the major milestone, and the other reason is to consider UCSB’s Department of Sociology’s intellectual contributions, particularly looking at fields in which we have had [an] intellectual role in over the years,” Charles said.</p>\n<p>According to the conference’s program, topics that will be presented include but are not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, culture, globalization, ethnography, conversation analysis and social movements. Charles said she is excited to see the presentations on issues that have significant implications for society.</p>\n<p>“The speakers will be reflecting on the development of certain sociological subfields over the past 50 years,” Charles said. “We’re also looking at the impact of the department in terms of contributions to broader social good, because our faculty is very interested in doing research that is socially relevant and that address important social problems of today.”</p>\n<p>According to Charles, 10 former department chairs will be attending the event in addition to current sociology professors. Sociology graduate student Corrie Ellis said she decided to help coordinate the event and bring back former faculty for the opportunity to meet past faculty and department chairs and reflect on the history of the department.</p>\n<p>“I really got to know and interview some of the sociology faculty that has made UCSB sociology what it is today,” Ellis said. “It’s a special opportunity for all of us and especially graduate students to learn about the history of UCSB sociology, which I think is a very radical history and I’m very proud to be part of it.”</p>\n<p>According to Ellis, after talking to former faculty and chairs, she and another graduate student developed a timeline of faculty and chairs that will be displayed at the conference.</p>\n<p>UCLA sociology professor Steven Clayman, who received his Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology, said he is excited for the graduate program and looks forward to commemorating his alma mater.</p>\n<p>“I’m very proud to have come from that world-class program and it’s really great that they are now reaching their 50th anniversary,” Clayman said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60840\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60840\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/dept-of-sociology-to-celebrate-50-years-of-grad-program/","id":2912,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2911,2910,2909],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
