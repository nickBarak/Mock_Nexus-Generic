If UCSB hopes to outpace a dangerous Davis offense this time around, they might need another solid night from Williams.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Corey Hawkins leads Davis and the Big West in scoring with 19.4 points per game. Last time out against Santa Barbara, Hawkins scored 23 points on an efficient 7-11 from the field. Earlier this season against Hawaii, Hawkins led the Aggies to a 93-82 victory by registering a career-high and school record 40 points.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to keep him under control,” Coach Williams said. “We can’t let him go off like he did at Hawaii. We have to be aware of where he is and not let him have easy looks.”</p>\n<p>During the four-game losing streak, UCSB had a chance to win every game but came up short in each. The four losses came by a combined total of 15 points, the last two each by a two-point margin.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big weekend for us right now,” Big Al said. “We’ve got to go out there and string some wins together [and] try to get some momentum for the end of the season.”</p>\n<p>When UCSB previously faced Davis, sophomore guard T.J. Taylor was the only other Gaucho to score in double figures aside from Williams with 10 points. Santa Barbara will need to see plenty of scoring from junior guard Kyle Boswell and freshman forward Taran Brown this time around if it wants to beat Davis.</p>\n<p>One of the major emphases for UCSB entering tonight’s game will be slowing down Davis’ outside game, as the Aggies are one of the top shooting teams in the conference. Davis ranks second in the Big West in free throw percentage, field-goal percentage and three-point percentage, highlighting the Aggies as a dangerous and efficient team from anywhere on the floor.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 7th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As UCSB is desperate to win at home, Fullerton might be the perfect opponent considering that the Titans are 1-6 on the road.</p>\n<p>“[At home], it’s not just basketball,” Mitchell said. “They’re still going to class, they’re around their friends and they have family in the stands. Is that added pressure? It shouldn’t be, but it’s like missing one free throw. It’s contagious and now we have an epidemic that we are continuing to battle at home. If you’ve seen us play on the road to watching us play on the road, we’re a totally different team.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton also lost last night, falling in a 78-40 blowout against Cal Poly. It was the fourth straight loss for the Titans, who currently stand at 3-5 in conference and 7-13 overall.</p>\n<p>Like Riverside, Fullerton is led by its guards. Sophomore guard Chante Miles paces the team offensively with 12.4 points per game, which ranks ninth in the Big West. She also averages 3.5 assists per game and 2.6 steals per contest, good enough for fifth and third in the league, respectively.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton’s tough,” Mitchell said. “They have lightning quick guards, a lot like Riverside. And they’re going to play us a combination of pressure man-to-man and 2-3 zone. So it’ll be close to what we saw tonight (against Riverside).”</p>\n<p>Against Riverside, UCSB was unable to handle the defensive pressure. The Gauchos turned the ball over 17 times compared to the Highlanders’ 12 and points off turnovers favored Riverside 20-6.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it came down to that last possession. I think over the course of the game we made little mistakes that in the end, cost us the game,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We knew that Riverside brings a good defensive presence and it’s about being strong with the ball and making the easy passes and we had a little bit of a tough time.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got off to a quick start, taking an early 11-5 lead due to 41.7 percent shooting. However, Riverside went on a 10-0 run sparked by junior center Natasha Hadley as she scored eight points during the run, erasing UCSB’s lead. Santa Barbara would never lead the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Hadley led all scorers with 20 points while also grabbing eight rebounds. She dominated the paint as the Highlanders outscored the Gauchos 22-8 in the paint.</p>\n<p>“[Hadley] shoots the ball extremely high, so a double team at the end of the day’s not even going to affect her,” Mitchell said. “We tried to body her up, but we didn’t have an answer.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to climb back into the game and get within four, but a 6-0 by Riverside gave them their largest lead of the game at 41-31 with 5:12 remaining.</p>\n<p>That’s when the Gauchos turned up the intensity. UCSB went on an 8-0 run to close the gap to two points at 43-41 with just under a minute left.</p>\n<p>On the next possession, senior guard Angelei Aguirre came up with the steal. Nesbit drove the ball through the right side of the paint and drew the foul with 13 seconds remaining in the game, sending Santa Barbara’s best free throw shooter and second best in the Big West at 86.2 percent to the line to try to tie the ball game.</p>\n<p>However, Nesbit missed the first free throw. After making the second, the Gauchos were forced to foul senior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham, the Big West’s best free throw shooter at 86.4 percent. She sunk both, leaving UCSB down three with seven seconds to go.</p>\n<p>Forced to run the full length of the court, the Gauchos were unable to execute offensively and failed to get a shot off, losing 45-42. Riverside improved to 10-9 overall and 3-5 in conference play.</p>\n<p>“We were wanting to get the ball into Angelei Aguirre,” Mitchell said. “We had a flair screen set up for Nic to come to the top for a shot and the timing was just bad.”</p>\n<p>Along with turnovers, free throws cost Santa Barbara the game. Although UCSB ranks second in the Big West in free throw percentage, averaging 73.4 percent, the Gauchos shot just 56.3 percent from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a matter of relaxing and knocking them down,” senior Sweets Underwood said., who notched her seventh double-double of the season with 14 points and 11 rebounds. “It’s nothing different. It’s on us at the end of the day.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Fullerton Saturday is set for 2 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of February 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49970\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/keeping-the-streak-alive/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49970\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/keeping-the-streak-alive/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/keeping-the-streak-alive/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/keeping-the-streak-alive/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/keeping-the-streak-alive/","id":665,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[664,663,662],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins 40th Straight Against CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Usually when Head Coach Carlene Mitchell makes her patented five-man line change, she’s looking for an increase in intensity, which is exactly what she got.

The Titans, on the other hand, drop to 3-6 in league and 7-14 overall.</p>\n<p>“Typically when we win, I can say it’s a total team effort, but today I can say it and truly mean it with the numbers,” Mitchell said. “Today, the second unit helped us pull off this win, so I’m extremely proud of the focus and intensity they came in with.”</p>\n<p>Pacing Santa Barbara offensively was senior center Kirsten Tilleman, who exploded for a season-high 16 points on 4-7 shooting and 8-8 from the free throw line. She also contributed a game-high eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to win,” Tilleman said. “The disappointing loss from Thursday (against ninth place Riverside) was fresh on our memories and we wanted to go out there and play with a lot of intensity.”</p>\n<p>Down 5-3 to start the game, senior forward Sweets Underwood converted a three-point play to spark an 11-0 run for UCSB. By halftime, the Gauchos extended their lead to 28-18. Fullerton’s 18 first-half points mark the seventh time this season UCSB has kept an opponent to fewer than 20 points in the first half.</p>\n<p>As Fullerton is a team known for its quick guards, the Gauchos took advantage inside, using their high-low game to open up the offense. On the game, Tilleman and Underwood combined for 26 points and 15 of UCSB’s 28 first-half points.</p>\n<p>“We understand we have to go inside out,” Mitchell said. “It allows the guards to settle down and knock down open jumpers.”</p>\n<p>Although, up 10 in the second half, offensive boards and second-chance points allowed Fullerton to climb back into the game. They went on a 14-4 run, knotting the game at 40 apiece with 10:16 to go.</p>\n<p>On the game, Fullerton outrebounded Santa Barbara 40-30, including 20-4 on the offensive glass, which resulted in 23 second-chance points for the Titans compared to six for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We’re lucky to have pulled this game out giving up 20 offensive rebounds,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes we had mismatches but there’s no excuse. At the end of the day, we do rebounding drills every day, so I don’t care if you’re 5’2’’ blocking out 6’5’’.”</p>\n<p>With the score tied, Mitchell inserted her bench, which immediately upped the intensity. Freshman guard Jasmine Ware stole the ball and went coast-to-coast for a lay-up, jump-starting a 12-4 Gaucho run.</p>\n<p>“I want the ones coming off the bench to know that you always have to be ready and have your mind in the game,” Mitchell said. “I saw that they were ready to compete and weren’t backing down, so I was going to go with them.”</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos outshot the Titans 52.6 percent to 27.6 percent.</p>\n<p>Next for UCSB is a road trip north to Davis Thursday and Pacific Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 4th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49994\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/ucsb-wins-40th-straight-against-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49994\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/ucsb-wins-40th-straight-against-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/ucsb-wins-40th-straight-against-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/ucsb-wins-40th-straight-against-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/ucsb-wins-40th-straight-against-csuf/","id":666,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[665,664,663],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Day in the Life of Kirsten Tilleman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the UCSB roster, Kirsten Tilleman is listed as a senior, but she is definitely no ordinary student athlete.

One of two players to start every game she’s played in, she’s a vital part of the Gaucho squad, averaging 30.5 minutes per game, which is second on the team.</p>\n<p>Tilleman is also one of Santa Barbara’s best defenders. She ranks second on the team and fourth in the Big West in defensive rebounds, grabbing 5.3 boards per game (averages 7.3 total) and is tied for first on the team in steals with 0.9 per contest. Finally, with 0.7 blocks per game, she leads the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>So how does Tilleman do it all? Well, her formula is, “basketball, school, dinner, (school) work, repeat.” Obviously it’s not that simple though, so I was given the opportunity to shadow Tilleman for a day and see what a day in her shoes is really like.</p>\n<p>It’s Monday morning and Tilleman’s day starts at the Thunderdome. She gets there at 8:30 a.m., which is a bit earlier than usual because the team has to retake its team picture.</p>\n<p>Afterward, they change into practice gear and head into the film room, where they look at the game they played two days before in Hawaii (a 51-50 victory that handed Hawaii its first home loss during conference play). Head Coach Carlene Mitchell examines the team’s man defense, missed block-outs, screen-and-roll plays and more. A win is a win, but there’s still plenty to work on.</p>\n<p>They also go over their basketball tests, a test given by Mitchell to look at the player’s basketball IQs. Sitting in the back left corner of the room, Tilleman is quick to answer any questions asked by Mitchell, exemplifying her comprehensive knowledge of the game.</p>\n<p>Practice starts just before 10:00, beginning with warm-ups and stretches. Tilleman leads the pack and is the first to get to the ball rack when the players are instructed to start shooting drills. Since coming to UCSB, Tilleman — one of the team captains this year — has been known to lead by example with her blue-collar mentality.</p>\n<p>She dons a blue practice jersey, the straps tucked into her sports bra. On the back reads the number 32; it’s the number she’s worn all her life and the number her mom wore.</p>\n<p>On the first shooting drill, which involves grabbing a ball out of a chair, ripping and then taking a lay-up or jump shot, Tilleman makes all her lay-ups but the last one. She still made 90 percent of them, but as Mitchell looks over and sees Tilleman miss, the sound of “finish Tilleman” echoes through the gym.</p>\n<p>While she’s not taking her turn, she encourages her teammates. As she continues to run through the multiple shooting drills, her shot looks consistent. Nevertheless, as she misses a couple in a row, she mumbles a cuss word under her breath. It’s one of the charming things I’ve learned to look for while watching Tilleman play over the past year-and-a-half.</p>\n<p>Not to say that Tilleman goes around swearing all the time — because she certainly does not — but she’s a perfectionist, and her efforts produce results. Currently, last year’s Big West Tournament MVP is averaging 5.5 points per game and shooting 51.4 percent in conference play. In UCSB’s most recent game against Cal State Fullerton, Tilleman exploded for a season-high 16 points and eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>Moving onto power layups, Tilleman’s power is apparent. She might not be the quickest or the most athletic, but she is strong, physical and knows how to use her body.</p>\n<p>Next on the practice agenda is going through all the offensive patterns. She’s vocal while running plays, constantly communicating with her teammates.</p>\n<p>Then, while sitting out, the second group makes a mistake on a play. From about halfcourt where the rest of the players are standing, Tilleman is very vocal. She points and yells where they need a ball screen and I can finally see for myself how she’s grown as a vocal leader.</p>\n<p>Practice ends after about an hour. While drills are at game speed, Mitchell decides to run a short practice considering the team got back to Santa Barbara from its trip to Hawaii the morning before after a red-eye flight.</p>\n<p>We walk over to the ICA where Tilleman gets started on weights around 11:00. We’re ahead of most of the team as Tilleman knows she’s got things to do and doesn’t want to waste time. She works through a circuit of exercises, including slides with a rubber band around her ankles, squats and abs.</p>\n<p>During the exercises, Tilleman can laugh and talk with her teammates and I catch glimpses of that infectious smile. She balances socializing and working, never falling off task. After about a half hour, she heads into the training room to do some exercises for her knees because, as she said herself, “my knees suck.”</p>\n<p>With the basketball portion of the day done, we walk over to the other side of campus where the Bren School is located. She takes me out to Deckers Deck, which has an amazing view of the ocean. We eat lunch there and talk. She has a leftover sweet potato curry dish for lunch, which smelled amazing. Tilleman loves to cook; it’s one of the things she does to take a break from her schoolwork. After all, you have to eat.</p>\n<p>The conversation flows easily; she’s so personable and genuine. Despite me following her, she tried to make me feel comfortable the entire day.</p>\n<p>She explains how she graduated in three years from Oregon State University, but only played two years of basketball. While she completely supports the program now, it wasn’t the right fit for her and so she decided to take her last year off and study hard to graduate in three years, leaving her with two years of NCAA eligibility. She eventually decided on UCSB, based on its master’s program first and basketball program second, wanting a program in which she could make an impact and make a run to the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>Tilleman tries not to talk about herself too much because she doesn’t want to seem conceited. She’s definitely far from being arrogant, but she does throw in that she was a Rhodes Scholarship finalist for District 16 this past fall, an award that combines athletic ability, leadership and academics. While still gracious, her competitive nature comes through. She doesn’t like losing.</p>\n<p>At 1:00 p.m., we head to Tilleman’s only class of the day: ESM 276, or Ethical Decision-Making for the Environment — a two-unit, five-week short course. It’s a much different setup than an undergrad classroom. There are only 15 to 20 people sitting around a conference-style table, not desks.</p>\n<p>Overall, the class is much more applied with a lot more discussion. They applied different ethical models learned in class to different real-world concepts. For example, the class discussed the Tigers Woods scandal and why, unlike the rest of his sponsors, Nike decided to keep him. Beyoncé even came up, too.</p>\n<p>The class ends at 2:15 p.m., after which we head down to the visitors center, where Tilleman is scheduled to meet with her group at 2:30 p.m. to work on their master’s thesis project. At Bren, the GP (for group project) as Tilleman calls it, is done in groups and is unique in that their paper will be able to be used; it won’t just sit on a shelf.</p>\n<p>Tilleman’s master’s program is a two-year program with the master’s thesis being a spring-to-spring project. After finishing the paper, she will have to defend her thesis on March 1, meaning she has to leave the team in between games during its Fullerton and Riverside road trip.</p>\n<p>The project involves coming up with a public access plan for Tejon Ranch, a 270,000 acre ranch north of Bakersfield. In 2008, an agreement was made that said the ranch would conserve 90 percent of its lands as well as create and fund a conservancy (Tilleman’s group’s client) to manage the land. Their product, along with the work of the conservancy, will be the public access plan of the ranch. The overarching mission for Tilleman and her group is to make the resource available to the public while maintaining the integrity of the ranch.</p>\n<p>The first thing Tilleman does is get caught up on what she’s missed during the group’s previous meeting and weekend trip to the ranch due to travelling with the team.</p>\n<p>While Tilleman seems very passionate about her project — and it’s certainly clear she’s put a ton of work, time and effort into it — I see a bit of stress on her face as she knows the paper isn’t magically going to just come together. The group has set an internal deadline to have the paper done by Feb. 10 so they then can have time to edit before sending it off to ‘defense.’ As she said, “we’re in crunch time.”</p>\n<p>During her group meeting is where I could truly tell the difference between grad and undergrad work as information started flying over my head. There’s so much they have to consider with their project. That day alone, they discussed trails and hikes, such as a loop trail for their case study, how to label them, where to put them and more.</p>\n<p>Finally, after meeting for about two hours, we head back to Tilleman’s apartment. It seems like a peaceful place for her where she can just get work done (there’s no TV). She makes both of us tea from Montana, exhibiting her motto “when in doubt, drink tea.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the day, her passion for the environment is clear. While she’s not 100 percent certain of her path after graduating in the spring, she’s interested in working in city government and dealing with water management or land use for recreational purposes.</p>\n<p>For my last question of the day, I ask her how she manages everything. Her response is simple, but speaks the truth: “You just make time.” While it can be difficult, like on road trips when there’s no electrical outlet on the bus so her computer will die, making homework virtually impossible to do, she knows what she has to do and makes those things her priorities.</p>\n<p>But here’s the difference between Tilleman and the majority of students at UCSB: She isn’t just making time and she isn’t just doing a lot. She’s doing it all extremely well.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of the February 6th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50135\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50135\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/a-day-in-the-life-of-kirsten-tilleman/","id":667,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[666,665,664],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
