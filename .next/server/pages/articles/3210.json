The unthinkable happened. The 34 year old maestro, the five-time champion, two-time Olympic gold medalist, the man with the fourth most points in NBA history sat on the floor of the Staples Center holding his foot. You could see a grimace on his face that most Laker fans have learned to ignore.</p>\n<p>He’s going to get up. He’s going to go to the free throw line, knock down two clutch free throws, get back on defense and get us through this game. He might even limp.</p>\n<p>He did what most of us expected. He came out of the timeout, walked to the free throw line, and he made two free throws to tie the game with just over three minutes remaining. Only this time, he didn’t get back on defense. His eyes were red. It was obvious he was holding back tears. He limped off the court and into the locker room. The result was a torn Achilles tendon.</p>\n<p>Kobe Bryant has pushed his body to its physical limits year after year. He has been described as more than just a basketball player, but a warrior, and often regarded as the toughest player in the NBA.</p>\n<p>So, how fitting then that the only weakness of the legendary, indestructible warrior Achilles would be the only thing that could stop the greatest warrior of this era.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, nothing made sense in Lakerland.</p>\n<p>After two depressing years in which the previously top of the world Lakers were run out of the second round of the playoffs, one of the greatest franchises in basketball had seemingly found its way back to the top by acquiring future hall of famer Steve Nash and the most dominant big man in basketball in Dwight Howard.</p>\n<p>However, the dream quickly turned into a nightmare. After a 1-4 start to a year that was supposed to be one of the greatest in the team’s glorious history, the Lakers found themselves in disarray.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to January. The Lakers are 17-25 and Pau Gasol and Dwight Howard continue to miss games with various injuries. The only constant, as he has been since 1996, is Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Then, something changed, and the Lakers started to win. Kobe would go on to have one of his greatest seasons ever, averaging over 27 points a game for the ninth time in his career, tying his career high with 6 assists per game, and shooting the ball more efficiently than he has in years.</p>\n<p>Kobe hit the winning shot against the Hawks in a must-win game. Three days later, he brought his team back from down 25 points at New Orleans, a game where his teammates once again failed to play with the fire needed to make the playoffs.</p>\n<p>He followed it up two nights later with miraculous shot after miraculous shot against Toronto, ending in another game-winning shot.</p>\n<p>With five games left in the season, Kobe vowed not to come off the court again. If the Lakers won their remaining games, they would clinch a playoff spot, something that seemed unreachable three months earlier.</p>\n<p>The Lakers won one game. The next night, they played in the Rose Garden in Portland, an arena they rarely win in. In 48 minutes, Kobe had 47 points, eight rebounds, five assists, four block shots, and three steals, becoming the first player to ever put up a stat line like that.</p>\n<p>With three games remaining, the Lakers returned home to play the Golden State Warriors. They trailed for most of the game, but with just minutes left they still had a chance. Kobe nailed a deep jumper to bring the Lakers within three with under five minutes to go.</p>\n<p>A minute later, he took a classic “Kobe shot:” a deep, 29-foot, stand-still three to tie the game with a defender in his face. He made it.</p>\n<p>The next time he touched the ball, he made his final move, one that after the game he said he’s made “a million times.” He had played every minute of every game for almost three weeks, but on this night, his body gave out on him.</p>\n<p>The Lakers would go on to win their remaining games and make it to the playoffs, where they were swept by the much superior San Antonio Spurs.</p>\n<p>Kobe underwent successful surgery to repair his achilles, and was originally diagnosed as out six to nine months. Many players never come back from this injury, and those that do have found it very difficult to perform at a high level.</p>\n<p>If there’s anyone that can do it, though, it’s Kobe Bryant. While the numbers of his dwindling number of peers who played in the ‘90s, such as Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan and Steve Nash, have fallen steadily, Kobe has somehow kept his production consistent.</p>\n<p>If there’s anything his teary-eyed interview which directly followed his injury tells us, it’s how much he cares. The undeniable, unbreakable emotion is still there. The fire, will and inhuman competitive spirit is still there.</p>\n<p>Every doubter that he’s ever had, he’s silenced. He’s stepped up to every challenge he’s been faced with since joining the league at the age of 17. In 2003, someone said that his daughter was a better shooter than Kobe. The Mamba answered that by breaking the NBA record with 12 three-pointers in a single game, a record that still stands today.</p>\n<p>That’s just who he is. He won’t stop fighting because he doesn’t know how. He already has a head-start on the recovery process by studying from the fastest recoveries from this dreaded injury and promising to “do it better.” He’s shooting for a return to the court by the end of October, the start of what just might be his final season.</p>\n<p>He will prove the doubters wrong again. He will come back not as a shell of his former self, but as formidable a force as he has ever been. He will continue to be Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of http://blackmambablog.edublogs.org</em></p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51660\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/kobe-bryant-down-but-not-out/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51660\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/kobe-bryant-down-but-not-out/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/kobe-bryant-down-but-not-out/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/kobe-bryant-down-but-not-out/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/kobe-bryant-down-but-not-out/","id":3210,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3209,3208,3207],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Rose Smart For Sitting Amid Playoffs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Having LeBron James on your team doesn’t guarantee you an automatic victory, as evidenced by the Chicago Bulls stealing game one of the Eastern Conference semifinals from the Miami Heat.

Similarly, having Derrick Rose on your team won’t guarantee you a win either.</p>\n<p>It’s been over a year since Rose tore up his knee in last year’s postseason. Yet, the Bulls have managed the entire season without him and are in just as good of a position right now compared to if he were in the lineup. Cleared by doctors to play two months ago, the lingering question remains: Why hasn’t he stepped on the court yet?</p>\n<p>In sports, we’re constantly reminded of the heroism that comes with playing injured. Images of a hobbling Willis Reed walking onto the court with a torn thigh muscle in game seven or Michael Jordan scoring 38 points while playing with a 103 degree fever in the NBA Finals will forever remain etched in basketball lore. However, Rose and the Bulls have taken a completely different approach to handling their situation, and that is to sit and wait until Rose is completely ready.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Skeptics argue that Rose is being selfish and putting himself before the team. With teammates like Joakim Noah battling with plantar fasciitis and still willing the Bulls to the semis, Rose’s toughness and dedication has been questioned.</p>\n<p>But what Rose is doing is the right choice not just for himself but also for the Bulls organization. For a player that is only 24 years old, there is no need for him to risk coming back from a career threatening-injury for a slim chance of defeating the Heat in a seven-game series. Let’s face it, the Bulls caught Miami by surprise in game one, but don’t count on that happening again.</p>\n<p>With the year Adrian Peterson had still fresh in our minds, it’s difficult to remember the numerous instances where other athletes never recovered from this injury, such as Olympian Michael Redd, who had his career cut short because of the ACL tear he suffered.</p>\n<p>The underlying issue here is not whether Rose is physically ready to play but whether he is mentally prepared to take the court. A player cannot be effective if he doesn’t trust his own knee to make sharp cuts and is repeatedly fearful of re-injury. The real topic of concern here with Rose is when he will finally be ready to get past that final mental hurdle; obviously, he still isn’t there yet.</p>\n<p>Let’s not forget what the other Bulls players have done in the playoffs either. While the basketball world was shocked that the Bulls went into Miami with one day of rest after defeating the Nets in seven games, the Bulls, on the other hand, were not surprised at all. They expected to win.</p>\n<p>Noah and Jimmy Butler combined for 34 points with 25 rebounds in game one, and Nate Robinson filled the role of the go-to guy for Chicago, scoring 27 points on 50 percent shooting. Chicago stuck to its game plan, and that is to play physically against an undersized Heat front court. They finished with a 46-32 advantage on the boards and outscored Miami 40-32 in the paint. If the Bulls continue to do this throughout the series, James and company will have to wait for ring number two until next year.</p>\n<p>Miami has much more to worry about than wondering if Rose will come back and play in the series because in all likelihood, Rose probably will not see any action in this round of the playoffs or for the rest of the postseason. However, when he does come back, all eyes will be on him and his knee.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51262\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51262\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/","id":3207,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[3206,3205,3204],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LeBron James Deserved A Unanimous MVP","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For those of you that follow NBA basketball, it was absolutely no surprise that LeBron James of the Miami Heat won the prestigious MVP award.

He becomes just the fifth player to win a fourth MVP award, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six MVPs), Michael Jordan (five), Bill Russell (five) and Wilt Chamberlain (four). Those, of course, are some of the greatest names in basketball history and James’s achievements put him in their company. What’s more, as James is just in his 10th year in the league at just 28 years old, James could even pass these all-time greats.</p>\n<p>Winning back-to-back MVPs is not easy. Many people don’t think the same player should earn it in consecutive years regardless of whether or not that player was the best that year, but there was no taking that award away from James this year.

It should have been unanimous. He deserved for it to be unanimous.</p>\n<p>It would have been the first ever unanimous MVP vote. There have certainly been some unbelievable players in this league, but of course, there is always competition. This year though, James was simply that much better than anyone else.</p>\n<p>The MVP voting panel is made up of 120 sports journalists and broadcasters, with one vote also being an online fan vote. Obviously, there was one journalist who wasn’t so objective and failed in doing his/her job correctly.</p>\n<p>In my lifetime of basketball, I have never watched a player that I felt was head and shoulders above the rest enough to deserve the honor of an undisputed vote, but this year, it should’ve happened.</p>\n<p>Part of this is due to injuries. Many candidates throughout the season fell out of the race due to injury, such as Chris Paul or Tony Parker. Then take out Kobe Bryant having a chance to win simply because his team barely made the playoffs.</p>\n<p>That left James mainly in a one-man race with Kevin Durant. However, I am certainly not implying that James was simply handed the award; he completely earned it. Even halfway through the season, it seemed he was going to be the dead-obvious winner.</p>\n<p>This year, James became the first ever NBA player to go six straight games scoring at least 30 points while shooting at least 60 percent from the field. If that wasn’t enough, he became the youngest player in NBA history to reach the 20,000 point plateau for his career. Then, he took five of the six Eastern Conference Player of the Month awards.</p>\n<p>Also, James is now the second player in league history to post at least 2,000 points, 600 rebounds, 500 assists and 100 steals in a season twice, with Larry Bird doing it three times. The only other player to ever accomplish such a feat once was Michael Jordan.</p>\n<p>James wasn’t just taking easy shots either. He’s become a smart player offensively with time, becoming the second player in NBA history to shoot 55 percent from the field and 40 percent from behind the arc, joining Chris Mullin.</p>\n<p>With such a spectacular season, who could have possibly earned that other first-place vote? It would be natural to think it was Kevin Durant, since he did come in second in MVP voting and had a great year.</p>\n<p>But no. It went to Carmelo Anthony from the New York Knicks, who finished third in the voting. This is where nothing makes sense, except for the fact that perhaps there is a New York reporter who has some beef with James. After all, there is an intense rivalry between those two teams.</p>\n<p>Yes, Anthony did win the scoring title this season, narrowly defeating Durant by scoring 28.7 points per game. But James averaged 26.8 points per game while tallying 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists per night. He shot a career-high 56.5 percent from the field, 11.6 percent higher than Anthony.</p>\n<p>James is also known for his defense, while Anthony is not. James earned the second-most votes on this year’s NBA All-Defensive team. He averaged 1.7 steals per game and, of course, is known for his monster blocks tracking down players in transition. He’s not a center, but he makes his opponents think twice.</p>\n<p>And yes, New York did go on a 13-game win streak at the end of the season to secure the second spot in the Eastern Conference, but James led Miami to the second-longest winning streak in NBA history at 27 games to secure the best record in the NBA, tallying 15 double-doubles and two triple-doubles in those 27 games. Plus, during New York’s win streak, they played Miami and did win, but the Heat had benched both Wade and James in order to save them for the postseason.</p>\n<p>Anthony is hands down a great player — there’s no denying that — but the MVP is supposed to go to the player that had the best year and Anthony should not have been in the running. James simply outdid everybody else.</p>\n<p>So to that one voter who voted for Anthony, you took away a great moment from one of the greatest players in the game and voided him of an NBA record he undeniably deserved. Shame on you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51416\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/lebron-james-deserved-a-unanimous-mvp/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51416\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/lebron-james-deserved-a-unanimous-mvp/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/lebron-james-deserved-a-unanimous-mvp/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/lebron-james-deserved-a-unanimous-mvp/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/lebron-james-deserved-a-unanimous-mvp/","id":3208,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3207,3206,3205],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mariano Rivera Proving To Excel Despite Age","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When Yankees manager Joe Girardi is preparing for bed at the end of the night, he makes a phone call to one of his employees to prepare a fine bottle of wine.

It is always the same bottle; it has one taste and only one taste. Yet this taste is the greatest in history, and it has gotten better with age. As you may have guessed, I am not actually talking about wine. I am bringing up the striking comparison between Yankees closer Mariano Rivera and a fine bottle of wine.</p>\n<p>Girardi’s bottle of wine’s unique taste is actually Rivera’s only pitch: his dominating cutter. The bottle of wine’s greatest taste in history refers to the fact that Rivera is the all-time save leader with 624. Rivera has also gotten better with age. After tearing his ACL shagging fly balls in batting practice last season, Rivera is a perfect 16 for 16 in save opportunities this season at the age of 43.</p>\n<p>The Yankees are holding down first place in the AL East despite the injuries to Derek Jeter, Curtis Granderson, Mark Teixeira, and Alex Rodriguez. What is holding them afloat is surely Rivera’s dominance and the resurgence of castoffs like Travis Hafner, Vernon Wells, and Kevin Youkilis. Unfortunately, Rivera announced in March that he will be retiring after this season. Rivera’s retirement, Jeter’s lengthy disabled list stint and the retirement of longtime catcher Jorge Posada mean we are seeing the end of an era in New York.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This season has become Rivera’s farewell tour, just as last year was Chipper Jones’s. Rivera will certainly be on the American League All-Star team this season, but this year’s game might have a twist. There is a movement circulating the baseball world to make Rivera the starting pitcher of this year’s game. We have seen such honorable gestures at the midsummer classic before. You might remember in the 2001 game, Alex Rodriguez moved over to third base to allow Cal Ripken Jr. to return to short stop. Ripken played short stop for most of his career, and Rodriguez’s gesture was a nice touch in Ripken’s final season.</p>\n<p>However, I am against starting Rivera. Pitchers, and especially closers, are creatures of habit. Starting Rivera would most likely affect his performance. It would be a shame to see him struggle on national TV, and it could also affect his mindset when he returns to the Yankees bullpen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/mariano-rivera-proving-to-excel-despite-age/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/mariano-rivera-proving-to-excel-despite-age/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/mariano-rivera-proving-to-excel-despite-age/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/mariano-rivera-proving-to-excel-despite-age/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/mariano-rivera-proving-to-excel-despite-age/","id":3209,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3208,3207,3206],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
