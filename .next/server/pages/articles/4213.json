As for pitching, the UCSB pitching staff has a total 4.76 ERA compared to a 4.89 ERA for that of CSUN.</p>\n<p>These team statistics are of little dominance in the Big West Conference overall, and they are not of great contrast in comparison to one another. However, they highlight that the Gauchos have marginally been pitching, producing fewer errors and creating hits a bit more successfully as a team than the Matadors have and that they generally have not been struggling as much as Northridge has.</p>\n<p>Despite the teams’ struggles, CSUN junior catcher and designated hitter Albee Weiss is leading the Big West in RBIs this season with 25 and teammate Kevin Riley is right behind him with 24.</p>\n<p>Riley, a redshirt junior first-baseman, is also tied for first in Big West in HRs with six total, just above Weiss, who is sitting at a tied second place with five HRs on the year so far. The two sluggers are placed at spots three and four, respectively, on the Matadors’ starting lineup and present a clear threat to the UCSB pitching staff and defense.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, junior outfielder Colton Burns is on the season leaderboard of hitting statistics, with a batting average of .362 to earn him the third spot in the Big West. But other than Burns, no other Gauchos are individually leading the conference at the plate. In fact, no other Gaucho hitter that has started every game is currently hitting above the .300 mark.</p>\n<p>As teams, neither UCSB nor CSUN evidently has a command over the other, making this series a fairly even matchup. However, they each have strong and talented individuals who assuredly have the potential to execute on any opportunities that come their way to produce a spark for success. Moreover, baseball is a game that has the tendency to defy any sort of expected outcomes one might provide, as most fans know.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, in particular, it definitely needs a change of pace if it wants to salvage what has been a rough start to the season. Advantageous to the Matadors, the Gauchos have a shaky 2-9 record when away from home, so they will certainly need to determine a way to gain more of an edge without their optimal home-field support.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on CSUN in a three-game series beginning at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 7th at Matador field with Saturday and Sunday’s games kicking off at 1 p.m. at the same location.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76646\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-hopes-to-end-3-game-skid-in-away-series-at-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76646\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-hopes-to-end-3-game-skid-in-away-series-at-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-hopes-to-end-3-game-skid-in-away-series-at-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-hopes-to-end-3-game-skid-in-away-series-at-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-hopes-to-end-3-game-skid-in-away-series-at-csun/","id":4210,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4209,4208,4207],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Shows Support of Voting Rights for Non-Citizens in I.V.","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-16-at-11.26.19-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-16-at-11.26.19-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On Wednesday, UCSB's A.S.

Students live in I.V. for four to five years; they deserve to have their voices heard,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>The resolution writes that non-citizen resident status includes “visa holders, permanent residents, undocumented, and mixed status.”</p>\n<p>The Senate will only support these efforts if residents’ personal information and voting data will not be accessible to third parties such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (I.C.E.), and if any movements to extend voting rights to non-citizens does not negatively impact UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Residents of I.V. pay property taxes which fund local agencies including the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD), the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and local school districts, but only citizens can elect board members to these organizations.</p>\n<p>The issue of voting rights for non-citizens is personal for Cornejo.</p>\n<p>“As students and residents here we pay taxes … For some, you do have a vote on who you elect, for others, myself for instance, I do not,” Cornejo told the Senate during Wednesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Measure R was cited as a reason for passing the resolution. Because non-citizens could not vote for this measure, which raised taxes for I.V. residents, “many students and UCSB community members [are] disenfranchised regarding their tax dollars,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>During discussion of the resolution, Cornejo cited the San Francisco Unified School District as an example of granting non-citizens the right to vote in District elections. In November 2016, San Francisco voters passed Proposition N, which extended voting rights in school district elections to non-citizens who are of legal voting age and are a parent or legal guardian of a child under 19 living in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are no resolutions to extend voting rights to non-citizens in I.V., and the path to extend non-citizens the right to vote is more complex than other cities because I.V. is unincorporated territory.</p>\n<p>According to Cornejo, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors would have to vote to declare I.V. incorporated territory. If I.V. was an incorporated territory, town representatives could add a resolution into I.V.’s bylaws granting non-citizens voting rights in local elections.</p>\n<p>As of 7 p.m. on Wednesday, I.V. CSD President Spencer Brandt said he was not aware of the resolution and said he would have to consult I.V. CSD’s legal counsel before he could give a firm answer about what governing body would have the power to grant non-citizens local voting rights.</p>\n<p>“But in general, I support allowing undocumented people to vote in local elections. If you live here and pay taxes here, you should be able to participate in local decision making,” Brandt added in a statement to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Katherine Swartz is a staff writer at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Le dan mucho gusto. Llegan y me saludan,”” Camacho said in an interview with the Nexus. “Creo que va hacer un éxito.”</p>\n<p>“All the young people of the university are very happy. They like [the truck] a lot. They come and they greet me,” Camacho said. “I believe it will be a success.”</p>\n<p>UCSB prohibited Camacho from <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/\">selling food on campus in 2017</a> due to violations with its Environmental Health and Safety policies for off-campus food vendors.</p>\n<p>Camacho then began collecting funds to transfer his business from the small blue cart he used on campus to a new food truck. He used money from his savings in addition to a loan to bring the project to life.</p>\n<p>“Empezó el proyecto cuando desde el momento que nos sacaron de la universidad,” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>“The project started from the moment they took us out from the university,” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>Camacho previously sold food on campus in collaboration with student organizations from UCSB for fundraising events when the Office of Student Life still gave permits to vendors like Camacho to sell on campus.</p>\n<p>Some of the student organizations that Camacho worked with tried to raise money for Camacho after he was banned from selling on campus. Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educación y Revolución (M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB) created a GoFundMe page to fundraise money for Camacho’s new food truck.</p>\n<p>GoFundMe later refunded the money because M.U.J.E.R. was unaware of the time limit policy on fundraisers, according to M.U.J.E.R. former co-chair Dulce Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>The inside of the truck has a built-in kitchen with a freezer, an ice machine and three sinks for Camacho to prepare his products.</p>\n<p>Currently, Camacho sells food in Isla Vista, Goleta, Carpinteria and Santa Barbara. He hopes to expand his service by obtaining additional permits so he can sell his treats in Lompoc, Santa Maria, Paso Robles and other nearby places.</p>\n<p>Camacho likes to frequent the parking lot across the street from Wells Fargo, where other I.V. food trucks set up shop as well, to access students leaving or entering the university through the Pardall Tunnel.</p>\n<p>In addition to the usual food Camacho sells, he now offers paletas, a Mexican frozen ice pop that usually comes in flavors like mango or strawberry.</p>\n<p>Despite his success with the launch of the food truck, Camacho still hopes to be able to sell on campus again. He is working on obtaining the proper permits from the university to return to selling on campus in addition to off campus with the food truck.</p>\n<p>Camacho said that in the end, having the truck would help him help students.</p>\n<p>“He querido ayudar los grupos de la universidad, que todo los grupos tienen una mayor necesidad, que todos tenemos una mayor necesidad de como pagar renta de pagar comida,” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>“Esa fue la idea que me hizo a mi hacer la troca, para seguir ayudando hacer los eventos.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve wanted to help the groups of the university, all the groups that have a major necessity, like how to pay the rent or pay for food. ” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>“That was the idea which made me do the truck, to continue helping put on the events.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Jan. 25, 12:30 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Hijinio was not aware of what happened to the money raised for him through GoFundMe.
