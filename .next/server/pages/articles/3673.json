This includes a tenant or family member being sick with coronavirus, a tenant being laid off or losing hours or a tenant having to miss work to look after their child. In Santa Barbara County, all K-12 schools are closed as a result of coronavirus, the </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/03/13/santa-barbara-county-k-12-schools-closing-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, similar to other counties across the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid eviction, the tenant must provide their landlord with documentation that shows their inability to pay rent, such as an employment termination notice or a bank statement, according to the executive order. Additionally, the tenant must notify their landlord in writing that they are unable to pay rent at least seven days prior to rent being due.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No tenants are exempt from paying their rent entirely, however; the executive order only stops evictions. Tenants must pay all the rent they missed after the May 31 deadline or they will then face eviction, according to the statewide order.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County eviction moratorium shares the May 31 deadline and also stipulates that the ordinance only protects against eviction and does not excuse any tenants from paying rent back at a later time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People who can pay rent should pay rent, but we cannot allow people to get evicted at a time </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when it will spread the sickness and endanger us all,” 1st District Supervisor Das Williams said in a press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams, who authored the ordinance alongside 2nd District Supervisor Gregg Hart, said during the meeting that the ordinance is a necessary step to prevent the rise of houselessness and the spread of coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If there were a large number of evictions, we would either have more people congregating as homeless, or more people congregating in the homes of friends and family,” Williams said. “That is not a good thing for limiting the spread of coronavirus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ordinance has legal limitations as to who is and who is not protected by the moratorium, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">County Counsel Michael C. Ghizzoni, who spoke at the supervisors meeting about the legal implication of the ordinance, said</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, tenants must notify their landlords that they have been economically impacted specifically by the coronavirus pandemic, not for any other reasons. Additionally, the ordinance does “not prohibit</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the landlord pursuing a payment of rent through any of the other causes of action that they have,” Ghizzoni said, meaning that the supervisors are only restricting landlords from evicting tenants, not from other warning actions against tenants not paying rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many community members showed support for the moratorium over the phone and through email, but some worried about the burden of tenants having to pay back missed rent after the protections expire in June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Appelbaum, a UCSB professor emeritus in the global studies department, voiced his concern in an email to the Board of Supervisors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realize that landlords need to be made whole once this passes; but tenants who were unemployed will have lost the income that would otherwise be used for the missed rental payments,” Appelbaum wrote. “Somehow, they should be protected.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Supervisors does not have the authority to provide financial support to people who have lost jobs, 5th District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino said. Residents should instead count on the national government for unemployment help, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that’s a little over our pay-grade at the county level, but keep your eyes on that federal stimulus package,” Lavagnino said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ordinance only protects unincorporated areas of the county, but individual cities within Santa Barbara County have already taken action to prevent evictions during the pandemic, including Goleta, Santa Barbara and Ojai. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because I.V. is unincorporated territory in Santa Barbara County, any protections for I.V. residents must come from the countywide level.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Yang sent out an email Tuesday afternoon notifying students about the case in Isla Vista, adding that the case was “a previously confirmed case of COVID-19 [which] was found to be located within the boundaries of the Isla Vista community” after the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department began using GIS mapping to identify confirmed cases.</p>\n<p>“<strong>We have no indication that this case involves anyone affiliated with UC Santa Barbara</strong>, but given the proximity of Isla Vista to campus, the number of our students who live in Isla Vista, and our faculty and staff who live in Isla Vista or adjacent communities, we wanted to notify our campus community of this development,” Yang wrote.</p>\n<p>Yang also added that two people affiliated with UCSB who live together tested positive for coronavirus after one returned from Europe on March 13.</p>\n<p>“<strong>Both individuals have not been on campus and have been in self-quarantine since March 13.</strong> They currently remain in self-quarantine off campus and are recovering,” Yang wrote.</p>\n<p>At the Monday afternoon press conference, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henning Ansorg, the Santa Barbara Public Health Department public health officer, said the rise in cases in Santa Barbara County had been expected by the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The increase in numbers is very typical for a virus that spreads quickly from person to person. We expected a doubling of cases within three days and that is almost exactly what we have seen,” Ansorg said. “It is an indicator of just how infectious this thing is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to slow the continued rise of cases and mitigate the spread of the virus, Ansorg also emphasized the necessity of social distancing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only definitive factor which makes a substantial difference between the best and worst case scenario is how much community members stay physically isolated from each other. Continuing with our current efforts of social distancing will make all the difference,” Ansorg said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Ansorg did not specifically mention the I.V. case during the conference, it was announced about two hours later through the Santa Barbara Public Health Department </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBCPublicHealth/status/1244799094272471042\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter account.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the confirmation of an I.V. coronavirus case, the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) issued a state of emergency in I.V. at its March 24 virtual meeting, strongly urging the county to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to take all necessary actions to slow the spread of COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now that we have a case of COVID-19 in Isla Vista, it is time for Isla Vistans to take social distancing seriously. This is a public health crisis that will affect not just our older folks — it will affect student-aged individuals too,” I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said in an interview on Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In accordance with federal, state and local mandates ordering social distancing and banning gatherings of more than 10 people, the district also urged Isla Vistans at its meeting to avoid any mass gatherings, including Deltopia — the yearly unsanctioned street party held on the first weekend of spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V.

handguns who were spotted leaving the 65 block of Sabado in Isla Vista after committing an armed robbery at approximately 10:23 a.m., according to an alert sent out Monday morning by UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At approximately 12:20 p.m., Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson Raquel Zick confirmed there have been no further sightings of the suspects since the initial one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three adult suspects — a white man armed with a handgun wearing a ski mask and all black, another white man armed with a handgun wearing no ski mask and camouflage and a black man who was not carrying a gun — broke into 6571 Sabado Tarde just before 10:22 a.m. this morning, Zick said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two victims were inside the apartment at the time — the suspects took two laptops, one phone, one wallet and cannabis, Zick told the Nexus.

Theater once class ended at 11:50 a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When another reporter attempted to enter the University Center, the doors were being locked and students were being advised to stay indoors.
