No, I’m not talking about getting your books, stop that. Do you know me at all? No, it’s Christmas season round 2: winter sports.</p>\n<p>See, the first time I heard the term “jersey chaser” I responded with, “I chase my alcohol with whiskey,” but when I realized it wasn’t THAT kind of chaser (don’t get me wrong, I don’t run either), I was far more willing to give it the old, ahem, college try.</p>\n<p>Let’s get one thing straight here, those guys carrying around those blue backpacks? Pussy. Magnets. And trust me, I don’t use that term loosely. Here’s the problem though, every single guy who carries one of those knows that. So girls, you have to prepare yourselves. If the captain from the lacrosse team comes up to you, don’t choke and tell him something stupid like, “I’m really good at one-liners.” Because then you’ll be forced to take your shirt off as redemption, and maybe that might make you seem as though you’re coming on too strongly. Well, I take that back. I think it depends on the size of your rack.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Anyway, you’re lucky because in high school I was bored enough to play sports team bingo. I learned the ins, the outs and what they actually talk about in the locker room. When people on the team suddenly know your name, don’t get flattered and think you’re a keeper. No, that just means that stories about you have bounced around that room faster than your pretty little head did last Friday night.</p>\n<p>Men with sticks have bigger dicks. Well, that, or they’re flaming douchebags. Okay, that wasn’t cute and didn’t rhyme, but it’s true. So before you run off to become the next puck slut or lacrosstitute, know what you’re getting into. You have to go to the games. You have to. You’re an unpaid, improperly clothed cheerleader. But don’t be too dumb about the rules of the game you’re attending. If you can’t figure out that virtually every sport requires getting the ball from one end to the other, good luck scoring elsewhere.</p>\n<p>But let’s be real, you have to rely on your friends sometimes. What if you “accidentally get a flat tire” on the way to meeting them at the game? You come in all frazzled like a damsel in distress, breathlessly ask, “What did I miss?” And suddenly, it’s as if you’d been there all along!</p>\n<p>Hooking up with an athlete isn’t brain science, though. Don’t get me wrong here. But holding onto one is damn well near impossible. So don’t blow it by asking him immediately what his jersey number is or what it stands for. Most of the time, it’s a good thing. But there are those rare cases where it means something way too sentimental to ask mid-“teach me how to dougie” at their “we just lost but already planned this party” after-party. Save the question for a post-nookie cig-break.</p>\n<p>Another deal breaker? Actually stealing the jersey. Turns out they kind of need those, and when you’ve tacked it to your wall, it can be a little awkward when they bust in your door 20 minutes til game time to demount the jersey … and permanently demount you. (But by all means, start a victory T-shirt collection).</p>\n<p>Also, I have no idea what is going on once they step onto that field, but seriously every single guy steps off broken in at least seven different places, even if all they did was run a few laps during warm-up. So if you get all riled up in bed, ease up on the dominatrix, Kama-sutra bullshit. Even if you think he’s being overdramatic about his hurt shoulder, his teammates are convinced it’s your fault and that their season has immediately gone to shit, and bottom line: they will hunt you down. I’m telling you, that locker room is only used for power play planning and pure fucking evil.</p>\n<p>Being a jersey chaser is like being on The Bachelor. Every girl around you is going for the same guy. So practice some self-control. Or, just go for his friend. But, regardless, remember to get onboard with the mindset of: “Yeah! You could totally make a living out of this! Who needs school?” Start by stroking his ego, and you’ll end up, stroking … well … other things.</p>\n<p>Now, go make yourself useful and print out the schedule, roster and bios of all of the winter sports teams. A good jersey chaser knows her shit. And hey, number 7 on the club baseball team? Nice ass.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks encourages you to take one for the team. Double teamed? Double points.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Andrea Napoli” align=”aligncenter” width=”193″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hump-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1496490971\" data-slb-group=\"43587\"><img data-attachment-id=\"43588\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/dont-chase-shots-chase-jerseys-land/hump-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hump-1.jpg?fit=361%2C466&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"361,466\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Game on\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hump-1.jpg?fit=194%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hump-1.jpg?fit=361%2C466&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-43588\" title=\"Game on\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hump-1-193x250.jpg?resize=193%2C250\" alt=\"\" width=\"193\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/dont-chase-shots-chase-jerseys-land/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/dont-chase-shots-chase-jerseys-land/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/dont-chase-shots-chase-jerseys-land/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/dont-chase-shots-chase-jerseys-land/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/dont-chase-shots-chase-jerseys-land/","id":6428,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6427,6426,6425],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks","biography":"Not available","articles":[6391,6392,6415,6417,6418,6420,6421,6422,6425,6426,6427,6428,6429],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"“I’m Not a Slut, I Swear” and Other Bedroom Mantras","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Shit Girls Say” started an epidemic.

I just watched “Shit People Say About Shit People Say Videos” for a solid minute and 39 seconds; yeah, it’s gotten to that point. But you know what they don’t have? A “Shit Guys and Girls Say During or After Hookups That Just Really, Really Should Not Be Happening.” These are a few that need to stop:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1. The Unprovoked “What?”: God, classic. You’re sprawled out in bed, it’s 7 a.m. and the I.V. construction workers can blatantly see you in the buff through the window. He checks his watch, because, yes, he kept it on throughout the sex. The girl is awake first, as she always is, and just pretending to be asleep (fact). And then, shoot, you’re both awake and you both know it and no one’s talking … so, out of nowhere, the girl looks over and says “Whaaaat?” and the guy all of a sudden remembers why he doesn’t ever want a girlfriend, ever, and responds with, “Nothing.” Nothing, bitch. Nothing. You need to chill out. Nothing. The “what” is a recurring issue. Just stop asking, because, really, has it ever worked? Never has he turned and said, “Actually, you know, I have just been waiting for someone to ask me that. This is what is going on in my hea- Wait! Actually, can I just like have your number to chat? Just to cuddle for half an hour and then walk you home while concealing my boner?”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>2. The Dirty Talk That Haunts You: Sometimes when you’re in bed (read: every time) someone says something that seems so perfectly fitting, but actually isn’t. And then you’re sitting in your 8 a.m. three days later and all of a sudden it creeps back into your head. You’re taking a test, trying to remember the answer to number 3 and all you can hear is, “Swallow that pimp juice” in that bedroom whisper, and you want to crawl into a hole and die. Like, what the fuck is the answer to number 3? That’s all I wanted to know.</p>\n<p>3. The “I’m not a slut, I swear” Line: That awkward moment when both parties are completely naked and condom wrappers are coming off and all of a sudden it turns into a Dr. Phil session. There is no need to get into “what’s your number” talks, but for some reason girls seem to jump at the opportunity to save face before showing a guy their O-face. He probably didn’t think she was a slut when he brought her home, and even if he did, it clearly has not fazed him at all. But now the horrible buzz-kill moment of having to stop to put on a condom has turned into a 35-second segue into, “So listen, these are my morals.” Don’t worry about it. Either stop counting or stop sleeping around. Or call your sluttier friends — they always make you feel better. And even if you run out of fingers … or toes … numbers will always stretch to infinity.</p>\n<p>4. The “No, no, you’re fine, let me push your head down farther” Move: Do you ever eat bananas? And by eat, I mean swallow them entirely whole. If you do, then congratulations! You don’t have a gag reflex! But for those of us that do, it’s really, really not a good time, when you’re coming up for air, for the guy to push your head down farther because you’re “almost there.” (Note: Your definition of “almost” is not the same as ours.) And then there’s the most horrifying moment of all: the run to the bathroom (fingers crossed you even make it) and proj-vom. No one wants that. Just lean back, yo.

It’s a fact. You know when you hook up again and all of a sudden it’s like they fucked the swag back into you? It can start off as innocently as trying to make a subpar Thursday night into something better because, “Oh my God my town blooooows,” when, shit; did all the stars just align?</p>\n<p>Really, it’s too easy. The “game” is over, because back when everyone was either playing hard to get or actually was hard to get in high school, our boundaries have slowly been tarnished and/or drowned by cheap vodka as the years in college have gone by. It’s always fun to see the “honors to hooters” kind of girls. You know the ones: brilliant and nerdy in high school, and now casually answer to “slut bag Mcfuck stick.”</p>\n<p>The freshmen are the most fun to watch return. After only two months of experiencing life without parental controls on the TV remote they suddenly have “do me” written across their foreheads. I commend the freshmen who are still dating their lovers from high school and doing the long distance thing, but c’mon; what’s the over/under bet on them breaking up by Jan. 16? Who’s with me?</p>\n<p>Sex with an ex is real-life recycling. Plus, it’s always fun to see what other people are really learning in college. Personally, I think it makes for the best pillow talk. The only way to assure that you are keeping it casual and not falling into the high school sweethearts trap is to swap sexcapade stories. You already know all the boring shit about this person so you might as well make it interesting.</p>\n<p>I don’t know what it is — maybe it’s the fact that you already know the person so well — but the best one-liners come from sex-with-an-ex scenarios. My personal favorite? Being told that getting jizzed on is a necessary evil. And the fact that it can all be played off as being totally normal. Four weeks, ending with coming into the New Year with a bang (see what I did there?), leaves room for weird behavior.</p>\n<p>Speaking of weird behavior, try to avoid telling your ex that they peaked in high school — even if it’s true. And that stupid tattoo that they got in an attempt to be a badass? Just go with it. The holidays are also all about acceptance. Keep your mouth shut, at the very least until the deed is done … it’s what Jesus would do.</p>\n<p>There is a chance that you may regain consciousness and discover that your ex still sucks. Life may not be a personality contest, but high school sure as hell was. And if they’re still stuck in high school, back away slowly. If his pick up line is, “Let me put my ear phone in your iPod,” the night probably isn’t going to be magical. And if they’re still using pick up lines, sweetly advise them to re-evaluate their life.</p>\n<p>But, for your own sake, I hope that it all goes well. And I hope that you come back from break with that extra bounce in your step.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks has hos in different area codes.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/exercise-logic-work-hard-easy-booty/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43221\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/exercise-logic-work-hard-easy-booty/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/exercise-logic-work-hard-easy-booty/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/exercise-logic-work-hard-easy-booty/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/exercise-logic-work-hard-easy-booty/","id":6426,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6425,6424,6423],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Home Is Where the Heart Is, Not to Mention the Hassle-Free Lay","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"So now that you’ve gotten through the holidays, and hopefully entered into the New Year with a bang (hey, you deserve it!), it’s back to reality.

The last time I checked it was the 12 days of Christmas, not the 12 days of blowies, but hey, we all have our own interpretation of the holiday spirit.</p>\n<p>Or having a random-ass kid you haven’t seen since the early ’90s approach you completely blacked out and instantly assume that you haven’t changed from your fifth-grade self. Mid-shot someone just threw out, “Wow! I thought that you were still practicing abstinence!” The last time we spoke, I was 10, but wishful thinking, kid.</p>\n<p>I would much rather have all of these people safely hidden away on Facebook where they belong, because there are very few things that I appreciate in 3-D. Titanic is probably both the beginning and the ending of that list. (Leo, you’re my homeboy.) So the walking yearbook that my town turned into was no fucking tea party. Actually, if I ever signed any yearbooks at all, I think the extent of it was “HAGS.” Going for the “just-DGAF-enough-to-be-legendary” approach, I guess. Well, okay, I apologize, but high school isn’t really anyone’s prime. And if it was, I’m sorry. Personally, I wouldn’t say I was an alcoholic. I’d say that I was getting a head start. My most notably sloppy behavior happened roughly five or six years ago, and now I finally got my revenge as I watched all the self-proclaimed frat stars and sowhorities get shitfaced off apple pie shots and debatable cranberry vodkas that tasted suspiciously like a Shirley Temple. So many sloppy truths, so little time.</p>\n<p>Speaking of sloppy truths, seeing people face to face I found out real quick who sharpened their Photoshop skills since college began. Oh, so you did gain 20 pounds and still look like a horse. Got it. According to your amateur modeling pictures you post every minute on the minute, I was beginning to think there was going to be some new competition at the bar. Guess not.</p>\n<p>Other than gallivanting around openly tweeting each other (@ms_e_brooks) and passing around Facebook prof pics of the highlights of who you fucked so far in college, I quite enjoyed making inappropriate Christmas puns to the people I never liked in high school. “Fancy seeing you here! Oh it is the most wonderful time of the year!” Until I realized Justin Bieber has a Christmas album out and I was inadvertently quoting him.</p>\n<p>But who are we kidding? Rekindling the old flames is where all the fun really lies. Because let’s face it, no one gives a shit any more. And there’s that whole convenience thing. No more stupid one-liners just to get the girl in your room, like, “Hey wanna see the fish in my room?” People love looking at fish when they’re drunk. It’s a proven fact. Mostly though, you can say whatever the fuck you want because you know exactly when you’ll be leaving. It’s a deadline kind of relationship. I dig it.</p>\n<p>Just think of all the possibilities to be incredibly blunt and obnoxious. As he’s coming throw out a “Whew. Let. It. Snow. You tiger, you.” Or instead of gracefully sneaking out and making your exit, or allowing the bangee to abruptly leave, why not battle who gets to leave first? Throw out a real quick, “Listen, bang and bolt is MY job, don’t steal my thunder, bitch.” What’s fair is fair, and you both know you’re still gonna fuck again tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Going back home gives you the opportunity to redeem blue-balling that kid in high school, or finally getting with that high school sensation (even though he/she probably sucks now … but whatever, moral victory). And when you go to the local bar where everyone knows your name (and all of your dumb mistakes) whether you like it or not, just take comfort in the fact that nothing ever changes.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/home-heart-mention-hasslefree-lay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/home-heart-mention-hasslefree-lay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/home-heart-mention-hasslefree-lay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/home-heart-mention-hasslefree-lay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/home-heart-mention-hasslefree-lay/","id":6427,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6426,6425,6424],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
