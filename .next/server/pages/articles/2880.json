Grewal’s in-depth research about American Muslims discusses whether Islam can be seen as an American religion in the same way that other religions are accepted.</p>\n<p>According to Grewal, there is a common sentiment in the U.S. that assumes Islam contradicts widely-held American values.</p>\n<p>“There is something specific about Islam that for many people makes [them] understand it as kind of the exact antithesis of American values,” Grewal said.</p>\n<p>Quoting Malcolm X’s speech “The Ballot or the Bullet,” Grewal delineated the difference between legal citizenship and social citizenship to convey that American Muslims are still dealing with issues that existed in the 1960’s.</p>\n<p>“I hope what you’ll see when you hear this quote is how much it is still relevant today, the kinds of things he is posing,” Grewal said. “He says … ‘Being here in America doesn’t make you an American. Being born here in America doesn’t make you an American. Why if birth made you an American, you wouldn’t need any legislation; you wouldn’t need any amendments to the Constitution.’”</p>\n<p>According to Grewal, American media has created an obstacle for American Muslims by primarily focusing on of terrorism when any discussion on Islam arises. According to Grewal, this has dramatically changed the way in which American Muslims speak to one another regarding the debate on the reform of Islam.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61301\" style=\"width: 257px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61301\" data-attachment-id=\"61301\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/professor-talks-about-muslims-in-the-us/zareena-grewal-speaks-to-a-full-crowd-at-the-mcc-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.2\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424774127\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"105\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Reform of Islam/Muslims\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61301\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=247%2C164\" alt=\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.

the ways in which these debates about the reform of Islam are constrained by the media lens and what’s interesting, I think, is that even when the cameras are off and there’s no recorders and no microphones are turned on, what you find now is that American Muslims are conditioned now,” Grewal said. “So the way they speak to each other, even when no one else is there is so profoundly transformed.”</p>\n<p>Grewal said the change in behavior by American Muslims has impeded conversation regarding the reform of Islam.</p>\n<p>“If they are anyone who is actually invested in the reform of Islam, that conversation can’t happen if nobody even feels safe to say what they really think,” Grewal said.</p>\n<p>Commission on Jewish Muslim Unity member Joyce Herman said the discussion helped her further her understanding of the struggles American Muslims face, especially regarding the American media’s portrayal of Islam.</p>\n<p>“It helps me to see more of their internal struggles … to see the ways in which American Muslims are both stereotyped and … that the media have these expectations that they’re going to be the ones that solve the terrorism,” Herman said.</p>\n<p>Alumna Noora Kamel said she enjoyed the discussion because Grewal addressed American Muslim attitudes on the critical challenges facing Islam today.</p>\n<p>“Professor Grewal really captures … the sentiments of the American Muslim community,” Kamel said. “I really appreciated how she was able to frame American Muslim issues from the perspective of the American Muslim community as opposed to just bringing in how the media tends to portray Muslims.”</p>\n<p>Kamel also said she valued Grewal’s ability to challenge the way American media has portrayed Islam since the beginning of the War On Terror.</p>\n<p>“The media tends to take fringe voices or small groups and kind of depict them as being the voice of the majority,” Kamel said. “I like that she kind of complicated that image … showing the nuances within the American Muslim community.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Pakistan Marc Grossman visited campus this past Friday to speak to students at the global studies department about his 30-year career with the U.S. Foreign Service.</p>\n<p>As a former diplomat and government official, Grossman also worked as the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, which is the State Department’s third ranking official. As Under Secretary, Grossman assembled diplomatic support for the U.S. after the September 11 attacks, and as U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan he supported the Afghan peace process and worked to improve U.S.-Pakistan relations.</p>\n<p>Grossman, who was born in Los Angeles, received a degree in political science from UCSB, and said one of his professors saw his potential after two years at the university.</p>\n<p>“He arranged for me to go on the Education Abroad Program,” Grossman said. “I’d never left the state of California before, and hours later we landed in London.”</p>\n<p>Grossman then got his master’s degree in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science before returning to Santa Barbara. Grossman said after returning and working in Santa Barbara for several years, he sought a career that would cater to his passion.</p>\n<p>“I came back to Santa Barbara, where I worked for three years — a year in politics and a couple years selling things door to door, which turned out to be great experience,” Grossman said. “One day I said to myself, I have got to find a profession that is going to pay me to live abroad and be curious about how other people live.”</p>\n<p>According to Grossman, he passed the Foreign Service exam at UCSB, then the oral exam at the Federal Building in Los Angeles, and in March of 1976 joined the Foreign Service and moved to the East Coast.</p>\n<p>Grossman said one of his biggest accomplishments during his time in the Foreign Service was working to dissuade the Turkish government from using torture when handling prisoners.</p>\n<p>“We were able to convince Turks that this kind of abuse — the systematic abuse of people — was just wrong,” Grossman said.</p>\n<p>According to Grossman, diplomacy is always changing, and he is excited to see college students majoring in fields like global studies and considering international careers.</p>\n<p>“The world is changing so fast, and these interactions are changing so fast,” Grossman said. “I teach to a lot of brand new American diplomats, and I envy them. They are really going to lead our engagement in the world for a very long time to come.”</p>\n<p>Grossman said students today are lucky to have more opportunities in the international field than he had when he started his career.</p>\n<p>“If you wanted to live that kind of life, diplomacy was basically the only way to do it,” Grossman said. “The choices that you all now have with non-governmental organizations, with charities, with multilateral organizations, with businesses, with more ways that people are today employed abroad, are very exciting prospects.”</p>\n<p>Grossman also said he hopes some students will consider a career in diplomacy for the United States.</p>\n<p>“I hope you really will consider representing the United States,” Grossman said. “There’s no substitute for working in an office where you have the American flag flying.”</p>\n<p>Global Studies Professor Eve Darian-Smith said Grossman gave students insight into a career path many global studies students are considering to pursue.</p>\n<p>“The visit from former Ambassador Marc Grossman was very exciting and granted our Global Studies students a glimpse into the life of a leading diplomat working at the frontlines of U.S. foreign policy in extremely difficult political contexts,” Darian-Smith said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and psychology double major Edixon Puglisi said it is important that those who are “experts of their craft” convey their experiences to students.</p>\n<p>“It is very important to pass down to new generations the keys to success in each field of study, as well as the experiences of success and failure in each field, in such a way so that we may learn from our mistakes and become more efficient and effective individuals in society,” Puglisi said.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Harrison Marshall said listening Grossman’s talk actually helped him finalize his decision to apply to work for the U.S.</p>\n<p>“For me personally it gave me a lot of perspective on what I want to be pursuing with my life,” Marshall said. “Because of the visit I’m most definitely going to be applying for the State, which is something I had only considered before.”</p>\n<p>According to Darian-Smith, the Q&amp;A session following Grossman’s talk gave many students insight into the nuances of a career in foreign diplomacy.</p>\n<p>“It was a unique opportunity for students to ask the Ambassador direct questions, which he answered with candor, grace and humor,” Darian-Smith said. “Students’ minds were opened up to the contradictions and unpredictability of navigating foreign relations across different cultures, religions and worldviews, and the visit provided an invaluable ‘real-life’ teaching moment.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Hosted by A.S. President Ali Guthy and A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau, the forum informed students about and addressed questions regarding the proposed plan.</p>\n<p>According to Lau, students who currently receive financial aid are allocated around $2,600 to cover health insurance costs no matter whether or not they waive GHI, which is the reason behind the financial office’s plan to reduce aid.</p>\n<p>“Currently, students who have a certain need level all get financial aid for GHI at $2,600. Even though your expenses are less, even if you waive out, you still get that much if you’re the same need level as someone who still participates in Gaucho Health Insurance,” Lau said. “That was the concern that the financial aid office had and that’s why they proposed this new financial aid package.”</p>\n<p>Lau said the financial aid office is apprehensive that students will purposely select inadequate health insurances costing significantly less than $2,600 instead of GHI to have excess financial aid money for other non-health purposes.</p>\n<p>“Their main concern was that people were getting so much money, this $2,600 for health insurance, but on average outside of UCSB the amount that you have to pay for health insurance is a lot less than that,” Lau said. “Let’s say its $1,500, so now students have an extra $1,000 so to them, it seemed like the $1,000 was enough to entice someone to essentially get a crap health insurance and they didn’t like that.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, students may still require the excess money to pay for necessities such as rent or food. The financial aid office contends the excess money should be used to provide aid to new students, or to students who previously applied unsuccessfully for aid due to the lack of funds.</p>\n<p>“From our perspective, we were saying that while students are using that extra $1,000 for housing, or for textbooks, or for food, they still need that money,” Guthy said. “But the financial aid office’s argument is that well if we take that $1,000 back, so instead of giving you the $2,600 when your health insurance only costs $1,500 we take $1,000 away, we can spend that money to allocate more financial aid to more students.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said aid money is still necessary to cover additional healthcare costs for those without GHI.</p>\n<p>“I would say that even if you are on your parents’ plan that doesn’t mean you don’t have healthcare costs,” Mancini said. “What if you’re on your parents plan and you have to go to the hospital for some reason or you’re on an expensive drug? You’re still paying for healthcare you’re still paying for the price of those drugs or the price of that pay in some way or another.”<br>\nAccording to Guthy, health insurance is required for all students, and the financial aid office’s original proposal would not provide any financial aid money for health insurance unless it is GHI.</p>\n<p>“It’s essentially saying, ‘You can either have this health insurance or we’re not going to pay for anything else,’” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Lau said the initial plan would create a health insurance monopoly where students receiving financial aid are essentially forced to choose GHI.</p>\n<p>“It almost seemed like they were monopolizing the health insurance market for all students saying, ‘You have to have GHI to get financial aid for it,’” Lau said.</p>\n<p>A.S. met with the financial aid office for a revised plan, which will involve surveying students to determine a health insurance industry average that students will be given if they choose to waive GHI, instead of the original proposal which would not allocate any money for health costs, according to Guthy.</p>\n<p>“We came up with a preliminary agreement that the financial aid office would pay an industry standard to students who waive out of Gaucho Health Insurance,” Guthy said. “They’re planning to conduct a survey to all students who opt out of Gaucho Health Insurance to see kind of what kinds they have to define what this industry standard is.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said students who choose an insurance plan above the surveyed industry standard can still receive financial aid to cover the difference.</p>\n<p>“If your health insurance happens to be greater than the industry average but below Gaucho Health Insurance you can still go into the financial aid office and get a grant to cover your health insurance,” Guthy said, “All you need to do is come in with a bill and they’ll pay for it.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the financial aid office established the proposal to allocate money more efficiently so that students receive the precise monetary amount they require and no more.</p>\n<p>“The kind of motivation behind this is to make the spending of financial aid more efficient,” Guthy said. “They want you to spend the money to the exact level that you need, they don’t want you to have excess. And they’re arguing if we give you more money for health insurance than you need, that’s excess and we don’t want you to have excess.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Alex Hill said the financial aid office allocates a certain amount of financial aid specifically for health purposes, and any excess portion of that amount not being used for health is deemed wasteful by the financial aid office.</p>\n<p>“You have a lot of students who are either shopping on the market and getting a cheaper plan, or are on their parents plan and ultimately their costs are reduced. Students are having say between $500 and $1,000 per year extra money that is not going to health costs,” Hill said. “According to the financial aid office, based off their breakdown, technically we’re wasting money, so we need to adjust our standards so it’s more strict.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

policies for deadlines for the March 2 filing of 2015–16 financial aid applications.</p>\n<p>The policy shift comes as part of an effort by the financial aid office to ensure equitable distribution of university funding to students who file their applications on time and to increase the amount of students who file in a timely manner. The shift applies to students applying for university funding using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and CA DREAM Act funding, due March 2. The restrictions on FAFSA filing does not apply to certain funding sources such as Federal Pell grants and scholarships, and is strictly limited to institutional financial aid provided by the university.</p>\n<p>Students who miss the filing date are allowed to make an appeal via the existing appeals process for “on-time status,” which would allow them to be considered for full university funding despite missing the deadline. Additionally, the financial aid office will also be strictly enforcing a June 15 deadline to submit financial aid related documents, such as W-2 tax forms.</p>\n<p>Financial aid office director Mike Miller said while the university has always had priority deadlines for students, they have not been strictly enforced until now.</p>\n<p>“In the past we’ve created a culture of kind of procrastination and there weren’t any penalties for students who didn’t meet the deadlines,” Miller said. “Over the years it’s become a significant issue workload-wise, but also in terms of funding availability.”</p>\n<p>Miller also said stricter deadlines should ensure students do not miss out on funding because university funding is limited and there is significant possibility for the funding to simply run out in part because of an increase in student need for financial aid.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, when our university grant funds run out, which has been happening over the last couple of years because we have more needy students on campus … even if somebody submits an appeal for on time status, if we don’t have the funding then we can’t fund them,” Miller said, “So it’s really important that students get their applications in on time.”</p>\n<p>Miller said while appeals are still an option for late filers, appeals will be granted on a case by case basis for extreme circumstances.</p>\n<p>“We’ll take a look at all the appeals that we get and if there are extreme circumstances then we’ll look at those on a case by case basis,” Miller said. “But if a student misses the deadline and simply sends us an appeal that says that they weren’t aware that they needed verification documents because they didn’t read their email, then those are situations that will likely be denied moving forward.”</p>\n<p>According to the financial aid office, insufficient circumstances do not include lack of knowledge of published deadlines, limited means of communication or email access, events occurring after the deadline, failure to complete the FAFSA based on tax filing status if estimated information is available, a parent’s refusal to provide information on the FAFSA or insufficient financial aid as a result of missing priority deadlines.</p>\n<p>Miller said extenuating circumstances could include, but are not limited to, getting ill, sustaining an injury or otherwise some event that prevents them from collecting the necessary documents. Miller urged students to check their university email account and check the financial aid website as a way to keep up to date on financial aid policies.</p>\n<p>The financial aid office has roughly $60 to $63 million dollars to distribute as well as 17,000 financial aid applicants annually, with average award amounts clocking in at around $6,300 per student. According to Miller, around 2,000 students or 10 percent of filers file their applications after the deadline, typically in September when students enroll for Fall and resume paying tuition.</p>\n<p>“A lot students just won’t complete that [application] until right before they need financial aid,” Miller said, “So there’s a huge delay and in some cases we’ll ask for documentation in March and April and sometimes they won’t turn it in until September and that’s a long time to be sitting on request for documentation especially when it comes to funding your education.”</p>\n<p>However, according to former announcements by the financial aid office, aid awards are distributed beginning in July.</p>\n<p>According to first-year global studies major Mayela Morales, other options aside from strict deadlines exist, including moving existing FAFSA workshops to earlier in the quarter to avoid conflicts with midterms and end-of-quarter academic pressures.</p>\n<p>“I feel like there is other options besides just completely cutting off the flexibility with the deadline,” Morales said. “I see their point of view but there’s other options, because by enforcing that March 2nd deadline you are completely cutting off someone’s financial aid.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major, Johanna, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she was not worried about the stricter policy affecting her because precise tax information can still be provided later as long as estimates are submitted with the application on time.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s an important deadline that has to be met, and I’ve never worried about missing the deadline so I don’t feel like the stricter policy affects me directly,” Johanna said in an email.</p>\n<p>Miller said the move to tighten restrictions is a campus decision without any push from the state or federal government, while most other campuses in the UC system enforce strict adherence to filing deadlines.</p>\n<p>“We would have several thousand students who just didn’t do anything for themselves until they come back in the fall,” Miller said. “So we would get a huge rush of financial aid applications in August and September and that really created kind of a log jam for us especially when the fee deadline was coming up.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, looser enforcement has been the norm because it allows for the most flexibility for students to receive money, but an increase in the number of “needy students” has put additional pressure on the office to distribute funding effectively. While part of the $63 million the office annually distributes is for usually set aside for late filers, having as many students as possible apply on time allows the office to better estimate how much funding will need to be distributed all students.</p>\n<p>“Say for example we have 95 percent of our students applying on time; that just gives us a much better baseline to begin the planning,” Miller said. “Just having a better idea of how many applicants we’re going to have on an annual basis, we can really budget out what we’re going to spend a lot more accurately.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61278\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/financial-aid-office-to-adhere-to-stricter-filing-deadlines/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61278\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/financial-aid-office-to-adhere-to-stricter-filing-deadlines/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/financial-aid-office-to-adhere-to-stricter-filing-deadlines/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/financial-aid-office-to-adhere-to-stricter-filing-deadlines/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/financial-aid-office-to-adhere-to-stricter-filing-deadlines/","id":2879,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2878,2877,2876],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
