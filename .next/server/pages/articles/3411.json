March Madness has once again met expectations, maybe even surpassed them following the upsets that have taken place thus far as we head into the Sweet 16. Staff writer Brandon Victor...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One reason I love March Madness so much is the sheer unpredictability. No one knows what’s going to happen. I can’t tell you how many articles I’ve read over the years that “claim” to have all the answers for your bracket. No matter how much research you do, no matter how much you think you know about college basketball, you won’t get a perfect bracket. Sorry.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to claim to have any definite answers here; I’ve been making brackets since age seven, and I can’t even tell you how many years someone who has no knowledge of basketball has beaten me. What I do aim to do, however, is to break down each region, and at least tell you what to look for in the incredible time that is March Madness.</p>\n<p>With the Sweet 16 set to begin on Thursday, March 22, my reasoning for not having any “definite answers” should speak for itself. Man, UMBC!? Who would have have ever thought? Not to mention the other upsets that have taken place within this past week.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Update: Like many of my fellow March Madness viewers, my bracket is busted.

They lead the nation in points per game, coming into the tournament averaging a cool 87.1 ppg– and that’s in the Big East, by no means a weak conference this year. Their offense runs through veteran Jaelin Brunson, who played a key role in ‘Nova’s championship two years ago. One of the most efficient players in the nation, Brunson averages 19 points a game on only 13 shots a game, and has 2.5:1 turnover to assist ratio. Junior wing Mikal Bridges helps shoulder some of the load as well, scoring 18 points a game for a team that shoots almost 40 percent from the three point line. In fact, the Wildcats have scored at least 71 points in every game this season.</p>\n<p>Cinderella Story</p>\n<p>Pinch me if you’ve heard this one before: Stephen F. Austin. As a 14 seed, picking them has a chance to backfire in my face very, very hard. But the Lumberjacks are 28-6 on the season, and it was just two years ago that they knocked off VCU in an overtime thriller. SFA has the ability to disrupt a team’s offense, leading the NCAA in turnovers created per game, and take on a Texas Tech team that seems to have peaked too early in the season. There’s the potential Keenan Evans goes off for the Red Raiders, but I’d bet on the Lumberjacks here.</p>\n<p>Dark Horse</p>\n<p>I think the two potential dark horses in this bracket come from the top half: 8th seeded Virginia Tech and 4th seeded Wichita State. Purdue should run through the bottom half of this bracket, given their size advantage over the other teams. If Virginia Tech can get past Collin Sexton and Alabama in the first game, they have the chance to make some noise against ‘Nova. Virginia Tech has already beaten Virginia, UNC, and Duke this season,and while they struggled at times against inferior competition, they could give the Wildcats a run for their money.</p>\n<p>If Wichita State can navigate past “Press Virginia”, they could also find themselves in a heated battle with Villanova. One of the most efficient teams in the nation, they are led by Point Guard Landry Shamet, who is averaging five assists per game and shooting 46 percent from beyond the arc. Gregg Marshall has proven in the past that the Shockers aren’t scared of any opponent, and with their balanced offensive attack (83 ppg), they’re one of the few teams in the field that can keep up with ‘Nova.</p>\n<p>My pick:</p>\n<p>Despite the hurdles of Wichita State and Virginia Tech, I think Villanova just has too much firepower. Purdue has a size advantage, but the Wildcats will be too quick and explosive.</p>\n<p><b>West Region</b></p>\n<p>Favorite:</p>\n<p>In my opinion, the West is far and away the weakest region, led by the worst number one seed, Xavier. Guard Trevon Bluiett is a bonafide star, averaging nearly 20 points per game, and has a balanced attack behind him in which seven other players average at least seven points a game. Xavier only lost five games all season in a tough Big East, and two of those losses came at the hands of Villanova. They can score, and they can score in bunches. What worries me the most about Xavier is their subpar defense– they give up almost 75 points a game, quite a bit for a team on the one line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cinderella Story</p>\n<p>Sure, I’m biased, but don’t be surprised if San Diego State makes a run in the tournament. The Aztecs have won nine games in a row, and just throttled a ranked Nevada team in the Mountain West tournament. While they lack a true star, Senior Guard Trey Kell has played outstanding of late, and San Diego State’s depth at the guard position allows them to not turn the ball over late. In addition, this team has proved they can play with anyone, beating Gonzaga earlier in the year. Don’t be surprised if they beat Houston in the first round, and give Michigan a run for their money in the second round.</p>\n<p>Dark Horse</p>\n<p>Speaking of the ‘Zags, don’t be surprised if they make yet another push late into March Madness. The key to this team is their balanced attack: at least five players average double digits. Senior forward Johnathan Williams can defend almost any position, and this team brings a heavy dose of experience to the table following their run last year. Averaging 84.5 points per game, don’t be surprised if this team knocks off Xavier.</p>\n<p>My pick</p>\n<p>One team that we haven’t talked about yet is last year’s national champion: North Carolina. Powered by senior guard Joel Berry and junior forward Luke Maye, the Tar Heels are an experienced bunch that can easily make a deep run, despite their ten losses this season. Maye has been outstanding this season, averaging a double-double, and the experience of Berry means that UNC will be able to withstand close games. I’m not entirely infatuated with them– they ranked ninth in the ACC in three point percentage, and lack depth beyond their two stars. But in this weak region, I think they’ll advance.</p>\n<p><b>South</b></p>\n<p>Favorite:</p>\n<p>The favorite in this region, and frankly the entire tournament,is Virginia. The Cavaliers play by far the best defense in the tournament, giving up less than 54 points per game. They are also efficient, if unspectacular, on the offensive end, putting up about 68 points per game. This UVA team is 31-2, and is able to control the pace of the game, slowing it down and making their defense the focal point of the game. A potential concern, however, is their lack of a true number one scoring option. Guard Kyle Guy averages about 13 points per game, and they don’t have someone who can truly take over the game if they need to get a basket at the end of the game.</p>\n<p><b>Cinderella Story</b></p>\n<p>While it wouldn’t shock me if Davidson knocks off Kentucky, my cinderella in this region is a Loyola-Illinois team that has been absolutely dominant the entire season. Coming in at 28-5, including a shocking victory over a very solid Florida team, the Ramblers have the make of a team that could make waves in the tournament. They have one of the top defenses in college basketball, giving up only about 62 points per game. On offense, they have four players that average over 10 points a game, and they each shoot greater than 50 percent from the floor. This efficient team will give fits to Miami in the first round, who will be without their star guard Bruce Brown. Look for the Ramblers to rumble on to the second round.</p>\n<p>Dark Horse</p>\n<p>It feels wrong to call such a celebrated program a dark horse, but, on the four line this season, my pick is the Arizona Wildcats. ‘Zona is led by freshman phenom Deandre Ayton, widely projected to be the top pick in this years NBA draft. In the pac-12 tournament, Ayton hammered his opponents, combining for 64 points and 32 rebounds in the last two games. No, that was not a typo. The program had to deal with the adversity of the FBI findings earlier in the year, but that seemed to actually bring the team together, given how well they performed in the tournament. An explosive offensive team, Arizona can beat anybody.</p>\n<p>My pick</p>\n<p>Building on that, I think Arizona will pull off the upset here and knock off both Virginia and Cincinnati. As I mentioned before, Virginia and Cincinnati are both plodding teams that control the tempo of the game and lock down their opponents. I think Arizona will speed up the game through sophomore guard Alonzo Trier, and will force both teams to score. In the end, their offenses will let them down, and in his (likely) last year at Arizona, Sean Miller will finally make the final four.</p>\n<p><b>Midwest</b></p>\n<p>Favorite:</p>\n<p>It’s hard to pick a favorite in such a top-heavy region, but on paper at least, the favorite is Kansas. Kansas is led by Senior guard Devonte Graham, who averages more than 17 points per game. That being said, this Jayhawk team has more cracks than most Bill Self teams. They’ve lost multiple times at Allen Fieldhouse this season– unheard of for a Kansas team, and how far they go depends on the health of their  sophomore center, Udona Azubuike. He is expected to be ready for their tournament opener, but he will need to be at full health for the Jayhawks to make a run.</p>\n<p>Cinderella Story</p>\n<p>One of the more popular upset picks this year is 12 seed New Mexico State, and for good reason. Historically, 12 seeds have the best chance of upsets– in the past five years, 10 different 12 seeds have won their first round game. But this Aggie team in general spells danger for Clemson, and even potentially Auburn. Senior guard Zach Lofton averages nearly 20 points a game, and could be a starter for most major programs. NMSU is 28-5 on the season, and their 38 ranking in BPI proves they can hang with anyone in the country. Clemson has struggled of late, going 6-5 since their star senior Donte Grantham went down with a torn ACL. And if they can get past the Tigers, Auburn has lost four of their last six games.</p>\n<p>Also, while I don’t expect them to win, Penn is rated as one of the best 16 seeds of all time. They went 24-8 in the Ivy League, and shoot a high percentage from behind the arc. Of course, a 16 seed has never beaten a one, but they hold the best chance of anyone in the field to do so.</p>\n<p>Dark horse:</p>\n<p>There’s no real dark horse in this incredibly top-heavy group. Kansas, Duke, and Michigan State all feature balanced and extremely talented teams, but all of the other top seeds in this region are inherently flawed (see above for Clemson and Auburn). TCU has struggled after being ranked in the top ten earlier in the year, and both Rhode Island and Oklahoma have played incredibly mediocre basketball of late. No matter how much Trae Young does, it won’t matter unless the team looks like they want to play. That wasn’t the case in the Big 12 tournament, and it’s unlikely to be the case now.</p>\n<p>My pick</p>\n<p>This region is really a coinflip for me. This Kansas team isn’t as good as Kansas teams of the recent past, especially last year’s team with Frank Mason. Marvin Bagley could easily put Duke on his back, but they will only go as far as senior leader Grayson Allen will take them. He has been too inconsistent this year to trust him this year against both Michigan State and Kansas. When all is said and done, I think the Spartans will advance out of the region. Sophomore Miles Bridges plays with an IQ well beyond his age, and averages 17 points a game to lead the team. Freshman standout Jaren Jackson Jr., a likely lottery pick, has been able to dominate down low at times this year. And point guard Cassius Winston provides a steady hand at the point guard position, averaging seven assists a game compared to just over 2 turnovers a game.

Less than 24 hours after being arrested for domestic violence for the second time in the year — and subsequently being cut by the 49ers — second-year linebacker Reuben Foster was claimed immediately on waivers by the Washington Redskins.</p>\n<p>I know, I shouldn’t be surprised. NFL owners display an incorrigible lack of social awareness, and Redskins owner Dan Snyder is one of the worst offenders. Still, I can’t help but be disgusted. Truth be told, Foster should have been cut long ago by the 49ers. Already drafted with off-the-field issues, Foster was arrested in February for domestic violence and has reportedly had a police report filed against him last month. How many chances does one player get?</p>\n<p>Once again, the NFL displays their indifference toward violence against women. At his press conference this week, 49ers’ GM John Lynch said that releasing Foster “doesn’t mean we don’t love him.” In that conference, Lynch failed to mention the victim a single time. One would think the NFL would have learned from the Ray Rice situation, when in 2014 Rice was caught on video beating up his fiancé in an elevator. Somehow, Rice was only suspended for two games (for reference, smoking marijuana results in a four game suspension).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I remember writing an opinion piece in my high school newspaper about that incident, expressing both disappointment and dismay at Roger Goodell’s decision. This time, it is Dan Snyder who is purposely turning a blind eye toward violence against women. In today’s more socially aware society, with the #MeToo movement thriving, watching the NFL once again disregard domestic violence offences is beyond disheartening — it is unfathomable.</p>\n<p>As of now, Reuben Foster has been placed on the commissioner’s exempt list, meaning he is ineligible to play. Still, by signing Foster, the NFL makes him eligible to be present at the Redskins facility on a “reasonable basis.” Anyone who believes being back in an NFL facility is the best way for Foster to reform is incredibly naive. Senior VP for the Redskins Doug Williams stated that the decision was made after talking to a number of his former Alabama teammates, who defended the character of Foster. Sure, Foster has been arrested three times this year, but at least his college teammates said he was a real stand-up guy!</p>\n<p>The NFL does not care about women or domestic violence; they do not care about anything except lining their own pockets. Children look up to these athletes — so what kind of a message does it send when a player can get arrested twice in one year and still be signed immediately? More importantly, what kind of a message does it send to boys about how they should treat women?  At best, the NFL is apathetic toward violence against women; at worst, they are condoning the actions of these players, valuing wins over any sort of moral obligation.</p>\n<p>It is also impossible to look at this decision without wondering how Colin Kaepernick remains unsigned. How is it possible that a player who has been arrested twice in one year can get signed in a day, but Kaep remains unsigned? How is it possible that the Redskins last week signed Mark Sanchez — a mediocre quarterback best known for the infamous butt fumble who has only gotten worse with age — without even giving Kaepernick a workout?</p>\n<p>The message here is simple: African-American men can do anything they want, including being arrested for multiple felonies, as long as they don’t advocate for social change. To NFL owners, nonviolent protest is seen as a greater concern and threat to society than domestic violence. Everybody knows the NFL is never going to be a progressive league. After all, Snyder’s team is literally named the “Redskins,” a name Snyder laughably believes honors Native Americans. But it is becoming increasingly impossible for me to support — let alone watch — a league that refuses to take a stand against domestic violence.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 07 of the Nov. 29 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

The Baby-Faced Assassin. The Human Torch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry has earned a bunch of nicknames throughout his storied career. Already a two-time (and once unanimous) MVP, three-time champion and “greatest shooter ever” by the age of 31, Curry’s career is almost perfect. He’s currently playing against his younger brother in the Western Conference Finals and is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and former Virginia Tech Volleyball player Sonya Curry; to the casual observer it must look like he was destined for greatness. If you’ve followed him closely throughout the years, however, you would know that that wasn’t always the case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I certainly didn’t think I was watching an all-time great player when I first really started following the Warriors my freshman year of high school. Up to that point, my knowledge of the Dubs mostly revolved around my older family members’s memories of the Run TMC era, being snuck into Oakland bars as a kid to watch the 2007 We Believe Team and being oddly drawn to shooting guard Kelenna Azubuike because of his awesome name. I certainly remember feeling furious that Monta Ellis didn’t get an All-Star bid, and venting with my stepfather when we traded him for Andrew Bogut. Still, other than my friends and I (regrettably) nicknaming Curry “Noodle Legs” because of his ankle injuries, none of the early memories of my Warriors fandom really involved him.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That all changed in the 2012-13 NBA playoffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Warriors were a plucky six-seed that year led by second-year coach Mark Jackson and Steph Curry, who had garnered national attention earlier in the season when he scored 54 points against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Most Warriors fans at that point had conceded that trading Ellis was the right way to go, but I personally still wasn’t sure how far Curry could take us. Little did I know that this would be the debut of one of the most dominant postseason players the game has ever seen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steph was on fire in the first round against the Nuggets, torching the Denver defense for two 30-point performances sandwiched around a 29-point game, and leading the Warriors to their first playoff series victory in six years. When he then turned around and dropped 44 points in the first game of the Western Conference Semifinals on the Spurs, the whole league was put on notice </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people started to understand that this guard who had been hampered by injuries could really ball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He elevated himself from a good shooter to a great player, and after losing to the Clippers in an emotionally charged first-round series in 2014, the stage was set for him to truly take his game to the next level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that’s exactly what he did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curry did more than just change public perception during his first MVP season in 2015; he actually shifted the landscape of the entire NBA. While old heads like Charles Barkley dismissed the eventual champion Warriors as a “jump-shooting team,” while an East Coast-biased media elevated teams like the Hawks or Cavs over the Dubs, while Houston fans and their team obnoxiously campaigned for James Harden to win the Most Valuable Player award </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Steph and the Warriors just kept on winning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They eventually faced off against the “Grit ‘n Grind” Memphis Grizzlies in the second round of the 2015 playoffs, and as Curry sunk shots from the opposing free-throw line, it was almost as if we could see the passing of the torch right in front of our eyes. The Warriors’s ball movement, quick and smart defense and shot-making ability simply brushed off the outdated bully ball style of the Grizzlies, and it was all catalyzed by number 30.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steph would end up leading the Warriors to a championship, following up with the greatest offensive season in history in which he averaged 30.1 points on 50/45/90 shooting and won a unanimous MVP. Being hampered by injuries and losing in seven games to the Cavs would also bring over Kevin Durant to create the best duo to ever step on a basketball court.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two championships later, this is where we stand. Curry already has the resume of the second-best point guard of all time. He is the leader of the statistically greatest starting lineup in NBA history, ranks ninth in points per game in the playoffs and is blowing away three-point shooting records with ease. When Kevin Durant went down with an injury this year, it was Curry with 33 points in the second half of game six to bury the “rival” Houston Rockets and advance to the Western Conference Finals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only inconsistent part of Curry’s game now seems to be the criticism levied against him and his team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, the Warriors were unfair because they got Kevin Durant. Then the Warriors needed Kevin Durant in order to win the championship. At first, Curry isn’t “clutch” because he doesn’t have a finals MVP. Then when he does carry the team, he’s a “frontrunner” or “showboat”. At first, the Warriors were a soft jump-shooting team that lucked into a finals. Then they became an illegal-screening, dirty powerhouse that bullied lesser squads into oblivion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While media talking-heads try to get their narratives together before another Warriors championship victory, Curry just continues to add to his legacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is the most selfless superstar the game has seen, embodies a leader in the truest sense of the word and belongs on the Mount Rushmore of NBA players. He is not just part of the greatest offense in the league, but is himself the greatest offense in the league. His gravity and the way he stretches out opposing defenses is something that has never been seen before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When his career is done, when the Warriors are back to being a middle-of-the-pack team playing in an overpriced San Francisco stadium, when their championship hopes are nothing but a memory, he will be talked about in the same way we talk about legends like Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should be grateful that we get to see him in his prime now.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.
