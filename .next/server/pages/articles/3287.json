Lucky for you, you hit the jackpot. Welcome home.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I know it’s an exciting time for you. You’re finally starting to get a taste of what adult life is. You’ve heard the stories about how awesome a party school UCSB is. You’re going to be surrounded by a ridiculous amount of the most beautiful people you’ve ever met, inside and out.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It might be tough for you to leave everything you’ve ever known behind – your family and friends, the familiar streets you learned to drive on, your favorite restaurants, your dog – it’s not easy.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But what you get in return: the ultimate fresh start.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Forget the ex who cheated on you, the bullies, the dumbasses, the people you’ve been going to school with since kindergarten that still don’t even know your name. Here in SB, we’re all in this together.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Right now, you have the power to control where your life goes. You can go down any path, and many times, you’re going to regret your decisions… Many, many, many times, actually.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But no matter what mistakes you make, never let a bad experience keep you down; learn from it, grow, and do whatever you can to make it a positive influence on your life moving forward.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If there’s one piece of advice I can emphasize more than anything, it is this: always have an open mind. No matter what you’ve thought about something in the past, at the very least, ask yourself “Why?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Why is Friends the greatest show ever? Why am I a Democrat instead of Republican? Why am I against drinking or doing drugs? Why do I believe in God?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Never be afraid of the answers to life’s hardest questions. This is the time for you to learn who you are and what your position is on important issues. As Aristotle once said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">At the end of the day, college is only going to be what you make of it.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Okay, now that I’ve imparted some life-changing wisdom that you’ll remember for the rest of your life, it’s time to talk about sports. You may not have seen too much of UCSB on ESPN or anything, but our teams do in fact kick ass.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For example, last season, our men’s volleyball, men’s water polo and baseball teams were ranked as high as No. 3, No. 5 and No. 6 in the nation, respectively.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I’m sure you’ve also heard about our men’s soccer team, which has finished with the No. 1 seed in the Big West in each of the last two seasons.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If you’re going to make it to any one game this season, make sure it’s men’s soccer against Cal Poly. When we hosted them last year, it was in front of the second-largest crowd in NCAA history. And if the image of tortillas flying recklessly through the air in all directions excites you, then you’ll be happy to hear that that’s how we celebrate goals. Make sure you cover your head, though.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now, if you want to get in on the sports action yourself, then you’re also in luck. We have an excellent intramural community that gives you fun, organized competition for a large variety of sports and talent levels. You’ll sometimes even have the chance to play with UCSB athletes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For those of you that want to get behind the scenes, interviewing future professional athletes, writing articles about the sports you love and seeing what it’s like to be a journalist, then feel free to either e-mail us or come by the Nexus office and meet either myself or our assistant sports editor, Sean White.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">So, with that being said, take a look down below and begin your tour of the teams you’ll be rooting for in the near future.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wishing you a fantastic and successful time here at UCSB,</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Michael J</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Gauchos Do It Better</strong> – Sean White</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Thank you summer for the fun, but it’s time to get back to the grind. Welcome back to all the returning students, and greetings to the new class of freshmen. I hope all of you are ready to embark on your new journey as Gauchos!</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My name is Sean White (yes… almost like the snow/skate boarder) and I am entering my second-year as a Pre-Communication major. This is my second year as a writer and first-year as an editor for the Daily Nexus. I am looking forward to providing UCSB with the best content and coverage of its sports.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It’s crazy that I was just in your position preparing for my first year of college. Trust me, it goes by fast so make sure you enjoy every second of being a Gaucho.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My one suggestion for having a successful school year is simply making sure that you attend as many sporting events as possible. It’s the best way to overcome the stresses of school and take a break from the party scene. When you have teams that are talented and entertaining like UCSB does, it makes college more enjoyable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There’s no one sport at UCSB that I can tell you to commit to because they all have so much to offer. You’ve probably heard that UCSB is only a soccer powerhouse, but don’t let that deceive you. Our school may not receive much attention in mainstream sports headlines, but the experiences and memories gained from any UCSB sporting event are incomparable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While rankings and statistics help measure a team’s capability, it’s the atmosphere and energy of being in the Thunderdome, Harder Stadium, or any other UCSB venue that makes each moment meaningful. Since coming to UCSB, it has been the experience factor that has increased my interest in sports that I did not have much knowledge about.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As an only child, I guess you could call sports that brother or sister that I never had. I was once that kid with dreams of going to the NFL. Although UCSB does not have a football team, attending this school has made me realize how diverse sports are.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Writing for the Nexus has been everything that I hoped to do in my pursuit of a career within sports media and is responsible for my interest in learning more about sports such as volleyball, water polo, soccer, golf, and more. Even if you attend just one game, I hope that at the end of the school year you all can reminisce on the great times you had while cheering for our Gauchos.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With that being said, I hope all of you have a wonderful year. Be sure to follow us on Twitter for everything UCSB sports related: @thenexus_sports.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Thank you,</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sean</p>\n<div

four-year, $87.6 million ($60 million guaranteed) contract extension with the Seattle Seahawks is an offseason move that we eventually expected and are all glad to see be completed.</p>\n<p>There was much curiosity as to whether or not Seattle and Wilson would come to an agreement before the start of training camp. Despite Wilson’s new contract not ending with him being the highest-paid quarterback in the NFL, it’s a much more comforting difference from the $1.5 million salary he was set to make heading into the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>Wilson is now the second highest-paid quarterback in the NFL behind the Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers with an average salary per year of $17.82 million. Also, his $60 million in guaranteed money is tied for third-most in the NFL among current quarterback contracts behind Pittsburg’s Ben Roethlisberger and San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While on paper Wilson is set to make more than half the amount of money his contract entitles, that guaranteed money doesn’t fully become his just yet.</p>\n<p>Of the $60 million Wilson plans on making in guaranteed money, only the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/russell-wilson-contract-guarantees-2015-8\">first year of his four-year contract</a>–$31.7 million, is fully guaranteed. The total of $31. 7 million stems from a $31 million signing bonus and $700 thousand base salary.</p>\n<p>With the rest of Wilson’s contract depending on his future as the Seahawk’s quarterback, it’s assumed that he will definitely remain in Seattle and collect the money he is owed.</p>\n<p>As Seattle tries to retain as many of its primary impact players that have helped the Seahawks get to two consecutive Super Bowls, not giving Wilson the top notch contract he wanted is just fine.</p>\n<p>With the Seahawks salary cap already spent on keeping players such as Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas, Marshawn Lynch, and recently Bobby Wagner, now the NFL’s highest-paid middle linebacker after signing a four-year extension worth $43 million ($22 million guaranteed), <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/08/03/seahawks-cant-pay-many-any-more-guys/\">Seattle can only spend so much on players it plans on keeping for the future.</a></p>\n<p>While Seattle may have thought it was done handing out contract extensions, star safety Kam Chancellor is currently holding out from training camp in search of more money. After signing a contract extension with the Seahawks in 2013 worth $35 million for five-years, Chancellor is scheduled to make a base salary of $4.55 million this season.</p>\n<p>In the midst of negotiating player contracts, Seattle has begun its process of releasing players in order to increase salary cap space. Surprisingly, starting defensive tackle Tony McDaniel was released and it’s expected that the Seahawks will probably cut more players and search for cheaper talent. Although McDaniel has been a pivotal piece of Seattle’s defensive front, it’s amazing to see how the business of professional sports outweighs performance sometimes.</p>\n<p>Situations such as Chancellor’s and various others that have decided to hold out are examples of why players have voiced their opinions in the past. In regard to contracts, with the NFL being one of the nation’s top sports industries, players believe that they deserve the guaranteed money and leverage when negotiating that NBA and MLB players have.</p>\n<p>For instance, back in May Minnesota Vikings’ running back Adrian Peterson stated his <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/adrian-peterson-twitter-4\">frustration of franchises having control over player contracts. </a></p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how things pan out between Chancellor and the Seahawks. At the end of the day, Seattle’s effort and success to maintain key pieces must be applauded. However, is it too concerned with keeping its best players and ignoring the possibility of underpaying its role players?</p>\n<p>No one knows what Seattle’s next decision concerning its roster</p>\n<p>will be, but knowing that Wilson will be a Seahawk for years to come is the team’s biggest win so far this offseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

She has saved thousands of lives and influenced many more to be true to themselves, making this not only a win for the LGBTQ community, but a win for our increasingly accepting and constantly evolving society as a whole.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64408\" style=\"width: 265px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1147706998\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64408\" data-attachment-id=\"64408\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/becky/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?fit=960%2C703&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,703\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Becky\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?fit=250%2C183&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?fit=888%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64408\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?resize=255%2C187\" alt=\"Becky\" width=\"255\" height=\"187\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Becky.jpg?resize=250%2C183&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64408\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of kirotv.com</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>First-Ever Female NBA Coach Wins Summer League Title </strong>by Elliot Thornton</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The NBA Summer League is officially a wrap. This Vegas showcase is where college rookies take center stage and prove to GMs why they deserve a shot to be in the pros. But this summer wasn’t all about the players — it was also about a coach.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Becky Hammon led the San Antonio Spurs to their first summer league championship as the first female head coach in NBA history. In a dogfight against the Phoenix Suns with over 80,000 fans in attendance, it was Hammon’s coaching and poise that led her Spurs to a dramatic 93-90 victory.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Following 15 years in the WNBA, Hammon decided to put her pro career aside and do something no other female would dare try: join the NBA. On Aug. 5, 2014 the San Antonio Spurs hired Hammon as the first-ever female assistant coach.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Under the wing of mentor Gregg Popovich, the former San Antonio Star learned the ropes of the NBA very quickly. The torch was passed this summer as she took over the men’s summer league team and she didn’t disappoint.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hammon’s journey to the NBA has been remarkable. From being an undrafted rookie in the WNBA to her six all-star appearances in the league and now having a Summer League title under her belt, critics can only applaud her accomplishments. But her job is not done yet.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For now, it’s safe to say that Becky Hammon has a heart of a champion, breaking barriers not only for herself, but for women everywhere.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64410\" style=\"width: 350px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Serena.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1942169891\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64410\" data-attachment-id=\"64410\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/celebrities-at-wimbledon-2015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Serena.jpg?fit=636%2C421&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"636,421\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;WireImage&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D4S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 11:  Serena Williams of the United States celebrates with the Venus Rosewater Dish after her victory in the Final Of The Ladies' Singles against Garbine Muguruza of Spain during day twelve of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships at Wimbledon on July 11, 2015 in London, England.

But at the age of 33, Serena Williams remains one of the most dominant athletes in the world. On July 11, Williams heightened her prominence atop women’s tennis by earning her 21st Grand Slam victory at Wimbledon.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As Williams’ name continues to ascend in the record books amongst the legendary careers of players such as Germany’s Steffi Graf and Australia’s Margaret Smith Court, the nation’s No. 1 player recreated her own history with the win.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It had been 12 years since she achieved her first “Serena Slam,” but after winning at Wimbledon, Williams repeated the feat of being tennis’ ultimate winner. This year’s “Serena Slam” is the second time in Williams’s career that she is the current champion of each of the four Grand Slam events. Also, the victory at Wimbledon made Williams the oldest women’s tennis player to win a Grand Slam event.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now, you may be questioning what is left for Williams to conquer in the latter years of her career, but the answer is simple: to win. Besides being just one win away from tying Graff’s record of 22 Grand Slam titles, Williams is on the verge of achieving a task she never has before.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nearly a month away from its arrival in September, the U.S. Open is the next major event that Williams is scheduled to play in. A win in this event would not only award Williams with her seventh U.S. Open, but it would place her on women’s tennis’ most prestigious platform. Williams would become just the second player to win each of the Grand Slam events in the same calendar year, Graf being the first.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64411\" style=\"width: 273px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pierre.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1526036065\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64411\" data-attachment-id=\"64411\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/pierre/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pierre.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Tim Heitman\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS-1D X\",\"caption\":\"Sep 8, 2013; Arlington, TX, USA;  New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul (90) on the sidelines during the fourth quarter of the game against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&amp;T Stadium.

Players have gone as far as to donate thousands of dollars in support of researching the best protective gear and, in some cases, even sued their respective leagues for the unfortunate outcomes that are connected to physical activity in their sport of play. It seems as if most athletes take their own safety into heavy consideration when on the field of play, so it is very surprising to hear of acts where athletes fail to display this attention when off the field.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Just this past Independence Day, NFL players Jason Pierre-Paul of the New York Giants and CJ Wilson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers both suffered finger amputations due to injuries sustained during separate firework accidents. Pierre-Paul lost his right index finger while Watson lost both his right index and middle fingers. Given their defensive positions, these injuries have proven to be career-altering. Pierre-Paul, who was franchise tagged, but hoping to earn a long-term deal instead, lost his opportunity of the desired deal just hours after the accident. Moreover, Wilson’s incident led him to recently retire with hopes of returning to the NFL once recovered and healthy.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It is hard to understand how these players, who are concerned with safety so much in the game, can sometimes be very careless outside of it. Both of these men make a living using their hands, and their actions could have cost their teams, families and themselves a lot more. Although this may be the most severe occurrence in outside injuries, this is not the only example. We can point to Andrew Bynum who missed an entire season with the Philadelphia 76ers after hurting his leg bowling. Or Rory Mcllroy, who just missed the British Open due to a ruptured Achilles he got while playing soccer. It’s inevitable that these accidents do happen, but one would expect athletes of professional caliber to be more responsible.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"685842556\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64412\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/big-al/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?fit=320%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"320,238\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"big al\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?fit=320%2C238&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"  wp-image-64412 alignleft\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?resize=246%2C183\" alt=\"big al\" width=\"246\" height=\"183\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/big-al.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>‘Big Al’ Heading to China </strong>by Michael Jorgenson</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Whether you follow UCSB sports or not, you’ve most likely at some point heard of “Big Al,” the UCSB men’s basketball team’s all-time leader in rebounds and second all-time leader in points. After graduating this past school year, Alan Williams went undrafted before playing for the Houston Rockets in the NBA Summer League, where he represented the Gauchos and amazed the crowds with averages of 20.5 points and a summer-league leading 11.8 rebounds per game. While his efforts didn’t land him a spot on an NBA roster for the upcoming season, he recently made the announcement that he is heading overseas to play for the Qingdao Double Star Eagles of the Chinese Basketball Association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"934974252\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64404\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64414\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/summer-2015-rewind/deandre/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?fit=590%2C354&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"590,354\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deandre\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?fit=250%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?fit=590%2C354&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-64414\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?resize=282%2C169\" alt=\"deandre\" width=\"282\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?w=590&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deandre.jpg?resize=250%2C150&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>DeAndre Jordan Agrees to Contract with Mavs … But Re-Signs with Clips? </strong>by Jack Mathews</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With a max contract all but signed, center DeAndre Jordan seemed to finally have what he wanted with intentions of joining the Dallas Mavericks. It left Los Angeles Clippers fans startled by the fact that their star center was off to Dallas to clean up boards for their conference rivals.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But as the days passed and rumors swirled about the potential return of Jordan to L.A., the tables turned against Mavericks fans which made the hearts of Clippers fans swell with joy.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For the last seven seasons, the athletic Jordan has filled highlight reels and been a driving force behind the birth of “Lob City.” His defense and rebounding are irreplaceable and it was hard to imagine a title run without “DJ” in the mix.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Suddenly, the urgent scramble to lure Jordan back to L.A. led Clippers players, owners and coaches to “camp out” at Jordan’s Houston home until the moratorium period ended.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Before anyone knew it, the weirdest offseason situation in recent memory ended with DeAndre Jordan returning to Los Angeles and leaving Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and fans with a bitter taste in their mouths.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Although this may be one of the most surprising free agency scandals ever witnessed, one thing is for sure: The Clippers are loaded, and Lob City will be in full effect this season.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>NFL Offseason’s Biggest Moves </strong>by Daniel Moebus-Bowles</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In an offseason that is crowded by suspensions and lawsuits, the actual trades and pickups being made by NFL teams have been deflated in media coverage to this point. This has definitely been unfortunate due to the fact that this offseason has been very exciting for many players and a couple of teams in particular.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Indianapolis Colts, who already have one of the best quarterbacks in the league, a strong defense and a great group of receivers, added some phenomenal pieces to complete their all-star caliber team. This season, Frank Gore and Andre Johnson will suit up in blue to revamp an already potent offense. In addition, the Colts got more protection for Andrew Luck in Todd Herremans and added savvy veterans in Kendall Langford and Trent Cole to their defense. Simply put, Indianapolis is deserving of being one of Vegas’s Super Bowl winning predictions.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Buffalo Bills have become very intriguing with their pickups that include new Head Coach Rex Ryan and a defense he is building for himself. With LeSean “Shady” McCoy on board, the Bills have a very exciting offense that could possibly shock many with quarterback Matt Cassel being the team’s possible starter. Quite honestly, Buffalo will be just as hit-or-miss as the team McCoy came from.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Chip Kelly has set himself up to be either the biggest hero or the biggest bonehead in Philadelphia Eagles history. He has completely redesigned a team that had a 10-6 record under Mark Sanchez last year. Only time will tell if Chip is impulsive or wise in moves.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the individual side, Ndamukong Suh and Jimmy Graham have made the biggest moves, racking up some cash along the way. Suh moved to the Dolphins and became the highest paid non-quarterback in the NFL as Graham joined the Seattle Seahawks. It’s too bad the Seahawks didn’t have Graham for that last red zone pass … just maybe, things would have ended differently.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Sepp Blatter Finally Gets the Boot </strong>by Michael Jorgenson</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Well, it’s about damn time. After FBI investigators finally stepped in to take a look at the blatant corruption taking place within the soccer world, Sepp Blatter was finally forced to step down as FIFA president in early June. Maybe we won’t have the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after all. Good riddance.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>College Football Playoffs Part II</strong> by Elliot Thornton</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In 2014, a new era of college football was born with the College Football Playoffs. After a back-and-forth battle between the top two teams, the Ohio State Buckeyes and Oregon Ducks, the second-half surge of running back Ezekiel Elliott sealed the deal for the Buckeyes and crowned them the first ever College Football Playoff champions with a 42-20 victory.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But as last season is put to rest and a new season approaches, all eyes are on Head Coach Urban Meyer and his crew to prove themselves against the toughest competition in the nation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Among these teams lies the rolling Alabama Crimson Tide. After a 35-42 upset and a long ride back to Tuscaloosa, Head Coach Nick Saban and his men stored that bitter loss to Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl in their memory and are out for vengeance.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While losing a couple key pieces from their run to the championship game last year, like quarterback Blake Sims, running back T.J. Yeldon and star wideout Amari Cooper, younger talent has emerged and is ready to step up.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Derrick Henry hopes to be the primary weapon for the Crimson Tide offense. The junior running back took 170 handoffs behind Yeldon last year and averaged a staggering 5.8 yards per carry. Henry also led the team in rushing with 990 yards and broke the plane 11 times.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With a 6’3″ 240 lb frame, Henry will be a valuable asset to Saban and his dominant offensive line.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Another team on the rise is Bama rival, the Auburn Tigers. With the departure of quarterback Nick Marshall to the NFL draft, expectations are high for Head Coach Gus Malzahn and his new team.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The sky is the limit for quarterback Jeremy Johnson. The junior impressed scouts in the Auburn spring game on July 19th, passing for 252 yards and two touchdowns in the first half.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While Auburn’s defense is a concern on the back end and the timetable of injured lineman Carl Lawson is still questionable, there is no doubt that the Tigers will make a solid run in the talented SEC.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Clippers Going All-In With Championship-or-Bust Mentality </strong>by Jack Mathews</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sixteen NBA championships have been won in the city of Los Angeles; however, none of them belong to the Clippers. Still, the momentum has clearly shifted the last few years as the Clippers have won 50-plus games for the past three consecutive seasons while the Lakers have had some of their worst seasons in franchise history.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With hopes of winning their first championship in team history, this offseason has shown that “Lob City” will do whatever it takes to win it all. After a disappointing loss to the Houston Rockets in the second round of the NBA Playoffs, (as a life-long Clippers fan this still pains me to write) the Clippers took the “if you can’t beat them, sign them” approach.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Clippers added NBA veterans Josh Smith and Pablo Prigioni, both members of the Rockets this past season, to provide some much-needed depth to a bench that was highly criticized throughout the year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Smith is the much more talented of the two, and will undoubtedly contribute more. Nonetheless, Prigioni’s defense and energy off the bench will be huge down the stretch when an aging Chris Paul needs a few extra minutes on the bench.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Los Angeles’ other two moves earlier in the offseason highlighted the “championship or bust” mentality they are taking into this season. The Clippers added fiery guard Lance Stephenson in a trade that sent Matt Barnes to Charlotte, who is now with the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Stephenson is most commonly known for blowing in LeBron James’ ear when the Pacers played the Heat in the 2014 Eastern Conference Finals. But what people do not remember is how well Stephenson played LeBron defensively. He will be able to match up with the best players’ night in and night out, which will be huge on decreasing the minutes for players like Blake Griffin, Chris Paul and the Clippers’ final offseason addition, Paul Pierce.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The ten-time all-star is reuniting with his former Head Coach Doc Rivers, whom he won a championship with in Boston back in 2008.

Cueto is a rental player who will be too expensive for Kansas City to keep at the end of the season, but the Royals have the potential to go back to the World Series again this year, so they knew it was their time to make a splash at the trade deadline for arguably the best pitcher available.</p>\n<p>Other trades of note include starting pitcher Scott Kazmir going from the Oakland Athletics to the Houston Astros, who are still surprising many critics who did not believe this young team would be ready to compete for a couple more years.  Outfielder Shane Victorino is now an Angel, reliever Tyler Clippard a Met, and Jose Reyes is a Rockie.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With two wildcard spots in each league, there are so many more teams in the hunt for a playoff spot, making it harder for teams to call themselves sellers. The Cubs, Mets, Giants, and Pirates are all contenders in the National League, and it will be entertaining to see which of these teams makes the biggest move to try and win a place in the wildcard game. Expect the Chicago Cubs to do something big this week, working a trade for either David Price or Cole Hamels, the two top remaining starters on the market.</p>\n<p>In the American League, the Toronto Blue Jays need pitching in order to give themselves a chance at a playoff spot, something they haven’t achieved since they won consecutive World Series titles in 1992-1993. This team has the best offense in baseball, but the eighth worst pitching staff. After picking up Troy Tulowitzki from Colorado, look for Toronto to pick up the White Sox’ ace Jeff Samardzija to bolster its pitching staff.</p>\n<p>Looking at the rest of the AL, the Minnesota Twins have to make a trade if they want to have a chance at making the playoffs. This team is a head-scratcher and I’m surprised they are in the position they are in, but if they don’t trade for a bat like the Padres’ Justin Upton, the Twins will fall out of the playoff race soon.</p>\n<p>With not many hours left, hopefully your favorite team’s general manager doesn’t doze off and miss the opportunity to get your team to the promise land.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64381\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-29/mlb-trade-deadline-update/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64381\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-29/mlb-trade-deadline-update/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-29/mlb-trade-deadline-update/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-29/mlb-trade-deadline-update/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-29/mlb-trade-deadline-update/","id":3286,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[3285,3284,3283],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
