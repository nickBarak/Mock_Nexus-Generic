But as they arrived, ready in their rain boots and warm layers, they found that Treasure Island was the grossly unprepared one. The festival was continuously way behind schedule and even canceled artists minutes before they were about to come on. Here’s the low-down on some of the ones that actually ended up playing:</p>\n<p><strong>Young Thug</strong></p>\n<p>After a wait of three hours — not 30 minutes of which passed by under a torrential downpour — Young Thug finally took the stage. He apologized for travel complications and quickly started his set. The crowd was very low-energy; after waiting three hours, it was to be expected. Throughout his entire set, Thug would try to hype up the crowd and ask, “If you’re ready to turn up, say, ‘hell yeah,’” but the “hell yeahs” were pretty sad. However, this didn’t last for long: Toward the end, when he started singing “Pick up the Phone,” the crowd’s enthusiasm was back. You could hear people singing and dancing along, with various shouts of, “It’s LIT!” during the song. Despite the rough start, Young Thug definitely put everyone back in a good mood by the end.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Glass Animals</strong></p>\n<p>Glass Animals put on a solid performance despite the short amount of time they had on stage. The creepy, cool voice of Dave Bayley spread through the crowd and gave everyone chills during “Toes.” The chilly, windy, post-rain atmosphere matched the vibes of Glass Animals’s set. Playing songs from both <em>Zaba </em>and<em> How to Be a Human Being</em>, the set combined older favorites with newer jams. “Cane Shuga” — a song from their recent album that isn’t very popular, what with its simple synth background beats — stood out like a hidden gem. Finally, Glass Animals ended with a favorite: “Gooey.” Everyone in the crowd was singing and moving to the catchy, buzzing tune.</p>\n<p><strong>Zhu</strong></p>\n<p>Zhu is a performer who is never afraid to change it up. At his TIMF set, one of his band members began with a guitar solo of “The Star-Spangled Banner” with a huge projected Zhu flag on the back screen. This differed from his performance at Coachella, which was a bit more mysterious with lots of fog and smoke. Both of these performances, however, show Zhu to be an artist who values production as much as music. Every one of Zhu’s intros and outros was remixed in new and unexpected ways. Many of the songs he played were accompanied by energetic guitar and saxophone solos, and he also sang all of his songs live while DJing. His voice, a high falsetto, only further adds to his mysterious, sensual aesthetic. The lights flashed black, white and red as the screen depicted hints of a cityscape. As the crowd listened, the combination of vocals and the dark visuals added to Zhu’s enigmatic persona. In addition, attendees who’d caught him just a few days before on his tour confirmed that his Treasure Island set was completely different. Zhu is always two steps ahead of the crowd. Toward the end of his set, he started playing “One Minute to Midnight,” but just as the crowd started anticipating the song, he immediately transitioned to one of his more hype tracks, “Hold Up Wait a Minute.” Zhu continues to push live mixing to its boundaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Tycho</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73362\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1379438551\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73361\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73362\" data-attachment-id=\"73362\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/treasure-island-fest-rains-on-own-parade/image3-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?fit=4032%2C3024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4032,3024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73362\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?w=4032&amp;ssl=1 4032w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image3.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73362\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Tycho recently dropped a new album, <em>Epoch</em>. His live set, which was during the late afternoon, was a bit more mellow of an experience than many of the other acts. But don’t confuse mellow for boring; combined with his visuals, which comprised of Grand-Canyon-like natural footage superimposed with funky oranges and pinks, his sound seemed to take you away to another place. Although he played specific cuts from all of his albums, his entire set seemed like one connected experience with seamless transitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Sylvan Esso</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73363\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"949299361\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73361\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73363\" data-attachment-id=\"73363\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/treasure-island-fest-rains-on-own-parade/image2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?fit=4032%2C3024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4032,3024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73363\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?w=4032&amp;ssl=1 4032w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image2.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73363\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ateken Abla / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Thought to be just a one-album project, Sylvan Esso recently released a single, “Radio.” This surprised many fans, giving them hope that they would release a new album. The DJ-singer duo who rarely tour was one of the more special performances of the weekend. Nick Sanborn and Amelia Meath took the stage and announced that this would be their last performance before they dropped their next album, and excitement ensued. Amelia captivated the audience with her crazy dance moves and crazy-good voice. At this point of the evening on the second night, there had already been so much rain that the mud covered people’s shoes. But it didn’t matter: When she sang  “H.S.K.T.,” everyone in the crowd was dancing and pointing to their heads, shoulders, knees and toes as she sang the chorus.</p>\n<p>This was Treasure Island’s 10th Anniversary and last year on San Francisco Bay’s Treasure Island. The eclectic lineup and their talented performances were the main attraction. But while the performances themselves were phenomenal, the music festival was supremely disorganized. Some of the main acts during the evening like Duke Dumont, Flight Facilities and James Blake were cancelled due to rain or wind. Treasure Island advertised as being a rain-or-shine festivalbut could not deliver. Had they planned the necessary precautions for the weather or even communicated better about set times and artist changes, the festival would have run much more smoothly.</p><div

Barbara. Wild Nothing is a critically acclaimed indie-pop band solely created by Jack Tatum in 2009. At the time, Tatum was finishing his senior year of college, but that didn’t stop him from releasing Wild Nothing’s debut album <i>Gemini,</i> which brought an immense amount of attention to Tatum’s dreamlike and nostalgic style.</p>\n<p><i>Gemini </i>features a variety of songs that showcase Tatum’s unique approach to creating music. The songs feature beautiful and whimsical keyboard sounds as well as simple but sweet additions from the guitar. <i>Gemini </i>ultimately evokes a sense of longing through Tatum’s dim lyrics, but still presents hints of light by pairing soft pop beats with peaceful rhythms. The initial song on this album, “Live in Dreams,” immediately represents the more somber approach Tatum takes when writing lyrics and creating sounds. Other songs on this album such as “Bored Games” and “Summer Holiday” are calm, beautiful tracks that force you to feel nostalgic for anything, whether it’s childhood, old love or a past memory. Wild Nothing knows how to be an innovative force in the current indie music scene.  Tatum effortlessly makes you grasp the sentiment and longing you’ve pushed back and tried to rid yourself of. The talented indie artist cultivates within listeners that it is okay to be feel nostalgia and to reflect on the beauty of the past. This is ultimately what Wild Nothing does to us with <i>Gemini </i>and this is without a doubt what to expect if you catch them in concert at the SOhO Restaurant and Music Club on Tuesday, Oct. 18.</p>\n<p>Tatum continued to develop his synth-heavy brand of music with the release of perhaps Wild Nothing’s most acclaimed album, <i>Nocturne.</i> This album shares similar stylistic traits as <i>Gemini,</i> but Tatum dives deeper in providing a more soothing and holistic sound for listeners. The leading tracks on<i> Nocturne</i>, “Paradise” and “Shadow,” are undeniably luscious, gentle and blissful songs. This album and Wild Nothing collectively are the epitome of ‘80s dream-pop, a unique quality that Wild Nothing brings to the current indie scene. Each song on <i>Nocturne </i>possesses delicate rhythms and soft, alluring sounds that paint light-colored images. “Through the Grass” and “Nocturne” are just two of the many songs on this album that give listeners a truly introspective experience, and this is what makes Wild Nothing such an avant-garde project in the indie music realm. Overall, Tatum does an exceedingly well job of crafting glimmering and echoing sounds with <i>Nocturne</i>, and provides listeners a simply beautiful, elegant and delicate album to indulge in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Wild Nothing is definitely worth seeing live.

After the lull of summer, I.V. is again filled with students enjoying their community and ready to see some fun-filled live shows. With so many new and returning Isla Vista residents, the UCSB Community Housing Office, the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District welcomed everyone with the Kick-Off Community Concert. The event served as a housing fair, educational center and venue for Isla Vista talent.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anisq’oyo’ Park was set up as a maze of tables for the event. Representatives from many I.V. property providers were there offering cookies, lemonade and information about their properties. The Isla Vista Tenants Union sparked interest in passersby with games and prizes such as succulents and various home goods. A photo booth was nestled in the back of the park with fun hats and accessories. The atmosphere was festive and welcoming as people talked, ate and lounged on the grassy hill of the park’s amphitheater. What really drew the crowds, however, was the upbeat music permeating I.V.’s usual cacophony of sounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Real Savage Henry was first to perform, reinstating their presence as a staple of the Isla Vista music scene. They brought their usual persona of fun and humor to the stage, wearing novelty accessories like a captain’s cap and a sailor hat. Wilder Kehke danced barefoot across the stage with his guitar and a carefree air of enjoyment. Even when many people were still roaming through the tables instead of sitting down to watch, the band remained lively and interactive with their initially small audience. They called out “Thank you!” to the applauding group at the very back of the amphitheater. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band’s first few songs were mellow and jazzy, reminiscent of coffee-house tunes to match the laid-back atmosphere of the event. The songs were heavy on the drums, with drummer Will Hettel laying down a slow but strong beat that pounded through the space. The beginning of the set had an improvisational feel as each song had an occasional piano solo. Andrew Mac Innes mixed up his steady pops of keyboard with sweeping scales and fast trills of notes. Guitar solos were common as well as Kehke held out long, wavering notes combined with quick, short bursts of riffing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Pagliassotti’s steady bass transitioned into quick, accented strumming as the beat began to pick up. Quick bursts from Mac Innes’s keyboard mirrored the faster bass line. Hettel’s drumming grew louder and faster as Kehke’s hands flew up and down the guitar in frequent, wailing riffs. The pace never stayed too intense for too long, however, as the music quickly softened again to more mellow rhythms.

Graham Bunce’s upbeat, catchy bass line got the audience bobbing their heads and swaying to the beat from the very beginning, as spontaneous bursts of drums and symbols added a flair of excited energy to the song. Drummer Ryan Lowe demonstrated his talent with seemingly no effort, his sticks flying across the drums and every beat strong and intense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While singer and guitarist Bryan Rawn’s raspy voice was very characteristic of classic alternative rock, it was actually because he was under the weather, not imitating singers from the ‘90s. “As you can probably tell, I’m a little sick,” the singer apologized with a smile, “but you know what, we’re having fun!” The band had to stop one song because Rawn’s weakened voice wasn’t strong enough for the vocals, but they picked up again right away with another high-tempo number. Rawn hit impressive high notes with all his might and kept the song’s energy up with fast guitar strumming and stylish riffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who were new to the Isla Vista community or simply those who have been away for a while, the concert was an inclusive opportunity to learn about I.V. living while also getting a taste of the local talent. The organizations and bands of Isla Vista are here to kick off another great school year. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73282\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73282\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-18/iv-kicks-off-fall-with-community-concert/","id":6731,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6730,6729,6728],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Joey Alexander Trio: Prodigious","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/57e979d2bf15d.image_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/57e979d2bf15d.image_.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Alexander’s original compositions are simply inspirational.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Born on the island of Bali, Indonesia, Alexander first encountered a keyboard at age six and immediately knew piano was his calling, jazz piano in particular. Not only could he pick up virtually any blues composition by ear, but he could also improvise with a level of experience far beyond his years. In 2014 at the young age of 11, the musical genius was discovered by jazz legend Wynton Marsalis and flown out to New York for Marsalis’s all-star jazz concert at Lincoln Center. From there, his career took off. He’s released two solo albums and been nominated for two Grammys in just the past two years.</p>\n<p>This is Alexander’s first time on the road. He was accompanied by Juilliard graduate and two-time Grammy winner Ulysses Owen, Jr. on the drums and Berklee College of Music alum Reuben Rogers on upright bass. Celesta M. Billeci, executive director of the Arts &amp; Lectures program, introduced the band by simply stating, “I don’t even know how to describe what you’re about to see tonight except: Wow.”</p>\n<p>Greeted with tremendous applause, Alexander opened the show with a classic by John Coltrane called “Calm Down” followed by several original compositions. He received continuous encouragement from bass player Rogers, who periodically yelled out a supportive “yeah!” The trio as a whole was tremendously in sync; Alexander thrives in the syncopated rhythms of jazz. He studied classical music as a child, like the works of Mozart and Tchaikovsky, but always wanted to elaborate on it. Classical music is supposed to be played as written, though; you’re not supposed to embellish. Jazz, however, allows the freedom to express yourself, unlike classical composition, and you can tell it’s what the young virtuoso is meant to be playing.</p>\n<p>His bandmates perfectly complemented him with many impressive solos displaying their remarkable skills on their respective instruments. If you think Miles Teller was good in “Whiplash,” you obviously haven’t seen Owen, Jr. play yet. His hands moved so quickly they completely blurred. Rogers, the “jokester” of the gang according to Alexander, was having the time of his life on stage, yelling out and swaying with the music.</p>\n<p>Now, if you like music — which I assume you do if you’re reading this article — you’ll like Alexander’s original compositions. They’re simply inspirational. It’s more than just genius in its arrangement, it’s the notion of a 13-year-old following his dream and truly succeeding. Every silence and pause was precise and intentional. It’s the kind of music that makes you feel deep down in your core. It makes you want to get out of your seat and cheer, cry and grin. Many audience members shook their heads in disbelief. After the first piece, the woman to my left let out a quiet “Wow,” one you could only hear if you were sitting directly next to her. Everyone was thinking the same thing.</p>\n<p>After the show, Eleanor York was more than excited to share her thoughts about Alexander’s performance. “It was phenomenal. The way everyone played off of each other and with each other; it’s amazing for anyone, let alone a thirteen 13-year-old,” said York, who has followed Wynton Marsalis as a frequent patron of the Arts &amp; Lectures events for years and knew when Joey got his endorsement he was someone to look out for. “It was just delicious.”</p>\n<p>It’s hard to think of a word other than “adorable” to describe the pianist, but gifted will undoubtedly suffice. When he speaks, though he is not completely fluent in English, he is humble and compassionate. It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by Hans Christian Andersen: “Where words fail, music speaks.” While Joey’s English may not be the best, he certainly makes up for it with his music. His sound and soul are much older than 13 years, and when he plays you forget about his age. This was evident in the <em>two</em> standing ovations he received.</p>\n<p>I was left with only one question at the end of the night: is Joey good for a 13-year-old, or is he just good? I think it’s safe to say he’s just good.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/joey-alexander-trio-prodigious/","id":6732,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[6731,6730,6729],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
