Quickly, the bloodshot eyes and strong odor of alcohol led the officer to suspect a high level of intoxication. Also, she was not wearing shoes. The officer kindly asked the woman to sit on the curb until he finished his prior engagement with the unfortunate driver.</p>\n<p>Having let the vehicle go, he turned to the woman and asked what she needed. The woman, apparently following George Washington’s famed maxim, replied, “I’m drunk, I’m not going to lie.” When asked just how much she had drunk, the woman continued to show her truthful side, confessing, “[A] lot.”</p>\n<p>“I drink too much,” she added.</p>\n<p>When asked to stand up, her bare feet were unable to provide the necessary balance and the officer decided to arrest her.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>See Spot Drink…</p>\n<p>Saturday, Dec. 29, 2:00 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 700 block of Camino del Sur happened across a woman screaming and waving her arm in the air with a man behind her holding on to her shoulder.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached in their patrol car, the male subject left the agitated woman behind and proceeded to walk in the opposite direction at a brisk pace, looking back once to check out the situation.</p>\n<p>The officer, fearing the man would flee, sprung to action, jumping out of the car while yelling at him to come back. He did, albeit not as briskly as before.</p>\n<p>The officer started slapping handcuffs onto the subject, suspecting a possible assault. Suddenly the officer noticed that the man’s arrest was angering the woman. “You’re fucking arresting him?” she screamed out in a slurred and incoherent voice.</p>\n<p>The officer turned his attention to the 19-year-old woman, who he quickly determined was heavily intoxicated. Further questioning revealed the underling reason for her highly agitated state. Ignoring all the officer’s questions, the woman instead asked him, “Is my dog hurt?”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the drunken canine lover’s responses continued to involve her dog, despite the absence of any furry friends within the area.</p>\n<p>Further inquiry into the subject revealed that the 21-year-old man was a co-worker of hers who had simply offered to walk his friend home. The alcohol, however, had apparently blacked out any concrete memory of where she lived and the two wandered up and down the entire length of Camino del Sur for nearly an hour before they stumbled upon Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she spent the night in the doghouse, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Transporter<br>\nTuesday, Jan. 1, 12:35 a.m. – Choosing to roost between a hard place and a bush, a 20-year-old female woke up for the first time in 2008 to the glare of a Foot Patrol flashlight.</p>\n<p>Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive came across a woman wedged between a tall bush and a parked truck, seemingly asleep yet still standing. Her belt was half off and she seemed to have lost her shoes.</p>\n<p>When approached by deputies, the motionless woman mumbled, “I’m not driving them home.” When asked what she was doing, she repeated, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>Officers informed her that her sleep aid – the truck next to her – was empty, and no one else was present. The distinct lack of anyone to drive did not quell her concern, however. When asked why her belt was half off, she announced, much to officers’ surprise, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the woman to step out from between the truck and the bush and onto the sidewalk. Balance, however, was not the would-be-driver’s forte, and she stumbled and fell into the officer’s arms.</p>\n<p>The sleepy souse had a few fresh scratches on her arm, but was unable to explain their presence to the officer, apparently forgetting her recent stint in a bush.</p>\n<p>The women was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Photo</p></div>\n<p>California State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) recently introduced Senate Bill 900 (SB 900), known as the Coastal Oil Well Cleanup Act.</p>\n<p>SB 900 would require the California State Lands Commission to plug old oil wells in California waters “orphaned” by oil companies that go out of business and cease to be held responsible. The bill calls for an in-depth study of abandoned and unused oil wells concentrated along the Summerland and Ellwood beaches in Santa Barbara County.<br>\nJackson said the bill was inspired by a recent influx of oil onto Summerland Beach, leading to health warnings and beach closures over the past year.</p>\n<p>“This bill is a direct response to the issues we’ve been dealing with in Summerland in the oil fields there, [particularly] as a result of the Becker on-shore well which has been a problem in the Summerland area for decades,” Jackson said. “It was a well that was abandoned many years ago and was improperly capped.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, failure to properly cap the Becker on-shore well has been causing problems that affect the surrounding ocean and beaches.</p>\n<p>“This past year, it was leaking so measurably that it was creating all sorts of problems both in terms of odor it was emitting, and the crude oil that was finding its way onto the beaches and making it difficult for people to enjoy the beaches and the ocean,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the bill would allow the state to learn more about other oil wells along the California coast and about the issue of natural seepage.</p>\n<p>“This legislation requires that we study these wells to find out which ones are leaking and what it will take to cap them,” Jackson said. “Also importantly, we will study the whole issue of natural seepage to determine if there is any or more than a relatively absorbable amount.”</p>\n<p>Jackson also said SB 900 would ensure that State Lands Commission receive the funds and resources necessary to learn more about abandoned wells and cap-leaking wells.</p>\n<p>“If State Lands, which has the jurisdiction, fails to get the funding they need to cap this particular well, we will insure somewhere in the process, sooner rather than later frankly, we’ll be able to obtain the funds necessary in order to cap that well,” Jackson said. “It also gives State Lands the authority to do an analysis on the nearly 200 abandoned wells along the coast.”</p>\n<p>SB 900 is the beginning of a continuing effort to combat uncapped oil wells among the California coast, according to Jackson.</p>\n<p>“This [bill] is the beginning of the effort. If we achieve a regular funding mechanism, we hope we can address at least $2 million worth of the problem and perhaps more as we know exactly the full extent of the problem,” Jackson said. “The full time frame is yet unknown because we don’t know the full extent of the problem.”<br>\nJackson said she hopes to move the bill through the process and to the governor’s desk by the end of the 2016 State Senate session, in September.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

Currently, the Khan Academy has a library of over 7,000 tutoring videos and receives up to 14 million visitors each month.</p>\n<p>Khan said he spent many afternoons tutoring his cousins and while tutoring his 12-year-old cousin Nadia he had several of what he called ‘aha moments’ that made him realize the impact he could have through education.</p>\n<p>Khan said he is proud to empower students to succeed in disciplines for which they have been told they do not have the “gene.”</p>\n<p>“There’s something very powerful here,” Khan said. “We now can tell the student, ‘Keep working on it. You haven’t mastered it yet,’ because the tools are there now.”</p>\n<p>Khan also said there is “a lot to be done” in terms of education, but he hopes to make his tools available to “level the playing field” for students who don’t have access to other resources.</p>\n<p>“The deck isn’t stacked against them as much as they think,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Hamza Bhatti said Khan’s videos helped him throughout high school in classes like calculus, physics and biology and his younger brother now uses the Academy.</p>\n<p>“It was really cool to hear his voice in person instead of a blackboard,” Bhatti said. “My little brother is in eighth grade right now, so he’s going to be involved with Khan Academy, and that’s why I wanted to come.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67608\" style=\"width: 342px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67608\" data-attachment-id=\"67608\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/creator-of-khan-speaks-about-education/salman-khan_by-alex-payne-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Salman Khan (Khan Academy)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67608\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3-682x1024.jpg?resize=332%2C499\" alt=\"Alex Payne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"332\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67608\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Payne / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Bhatti said he appreciated Khan’s description of his college experience, in which Khan recounted social and academic challenges.</p>\n<p>“For [Khan] to say that he submitted 40 [job] applications and didn’t get any of them, but then the 41st paid off, it was like the light of day, and something that I want to pass on to my little brother,” Bhatti said.</p>\n<p>Wan Pei Fung, second-year biology major and exchange student from Singapore, said she attended the event because she uses Khan’s videos both at UCSB and in Singapore.</p>\n<p>“I really used a lot of [Khan’s] videos for chemistry and physics so I wanted to come and learn more about Khan Academy,” Fung said.</p>\n<p>Fung said Khan’s statement that “anything worth doing is something you can fail at” encouraged her to take on challenges.</p>\n<p>“For me, I don’t want to do something because I know I’m not good at it, like physics and computer science,” Fung said. “But after that, I realized that I have to try, and that failing might be a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Sydni Baker said that her favorite part of Khan’s lecture was his message to students to participate in activities they enjoy.</p>\n<p>“I feel, like, validated.

about learning, the pursuit of knowledge and what it means to be a student,” Brandwein said.</p>\n<p>Khan said he hopes to continue to reach more students in hopes of giving them “agency over their

Barbara County Board of Supervisors allocated $128,000 in contingency funds last week for additional shelter services for the approximately 1,400 homeless individuals seeking refuge from El Niño rain storms.</p>\n<p>Proposed by County Supervisors Doreen Farr and Steve Lavagnino, the two-fold project allocates $91,000 for two daytime shelter locations and provides $37,000 for night warming centers to be available an additional 15 nights. The five warming centers, including the Isla Vista location at the University Methodist Church, have already been activated 27 out of the planned 50 nights across the county, compared to 13 nights this time last year.</p>\n<p>Farr said addressing the needs of the homeless residents could not be put off due to predictions of increasingly poor weather over the next several months.</p>\n<p>“People need to be cared for sooner, rather than later, so that they don’t get sick. In some cases with the homeless, they will die on the street if they’re not cared for,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office volunteer chaplain, also said the homeless are at risk in the winter weather.</p>\n<p>“We may not have snow and frostbite here, but it gets pretty close to it, and sooner or later that takes a toll,” Hedges said. “That’s why so many of the folks … died way before, some of them in their late 20s.”</p>\n<p>The warming centers, active Nov. 15 through Mar. 31, provide shelter from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. on nights when the overnight temperature drops below 35 degrees, there is a 50 percent chance of rain predicted for two consecutive nights or a 50 percent chance of temperatures less than 40 degrees for two consecutive nights. According to Farr, the day shelter program was developed to provide a companion piece to the warming centers.</p>\n<p>“That system has worked very well, but there was a concern that that wasn’t enough, that we needed something during the day,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>The day shelters will likely be located at Earl Warren Showgrounds and at Santa Maria’s Minami Center in North County. While these locations are less easily accessible than the five warming centers across the county, Farr said a form of transportation may be provided to shuttle homeless residents to the day centers.</p>\n<p>“We did work with some transit providers, like Easy Lift, to say if we’re able to get these day shelters up and running. If people need assistance in getting there … the people at the warming shelter at night when they’re released at 6 in the morning, we could provide a shuttle service from the warming center locations to the closest day center,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Junior Anguiano, Community Affairs Board hunger/houseless co-coordinator and second-year film and media studies and psychology double major, said it is important to provide transportation for the homeless.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them have everything they own on a bike, and you can’t just throw that on a bus and go downtown and have to make that trek,” Anguiano said. “There is no established shelter in I.V. other than the warming center.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said while Reverend Frank Schaefer has been very gracious to open up the University Methodist church as a warming center, the issue of shelter for the homeless individuals in I.V. is about more than just “ducking in to get a dry place to sleep.”</p>\n<p>“The solution really is finding a place, helping us find a place, agitating with us to find a place,” Hedges said. “Also, volunteering with things like Doctors Without Walls, student health outreach, SWIPES.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said he also encourages students, when they feel safe, to reach out to homeless individuals in I.V. in small ways.</p>\n<p>“If nothing else, maybe buying somebody a cup of coffee, giving them a justification for being in the Starbucks,” Hedges said. “You know, you see some guy there cold and wet, buy him a cup of coffee.”</p>\n<p>Hedges also said he wants UC Santa Barbara to “step up as a neighbor” in finding a long-term solution for housing those living on the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Long range, the University is building all kinds of stuff here … In all of that development I hope there is some provision for the poor among us,” Hedges said. “Some of the [homeless] folks that have died on the street here started out as students at UCSB … I’m not looking for anyone to come riding in with a bag full of money, but at least let’s be part of the plan together.”</p>\n<p>Anguiano also said the homeless community of I.V. is very different than that of cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco and students should take the time to hear their stories and share their own.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them come here because they want to hear what college students have to say or the things we’re thinking about,” Anguiano said. “Just talking with them … one-on-one getting to know them, like you’d get to know anyone. Just because they’re houseless doesn’t take away their humanity.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67741\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67741\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/","id":3870,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[3869,3868,3867],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
