","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The lights are off, you are tucked into bed and you are ready for it. It’s been awhile, school has been tough and work has been long — you need this. You feel your partner slipping into bed with you: he’s warm, he smells good and the sight of him pulling off his shirt is making you think something along the lines of “come to mama!” And then comes the takeoff!  </p>\n<p>After a couple minutes of trying to build yourself up by the mere power of your own mind (and let’s face it, you can only do so much), you come to the conclusion that it is just not doing it for you. He is slobbering all over your ear, his kisses are sloppy, his pubes are making you itchy, he’s pushing his uninvited penis WAY too close to your face and *insert every other weird thing done to you during sex here.* Okay, so it may not always be this awful, and his ungroomed jewels may not bother you in the slightest, but all in all, the sex is not enjoyable. One thing is for certain, and that is we should all learn to ask for what we want and how we want it during sex. Suffer no further, I have the answers to your prayers here. </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75346\" style=\"width: 1510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75346\" data-attachment-id=\"75346\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-01/a-guide-to-being-unapologetically-loud-in-bed/wednesdayhump/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wednesdayhump.jpg?fit=1500%2C1800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"wednesdayhump\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wednesdayhump.jpg?fit=208%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wednesdayhump.jpg?fit=853%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wednesdayhump.jpg?resize=888%2C1066\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1066\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75346\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wednesdayhump.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wednesdayhump.jpg?resize=208%2C250&amp;ssl=1 208w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wednesdayhump.jpg?resize=768%2C922&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wednesdayhump.jpg?resize=853%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 853w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75346\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>I have learned a thing or two throughout the years of occasionally laying like a corpse, eyes wide open and staring at the ceiling, wishing with all my might for some all-powerful deity to come tire out the guy on top of me.

You are deserving of having just as much fun, which is why you need to stop moaning unless you really mean it. Here are some of the reasons why you might feel compelled to sit pretty and wait until your lover is done, and also the reasons why your assumptions are just so, so wrong. </p>\n<p>You are afraid to hurt his feelings. Don’t be. Whether he is the guy you met a couple of minutes ago at your friend Britney’s keg party or the guy you see yourself living with, thirty kids deep into marriage, your partner is a big boy — he can take it. Some guys may occasionally be upset to learn they were not pleasing you, but most of the time they will be happy you trusted them in the first place and will be eager to do what feels good for you. Most guys probably don’t even realize that what they’re doing is not working for you, so it is up to you to change that. If he doesn’t care to please you like the sex goddess you are, maybe it’s time to find another buddy for your nightly activities. </p>\n<p>You feel guilty and even greedy asking for what you like because it makes you feel like an entitled brat. Newsflash, you are not a monster for wanting to have fun with your sexual partner. In fact, you should think yourself a better person for respecting yourself enough to speak up in the name of good sex; you have realized it is about the pleasure of both and not just the one. It’s not your fault the repetitive motion or your head banging up against the wall, or the car windshield just aren’t doing it for you. Sure, it may not always be this obvious or severe, but that doesn’t mean you are not allowed to say something about it.</p>\n<p>It feels weird to ask for sexual favors. I mean, his man parts are in your woman parts, so the worse has come to pass, what is a little “can I get it just a little bit harder,” going to do? It is understandable that sometimes it can be a little weird to ask for things that you hear in corny movies and bad porn clips. At least to me, “a little to the left and harder,” and “yeah, right there baby, don’t stop!” seldom exited my lips with much ease, especially not with a new partner. With time and practice though, you will be talking dirty like a pro.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If he doesn’t care to please you like the sex goddess you are, maybe it’s time to find another buddy for your nightly activities. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Do you like getting spanked? How about doing it in the kitchen or experimenting with props? Do you want blindfolds and restraints involved? Perhaps you like getting bite marks all over the place. If so, by all means ask for it! You might think you are weird or out of the norm for liking the kinky stuff. However, no one is completely normal in bed, which makes you making you quite average. I slept with a guy that loved being choked for gosh sake. Besides, if you want to kick things up a notch or simply want to try something new with your partner, 99 percent of the time your partner will probably be excited and eager to try that something new with you. </p>\n<p>If not for yourself, do it for your partner. You might be enjoying your carnal activities with the hottie with a one-night pass to ride the rollercoaster, but if this is a serious partner we are talking about, you might be putting your relationship at risk. There is nothing worse and more uncomfortable for both of you, than when your partner realizes you are faking it. I have been there, and it is not pretty. Not only will he probably feel hurt and embarrassed, but the trust he had with you will be broken. In the future he might find himself wondering whether he is really pleasing you or if it is all just a ruse, which may put strain on your sex life and your relationship. Being vocal is as good for your partner as it is for you.</p>\n<p>On the topic of relationships, whether he realizes it or not, not getting what you want may make you bored or even resentful in the future. You might lose hope that your partner will ever learn to please you in bed; however, that is something that needs to be addressed in the first place. You may not even notice and, before you know it, the problem will begin affecting both of you. </p>\n<p>Again, he or she may not know that you are not getting what you need, so spare yourself some trouble and regret and speak up about what gets you going before it is too late. I realize it is easy to tell yourself, “I’ll give him this one, next time I’ll tell him the way he sucks on my toes is really not doing it for me for sure.” If you make a habit of “next time” you might never escape the vicious cycle. Am I saying to instruct him on how to do everything? No, but definitely help him get there; you decide the pace you want to take. In the end, both involved parties will be happy and resent-free in no time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I feel a duty to address the young women of my generation and others, because I have listened to many-a-girlfriend’s countless complaints about horrible sex, and it is a complaint that seems to be universal</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now am I saying that guys don’t feel dissatisfied in bed from time to time or that they are all sex robots seeking only to please themselves? Far from it. In the past, I have looked down at my own partner only to realize he is watching me having all the fun with an expression of dissatisfaction, which, of course, I was quick to fix. However, I feel a duty to address the young women of my generation and others, because I have listened to many-a-girlfriend’s countless complaints about horrible sex, and it is a complaint that seems to be universal. We are sometimes taught that as women, being sexual and having preferences is just not acceptable and that we are less “ladylike” if we talk about such “tasteless” subjects. In spite of this mentality, I hope you all realize it is not a crime to respectfully ask for what you want and deny what you do not. </p>\n<p><em>At the end of the day, however, no matter your sex, sexual orientation or gender identity, everyone deserves to enjoy a healthy and pleasurable sex life.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75345\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-01/a-guide-to-being-unapologetically-loud-in-bed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75345\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-01/a-guide-to-being-unapologetically-loud-in-bed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-01/a-guide-to-being-unapologetically-loud-in-bed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-01/a-guide-to-being-unapologetically-loud-in-bed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-01/a-guide-to-being-unapologetically-loud-in-bed/","id":6289,"author":{"id":398,"name":"Scarlet Serrano"},"related":[6288,6287,6286],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":398,"name":"Scarlet Serrano","biography":"Not available","articles":[6287,6288,6289],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Sex, Love and Politics","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2017-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/political-date-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/political-date-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos finds fault with the idea that opposites attract in time when our politics are so polarized.

It was my first time going back since the election, so I was hesitant yet curious to hear how some of them felt about our country’s current state. One night over drinks, one of my good girlfriends and I were venting about our disappointment, shock and repulsion over the election results. After relieving our political frustration, we switched topics to her new boyfriend that she is absolutely smitten over. I was feeling so much joy for her as she endlessly listed his positive qualities and kind gestures when she suddenly mentioned that he was a very active supporter of Trump.</p>\n<p>I sat there, puzzled, as I tried to process this information. After everything we had just discussed, how is it possible that she could be so into someone who views life in such a different light? How could she be so invested in a relationship with someone who could have such different beliefs and values? Of course, I believe that coexistence and amiability is possible amongst those of differing political viewpoints, but love? Sex? Marriage? I mean, let’s be honest: This election was not typical. It was full of extremes, and a lot of extremes that affect women, specifically. For most people, this election wasn’t just a matter of being fiscally conservative or wanting lower taxes. Casting a vote for Donald Trump meant a lot more than that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe that coexistence and amiability is possible amongst those of differing political viewpoints, but love? Sex? Marriage?</p></blockquote>\n<p>We are living in a time of intense opposition and frustration. Ultimately, I truly do believe that all of this will lead to positive change, but right now people have to speak out. They have to be honest about what they feel and believe. Regardless of which end of the spectrum you fall on, the issues that are currently on the table are far too big to be brushed under the rug. Trying to start a relationship with someone who you can’t discuss these intense topics with isn’t going to lead to any sort of steady foundation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>People often say that opposites attract. But really, how accurate is that? Sure, we like people that are different. Sometimes it’s nice and necessary to have others balance us out and open our eyes to differing thoughts and views. But when it comes to our core values, they can’t be too far off. Having such fundamental differences is extremely difficult to get past and will most likely result in someone changing or caving in order to make the relationship work. Having a real relationship with someone means that you plan on growing with them. It means that you plan on becoming better as individuals together. I don’t see how that can be possible between two people who have completely different ideas about what constitutes growth and improvement.</p>\n<p>One of the most prominent topics being debated at the moment is that of a woman’s right to have control over her body and health care. Call me crazy, but it seems pretty absurd to be sleeping with someone who holds the opposite view of you on an issue as heavy as this. In my opinion, regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, the person that you are having sex with must share the same opinion. It doesn’t matter if it’s a casual hookup or a serious, long-term relationship.</p>\n<p>All in all, having sex can lead to consequences, one of them being unwanted pregnancy. Even when you’re careful and responsible, accidents can happen. If it does, it’s pertinent that both parties be at least somewhat on the same page. While I personally believe that the ultimate choice is that of the females, knowing where your partner stands on the issue can save a lot grief and pain.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In my opinion, regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, the person that you are having sex with must share the same opinion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are woman who is pro-life, and could never bring yourself to make the decision to terminate a pregnancy, then the guy that you’re sleeping with should share the same mindset. If you are a woman who believes that she has the option to do what she pleases with her body, then you probably shouldn’t be sleeping with someone who voted against you having that choice. How can you be comfortable sharing your body with someone who doesn’t believe in the rights that you have to it? It’s a dynamic that is far too complicated and serious to risk.</p>\n<p>While it is true that people can change one another and open our minds to new ways of thought and belief, trying to force change upon the person you desire isn’t going to result in happiness for either of you. Having a relationship that thrives, challenges and inspires you requires that your fundamental values and beliefs be in alignment. Being able to connect on not only a physical and emotional level, but also on one of intellect will, without a doubt, result in the strongest and most rewarding of bonds. So don’t let yourself settle. Don’t allow yourself to be with someone who makes you feel inferior. We are facing tumultuous times that will be made much easier with the support and affirmation of those we hold closest.</p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos hopes you and yours are on the same page politically. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75194\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75194\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-25/sex-love-and-politics/","id":6286,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6285,6284,6283],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Long-distance, Quicky, Busy Sex:  Finding Time for Intimacy in a Hectic, Long-Distance Relationship","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2017-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-15-at-12.04.22-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-15-at-12.04.22-PM.png?resize=608%2C546&ssl=1","description":"Scarlet Serrano explores the options for getting some action with your significant other while in a long distance relationship.

For some couples, it’s like a temporary little vacation and maybe even gives room for some “me-time” on both sides. However, for some, it can feel a little like trying to extinguish a fire by dousing it in gasoline, all while throwing grenades and heaps of dynamite at it from afar. Setting the distance aside, you’re fighting against all sorts of other natural elements resulting from the miles in between; you can no longer meet each other at that cute little coffee shop you both loved lounging at every Sunday, and you can’t just drive over and have a lazy Netflix night at his or her place.</p>\n<p>In spite of what seems to be a radical shift in your relationship, however, perhaps one of the hardest things — no pun intended — of being so far apart is the lack of intimacy. Since having easy access to sex is one of the main greatest reasons of being in a relationship, the inability to touch your partner may be half the reason you might find the process so painful. As if it weren’t hard enough to be separated by hundreds of miles, working around school, work and other personal obstacles can be difficult and unpredictable. Having been in such situations before, I’ve learned that even with all of the crazy shenanigans in between, you can always make time for a little fun in bed.</p>\n<p>Fitting in time for sex in a long-distance relationship can sometimes feel like a game of pick and choose. Do you go out and share the new places you’ve found with your significant other or do you stay in and spend the little time you have down in the sheets? For a lot of you, it might seem only too obvious to think, “Why not just do both?” But the reality is that sometimes that is not an option. Most of the time, there is still homework to do, laundry to wash, work to finish, things to take care of, which must get done, even if it means having to make your man/woman tag along. It is surprising to learn that sometimes it just takes a little adjusting to steal some extra time!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>Fitting in time for sex in a long-distance relationship can sometimes feel like a game of pick and choose. Do you go out and share the new places you’ve found with your significant other or do you stay in and spend the little time you have down in the sheets?</p></blockquote>\n<p>For example, before going to bed with your loved one, set your alarm for a decent hour instead of waking up whenever your body feels like it. Am I saying wake up at an ungodly hour? No, just don’t let yourself wake up at 12 p.m. because it’s the weekend and you love sleeping in more than life itself, however tempting it may be. Another way to make every second last is to do chores together. If you haven’t got a single pair of undies left, bringing your honey along with you and having them finish up some of their chores along with you will work wonders. Do homework together at the same time instead of separately sitting down while the other does who knows what. Sometimes all it takes is planning a little ahead of time.</p>\n<p>Having the advantage of planning ahead will also help you score some time for some late-night fun. Before your partner even arrives, or before you arrive with them, make sure to get as many things out of the way as you possibly can beforehand. Sometimes this can easily translate into hours of extra time with your special someone. We have a habit of underestimating how much time we spend on little things, like some homework here and car wash there, but things build up. Not only do these things rob you of your precious time, but they can also be a burden on the quality of time you have.</p>\n<p>Not having done what you had to do is probably going to be in the back of your mind most of the time you get to spend with your partner. This will not only make your free time less enjoyable, but your partner will notice and pick up on the stress and join in having a less than good time with you. Although it can sometimes be impossible to get everything done — sometimes there definitely seems to be more than there should be — make sure you are able to tune it out in order to enjoy your time together. Be in the moment together and don’t let all the noise ruin the fun!</p>\n<p>Though it’s not as great as playing naked fort in bed, taking a shower together is an awesome way to set aside time for some intimacy. I don’t mean have sex in the shower, though if you’re able to, go for it; the secret to that still remains a mystery to me. However, just getting to touch your partner’s body and kiss is enough to release the “love hormone,” oxytocin. This magical neurotransmitter not only helps couples bond, but it reduces cortisol, the stress producing hormone! Also, getting to have this time to yourselves will not only reduce anxieties of wondering whether the attraction is still there, but it will give you a break from your distance-induced celibacy.</p>\n<p>Just because you are apart does not mean you can’t have any sort of sexuality with your man/woman. Though not equivalent to phone sex, it’s always nice to remind your partner that they are still desired. Something as simple as commenting on their awesome legs, or reminding them how much you miss smacking “that butt,” will remind them you do still have a sex life, even if it hasn’t been too active. Likewise, they will feel more comfortable and make you feel just as wanted in no time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The sad truth is that sometime there is no time for sex. And not only is there no time for sex that one weekend, but also the next weekend, and when there are long periods of separation in between, that can translate to going on weeks, even months at a time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Be affectionate when you are out and about. Holding hands, kissing and simple touching goes a long way. I don’t mean go out in the middle of the park and openly grope your partner in front of a bunch of unsuspecting watchers, but simply caressing each other and embracing your partner can make a world of a difference. Though this may not seem very intimate, it will help you feel more connected and will help satisfy that need for contact until the next time you get to do the more fun things.</p>\n<p>The sad truth is that sometime there is no time for sex. And not only is there no time for sex that one weekend, but also the next weekend, and when there are long periods of separation in between, that can translate to going on weeks, even months at a time. The painful part of this isn’t the plain fact that you are not getting any action, but the fact that stress and tension arises from that lack of intimacy between your partner and yourself. Does he/she not like me anymore? Is something wrong? Are we breaking up? Did I hurt his feelings when I joked about his shoes? It must be the haircut, these bangs suck! All sorts of insanity clouds your judgment and you may find yourself and your partner being vigilant about every little anomaly, everything that could or could not be a sign for trouble.</p>\n<p>No, you are not turning into one of those married couples that you hear about in movies in which the two haven’t slept together in years. Things simply change, and one must adapt to trust that things are not bad, just different. Every now and then, you just have to accept that even if there is no time for sex, there is still time to be together. It is not easy to go weeks and months without touching your partner; however, keep in mind that things will not always be as hectic.</p>\n<p><em>Scarlet Serrano believes being patient is sometimes the

Every day one is bombarded with opinions of what our bodies should look like, from the mouths of magazines, friends and, sadly, even family members. Yes, the subject has been beaten to death — to a complete pulp — however, we still don’t seem to get it. No matter our physique, we still tend to want to be something different, but what happens when the time comes to bare it all as it is? Nothing else seems to cause as much anxiety as worrying about what you look like when it comes down to get busy with your significant other. You want to enjoy yourself, but instead you find yourself preoccupied with making sure you look like as close to a porn star as possible.</p>\n<p>The fact is, we can’t all have triple Ds or, in my case, even measly Bs or be skinny, curvy or thick all at the same time. We can’t all magically develop Kardashian asses — no matter how many squats we put in — and we don’t have to in order to enjoy sex.</p>\n<p>Many times I found myself wondering what made me look good when putting on my birthday suit, heck, even better! If I put my leg over here, if I twist there, will that show too much stomach? I need to sit up straight or else he’ll see too much. Enough is enough, people! Is sex not supposed to be about physical pleasure anyway? Turn off your mind and R-E-L-A-X! Indulge in your senses. Be in the moment. Clear your mind, and enjoy it without letting your preoccupations and worries get in the way. Again, you are doing something in the name of physical pleasure, so get out of your head — unless, of course, it helps you get there — and get it on already!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One way to not let your insecurities stop you from enjoying your sex life is to stop comparing your body to everyone around you. Seriously, sit down and reason with yourself, and you will see that this makes absolutely no sense. You are not that person, and so, obviously, you do not look like them. I’m not declaring a war on being fit or demeaning trying to look your best, far from it, but the only person you can be better than is yourself. Stop exhausting all your time trying to become your idealized girl/guy next door and try to see yourself as a separate, and just as good, human being.</p>\n<p>Another helpful way to get out of your mind and into your body is to really set the mood. I know, been there done that, and it has been repeated more than the whole meteor and dinosaurs on Earth story, but it does its fair share of damage. Play steamy music, darken the room, light a couple of candles. I know, it sounds cliché and mushy, but it works. It might not for everyone, but I guarantee most of you will be happy you tried it. Either way, just make sure to put the candles out when you people are done getting weird.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Make the room a little chilly so pressing against your partner will be a must to keep warm, and I don’t mean cold enough to rip through the sheets with your nipples, but you get the point.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Going hand-in-hand with setting the mood, start prepping for the deed way, way beforehand. Have a romantic night, go to dinner, take a shower together and watch a corny movie. Little things like this will help you bond with your man/woman and put together the mindset of all things lovey dovey, therefore pushing away all those little voices of judgment in your head. This will also get you in the mood and help you gain trust and intimacy with your partner in crime.</p>\n<p>Speaking of focusing on your physical senses, make it a playground for taste, feel, smell and touch in the bedroom, as well as any other freaky stuff you, you little sexy beast, you, may be into. Light an aromatic candle and use lotion to make each other smell awesome; use lubes and oils to massage each other before getting down to it. Maybe you have a favorite pair of sheets that are extra soft/fresh? Make the room a little chilly so pressing against your partner will be a must to keep warm, and I don’t mean cold enough to rip through the sheets with your nipples, but you get the point.</p>\n<p>Really feel your partner’s skin against yours, hold each other close enough to feel every inch of their body. Smell is a huge way to get you going, so ask your man/woman to put on some cologne, perfume or musky lotion. You’ll be devouring each other without a second, self-deprecating, judgmental thought in no time.</p>\n<p>Spoil yourself a little on the inside to try and feel good on the outside. Relieving stress and making yourself feel good is a perfect way to start feeling less insecure. Something as simple as winding down and taking an aromatic bath or even doing your nails with a different color will help beautify your image of yourself. Buy a hydrating mask and treat your skin to some softness. Treating your body and mind will work in harmony and help get out of your head.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The best way to make peace with what you’re working with is to accept it, truly accept it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In spite of the fun of accessorizing sexy time with different things, one of the biggest things you can do for your sex life is to build trust with your partner. I am not insinuating that your boyfriend or girlfriend is a douche because you don’t feel like JLO when baring it all, but trusting your partner will play a key role in the way you feel when you’re au naturel around them. Fight your insecurities, and trust that at the end of the day your S.O. chose you. No one is holding him or her at gun point in order to get them into bed with you. Do you see any restraints? Threats being whispered into your boyfriend’s or girlfriend’s ear from under the bed? No, so just relax, and work together to build trust amongst each other.</p>\n<p>Many of these practices may seem superficial, and in part they are, without partaking in a key little something else. Truth is, you need to face your insecurities head on. Stop thinking that once you change this or tweak that you will be happy with yourself, because this is so very false. The best way to make peace with what you’re working with is to accept it, truly accept it. Simply ignoring it will not make it go away. Speaking from experience, even when ridding yourself of those certain attributes of yours, they will continue to lurk and haunt you unless you come to terms with them.</p>\n<p>One must really do a combination of things to truly enjoy sex. Sadly, sometimes we have trouble taking our own advice. It takes time, but a consciousness of avoiding certain blunders is necessary to stop what you are doing wrong. Knowing what not to do is the first step to eliminating the problem. Granted, simply distracting yourself with fancy lube and manly cologne to ignore the problem isn’t going to cut it. Once you have covered trusting your partner and relieving yourself from goddess or godlike expectations of physique, you will truly have fun in bed. Everything else after that is an accessory to make sex more fun.</p>\n<p><em>Scarlet Serrano wants you to relax, and enjoy the ride.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76087\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/why-the-bedroom-is-no-place-for-pornstars/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76087\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/why-the-bedroom-is-no-place-for-pornstars/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/why-the-bedroom-is-no-place-for-pornstars/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/why-the-bedroom-is-no-place-for-pornstars/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-01/why-the-bedroom-is-no-place-for-pornstars/","id":6288,"author":{"id":398,"name":"Scarlet Serrano"},"related":[6287,6286,6285],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
