Then, your group’s favorite song comes on, and just as T-Swift is going on about how “miserable and magical” you’re feeling (in the best way of course), you turn to your best friend and realize how hot she looks in that crop top and short shorts.  You’re singing, you’re grinding and out of nowhere you’re making out … What happens next is history — well, her-story really — because you let curiosity get the best of you and quite literally let the cat out of its tight, zippered bag.</p>\n<p>Let’s be honest (or should I say lesbihonest?): Sometimes, you just want to experiment outside of your sexual norms. As a gay man, there are plenty of times I like to hook up with girls just for fun, and while most of these experiences are purely erotic, devoid of any romance whatsoever, they still happen and I enjoy every second of them. With that said, I’m not the type to cuddle a girl. To be honest, I don’t even hold hands with girls and not because I don’t like them or don’t think that they’re pretty, but really because I reserve romance for men — probably because I’m gay. Still, I like to venture out and try new things, and, to be totally honest with you, I’d call you a liar if you told me that you never at least thought about doing the same.</p>\n<p>The really interesting thing about experimenting with other genders is that many of us have thought about the idea of doing it, but never really the act of doing it. What I’ve found in that past is that our brains separate eroticism and intimacy pretty well … because, let’s be real, it’s not like you want to date last Saturday’s dime piece or even your fuckbuddy. Sexual chemistry and romantic chemistry are two pretty different, albeit intertwined, concepts. I sleep with a lot of different guys, for instance, but I don’t have romantic interest in most of them, and the same goes for when I’m experimenting with girls. With that said, the first step in turning your experimental thoughts into sexual actions is to stop and realize that your sexual attraction to someone and your romantic attraction to someone are totally different from each other.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Once you’ve started to realize that intimacy and sex are totally separate concepts, you need to ask yourself: Do I want to do this?  Experimentation isn’t for everyone, and I’m not going to be the first to tell you that if you’re not comfortable breaking through your sexual boundaries just yet, you don’t have to. Still, it can be really fun to start slow, and most girls will agree that tipsy makeout sessions with your best friends can actually be really fun. And men, don’t be afraid to break social norms either, because, I’m sorry, but grabbing No. 49’s ass after the football game isn’t really that far from kissing; rather, it’s just one of many socially acceptable forms of male-on-male eroticism.</p>\n<p>With that said, I’m also here to tell you that finding members of “the other gender” (the one you don’t normally find sexually appealing) attractive doesn’t have to dictate your sexuality as a whole. I think it’s funny when straight guys ask me, “Well, how do you know if you’re gay if you haven’t tried girls yet?” Why? Because I have slept with girls and guess what, the V just doesn’t really appeal to me like the D. So on the flip-side, why have I slept with girls if I know that I’m gay? Because it’s fun. Like, really fun … it’s totally a spur-of-the-moment type thing that happens just as randomly as group sex or BDSM, and doesn’t make me straight or bi or pan or anything for that matter. Only you can define your sexuality — nobody else. And to all you straight folk out there, I’m here to tell you that flipping to the other side for a night won’t make you gay. If it did, let’s be real, I’d have a lot more gay friends than I do right now.</p>\n<p>Going back to that mention of group sex though, it’s actually a great way to initiate experimentation for those of you who are afraid to try it one-on-one. The first time I ever slept with a girl was during a threesome with another guy and, technically, that was a form of experimentation whether he wants to admit it or not — but trust me, he admits it. With that said, go ahead and ask your girlfriend for the kind of threesome she’s always dreamed of having, because guess what? Group sex not only offers you a more acceptable form of experimentation, but further, it might open you up to attractions and urges you never felt compelled or secure enough to explore in the past.</p>\n<p>All in all, experimentation can be a really fun way to spice up your sex life and explore your own interests. While lots of people are afraid of the idea of experimentation, realize that almost everyone I know has had some sort of “out-of-the norm” sexual fantasy that they couldn’t really explain, and that it’s okay for you to have them, too. In essence, sexuality isn’t black and white at all. In fact, it’s a rainbow of colors that blur together and coexist in absolute awesomeness that knows no boundaries and has no limits. In closing, let me leave you with a fun little motto I’ve recently decided to live by: Fuck the rules, because fucking rules.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni is happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

A blink of an eye and a college acceptance later, the simple times of high school begin to seem so distant that they almost resemble a distant childhood memory. Between midterms, balancing surfing schedules, and constantly wondering how to impress Chancellor Yang, it seems impossible to find enough time to sleep. Now imagine throwing a relationship — let alone commitment — into the mix. On the one hand, it can be rewarding and freeing to launch into your first adult relationship. But dating in college can also be, for lack of a better phrase, fucked up.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86442\" style=\"width: 407px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86442\" data-attachment-id=\"86442\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/how-my-parents-divorce-affects-my-love-life/dndivorce-png-tinna-lam/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dndivorce.png-tinna-lam-.png?fit=2180%2C1878&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2180,1878\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dndivorce.png tinna lam\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dndivorce.png-tinna-lam-.png?fit=250%2C215&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dndivorce.png-tinna-lam-.png?fit=888%2C765&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86442\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dndivorce.png-tinna-lam--250x215.png?resize=397%2C341\" alt=\"\" width=\"397\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dndivorce.png-tinna-lam-.png?resize=250%2C215&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dndivorce.png-tinna-lam-.png?resize=768%2C662&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dndivorce.png-tinna-lam-.png?resize=1024%2C882&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dndivorce.png-tinna-lam-.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86442\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was romantically involved in the typical teenage relationship a few times in high school. As each met their demise, I began to uncover exactly what factors into a relationship. Is it culture? Could it be morality or overall attitude? For many, it seems that there is a large correlation between romance and background. When it comes to my own, the defining factor is the fact that I grew up amidst my parents’ ugly divorce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My first view of dating and relationships was somewhat cynical. At age eight, I was convinced that true love was a hoax and that devotion to another person was a waste of time. It took years to begin to trust flirtatious men, and the only way I could do so was by distancing myself from what my parents had been telling, and inadvertently showing, me for years. It was a big adjustment for me to ask my first boyfriend to drop me off at “Mom’s place” or “Dad’s.” In my home state of Washington, only </span><a href=\"https://www.mollybkenny.com/library/washington-state-divorce-rate-washington-divorce-statistics.cfm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.6 out of every 1,000 </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">families divorced in 2014, and that statistic often haunted me when it came to making friends or important first impressions. There were times when I considered hiding my family’s situation, claiming my dad was always working or my mom was just around the corner having wine with a neighbor. The gist is that my parents ignore each other’s existence, and it used to be humiliating. When I first entered the dating scene, I participated in all the girly gossip of high school sophomores. Unlike many of my peers, I had no “meet the parents” family dinners, where my partner would nervously tug at his tie or call my parents “sir” and “ma’am.” I still often question exactly what childhood experiences or family stature best prepare someone for a healthy, prosperous relationship. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout my first quarter and a half of college, this question has been increasingly heightened. Dating in college is already a mess. It’s just one more bowling pin to juggle, and I turn to my parents quite often as I slide my way into adulthood. I used to find it impossible to know when to consider their relationship guidance, my fear of ending up a divorcee getting in the way. Sometimes asking for advice even felt like I was squeezing lime juice into the wound of my parents’ failed marriage. I was scared of commitment because I never had a model that demonstrated how it was done or no one ever showed me how it was achieved. However, due to this dilemma, I have taught myself the most important key to dating. Because I have the opportunity to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use my parents as a cookie cutter example of a flawlessly operating relationship, I can carefully select what to value or leave behind when they offer me suggestions. I now choose what lessons they teach me about dating to internalize and to take to heart, and in turn, I am beginning to learn who I am as a girlfriend by my own standards. This was my “eureka” moment in that what once gave me grief and embarrassment now gives me an exceptional amount of freedom.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes asking for advice even felt like I was squeezing lime juice into the wound of my parents’ failed marriage.

It is crucial to keep in mind that, no matter your demographics, college relationships can be tricky to balance. Remembering your roots at certain times will weigh you down but there are also moments when you can redefine them. Taking a look at the mistakes made by those who raised you can make a huge difference in how you choose to formulate your identity, as my parents’ errors have helped shape who I will be in the future. It’s okay to leave a part of where you come from in the rearview mirror when looking to understand who you, as an individual, are beginning to be.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Rollins would like to emphasize that you may have to become less like your parents to become more you. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c31a4351f865a0226af40b21e9559068?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c31a4351f865a0226af40b21e9559068?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sophia-rollins/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sophia Rollins</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sophia Rollins is an Opinion staff writer from rainy Seattle, Washington.

What do I do? </em><br>\nYou are certainly not alone in this conundrum; this is a tale as old as Sam hirself. The thing you really need to ponder is whether or not she is someone you want to have a future with. If her company for nine months of the year is worth the sacrifice of loneliness for the rest, then stay with her. If you think you’re going to want to meet up with your random ex from high school who went away and got really hot, then go ahead and say adiós to the lady here. It really comes down to a question of intent: Are you in it for the sex or the company? If you answer sex, break it off. Company, try to keep it up.</p>\n<p><em>My boyfriend will not stop staring me directly in the eyes while we have sex. I think he thinks it’s romantic, but it’s really just creeping me out. How can I get him to stop without hurting his feelings?</em><br>\nPepper spray him directly in the corneas, he won’t stare at anything for weeks. Sam hopes that you know that is a joke because that’s three to five years in jail, otherwise … most definitely assault. Really, you can try closing your eyes out of “sheer ecstasy” instead of looking back at him. Or you could suggest that you turn all the lights off so he can stare away at the black abyss while you’re none the wiser. Yet another option, hug him close so he couldn’t look at you even if he wanted to. Otherwise, try to think about why that makes you so uncomfortable to 1) be stared at 2) to confront him about it. If you have trouble being intimate with him, maybe it’s time to get up and roll out. </p>\n<p><em>I think my girlfriend read some story about how guys like to have a finger put up their butts when they’re getting head … First of all, wrong. Second of all, she’s really self-conscious so is there some clever way I can get her to stop trying to do that? </em><br>\nClench your cheeks! That will make it very difficult for her to place anything up there against your will. Either that or you can take the logical approach and tell her that the finger method does not work for you. If you really don’t want to talk to her and her fingers are determined to break your clench, you can always try to sit down when she wants to go down on you, thus blocking your butthole entirely.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>So this girl I’ve been hooking up with has a giant Ryan Gosling poster hanging over her bed and every time we go at it I feel him looking directly into my soul and judging my less-than-perfect hair. I’m almost certain she would pick the poster over me, so I can’t ask her to take it down. Do you know of any sex moves that might endanger said poster?</em><br>\nThe “Freddie Mercury” is a classically dangerous sex position for any and all posters, Ryan Gosling ones included. This position necessitates that the giver be backed up against the wall in a celebratory single “fist pump” position, while the receiver bends over in front, either bent over to the floor or grabbing a chair of some sort. This will give you the perfect time to secretly reach back with your fist-pumping hand and rip off Gosling’s beautifully judgmental face. Chances are she will be extremely sad, thus ruining the moment, but your mission will be complete. Bear in mind, however, that there are approximately one billion posters / pictures of Ryan Gosling that can be hung upon walls of all sorts. Your victory will be short-lived, my friend. Short-lived, indeed.</p>\n<p><em>I wanna liven things up in the bedroom. What’s the best toy I can get for a reasonable price? </em><br>\nFor a college student tryna ball on a budget, Sam recommends a vibrating cock ring. They’re cheap (although, go too cheap and the battery might die on you mid-hump) and it will add a bang to both of your … bangs. If you’re really, really on a budget, pull a <em>50 Shades</em> and head to Home Depot … you’ll be surprised by how much spicier things will get when a piece of rope is involved.</p>\n<p><em>Everyone keeps telling me I can’t graduate without having sex on the beach, but that sounds miserable! And the alternative, the library, sounds just as bad. Am I being a wuss or is everyone else just hyping this up because it sounds exciting?</em><br>\nFirst of all, it is a known fact that the UCSB deans will simply refuse to give you your diploma if you haven’t had sex in one of these two places. Trust me, it’s in the UCSB handbook. But checking this off your bucket list shouldn’t feel like a chore; both the beach and the library can be bliss. The key to sex on the beach is simply to bring a towel; sans towel, you’ll get cold sand and tar in places where you ain’t never had tar before. Then again, the best way to take off tar is baby oil … which could make for a kinky round two when you get back to your place. For the library, since we don’t have a classic shady “stacks,” time is going to be your biggest enemy. It all hinges on you wearing quickie-specific clothing; unfortunately, guys on guys are going to have the hardest time with this, but it’s possible. Of course, you could always cheat and use the listening rooms in the music library … still counts in Sam’s book. So make sure you hit the library before you slip on that cap and gown (which, by the way, serves as a perfect uniform for an easy-access, pre-ceremony quickie … you’re welcome). </p>\n<p><em>Last weekend I saw my first uncircumcised penis. It kind of freaked me out at first, so I was just wondering if this is like a common thing or if he was just an anomaly.</em><br>\nIn the ’70s, two-thirds of boys born in the U.S. were circumcised, but the rate has been steadily dropping since then, now hovering at around 57 percent. All I’m saying is that you’re more likely than not going to encounter more uncircumcised penises in the future, so calm down. Go with what your momma taught you and don’t judge a book by its cover. The only time when you’ll notice a difference is during a blowjob, but relax; just pull the foreskin back if you don’t want to deal with it, no big deal. Even better, use your hands to incorporate that hood.</p>\n<p><em>I really like this guy I’ve been dating, but he keeps tearing my neck up with hickeys every time we hook up and I can’t wear scarves in this heat! He says it turns him on, but I’m the one who has to deal with the consequences. How do I go about this? </em><br>\nYou could be a champ and just get your makeup game strong (guys can wear foundation too, yo), but Sam understands that this can get exhausting. Just use your words; compromise by telling him that you love when he kisses your neck, but softer kisses actually turn you on more. If he still won’t learn, just return the favor until he understands what it’s like to constantly look like an extra on the “Walking Dead.”<br>\n<em>Sam the Oracle stays clenched. Always.</em></p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, May 21, 2014 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.
