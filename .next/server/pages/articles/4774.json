The eviction notices gave the tenants, all low-income long-term residents, 60 days to vacate the apartments, according to the Isla Vista Tenants Union.<em> Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) announced the beginning of a campaign on Tuesday to provide required financial assistance to five households allegedly evicted from Abrego Villas on 6754 and 6764 Abrego Rd. in Isla Vista this past October.</p>\n<p>Following the evictions, which were issued without justification by Abrego Apartments, LLC, under Van Nuys property owner Majestic Asset Management, LLC, the units in Abrego Villas were renovated and the rent was allegedly increased by over 50 percent, which made the units too expensive for former tenants to re-enter. These cases are the latest in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/tenants-removed-from-isla-vista-apartment-building-in-mass-eviction/\">a series of past evictions</a>, and under Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444, individuals evicted from households on County land are entitled to relocation benefits in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>In August, six households were allegedly served eviction notices by their landlord at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Rd., one in one building and five in the other. According to the IVTU, the eviction notices gave the tenants — all of whom were low-income, long-term residents, and many of whom were Latino families — 60 days to vacate the apartments.</p>\n<p>The tenants then contacted IVTU and an Associated Students Legal Resource Center and an IVTU-provided lawyer who then informed the tenants of the Ordinance 4444 violation potentially made by Majestic Asset Management, LLC, entitling them to benefits under county law. When the tenants presented their case to the property owner, Majestic Asset Management, LLC refused to grant them benefits and the tenants challenged the landowner over the amount in small claims court, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 11.</p>\n<p>According to the Advising Attorney at the A.S. Legal Resource Center Robin Unander, Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444 does not take effect in every situation.</p>\n<p>“The interesting thing about the ordinance is that it applies under very limited circumstances,” Unander said. “So what we’ve seen, because these property owners are not coming forward when they decide to make these changes is, they don’t tell the residents, ‘Oh guess what we’re gonna do all this, but we’re gonna offer you some relocation benefits.’”</p>\n<blockquote><p>This does affect the whole community. It’s not just these families, it’s the entire community. Many of them work full-time job and have kids in schools. Some of them had to move kids to new schools and find new jobs. — IVTU President Andrey Bogdanov</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unander also said each evicted household is entitled to up to $10,500 in benefits, paid by Majestic Asset Management, LLC, under Ordinance 4444.</p>\n<p>“We’ve made that known to Majestic and they said, ‘We’ll give them a $1,000 and a security deposit.’” Unander said. “So when we weren’t able to get past that in November or December when it stalled, we filed small claims.”</p>\n<p>However, Majestic Asset Management, LLC has taken the position that the Ordinance 4444 does not apply to them, Unander said.</p>\n<p>“Their position is based on the fact that, before the tenants vacated, the tenants were given 60 days notice,” Unander said, “and before the 60 days were up, before the tenants actually vacated, Majestic was made aware by me that this situation might exist.”</p>\n<p>According to IVTU President and third-year econometrics major Andrey Bogdanov, the property owners attempted to remedy the situation by canceling some evictions, but the effort came too late as the tenants had secured replacement housing by the time the offer was made.</p>\n<p>“Even if they were allowed to stay they couldn’t technically move back in because they can’t have two leases at the same time,” Bogdanov said, “or even if they could move back in, even if that was legally possible, they wouldn’t be able to afford the rent.”</p>\n<p>Representatives for Majestic Asset Management, LLC could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>According to Unander, Majestic Asset Management, LLC evicted a select number of their tenants and made sure to do no renovations that required permits so as to not trigger the benefits enacted by Ordinance 4444. She also said that once the County became aware of what Majestic Asset Management, LLC was doing, the county ordered the company to cease until they acquired permits. However, the tenants had already signed permanent contracts to live elsewhere when the company offered them the chance to come back.</p>\n<p>“That’s one of the things that takes them out of the benefits,” Unander said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the housing market in I.V. is significantly saturated, allowing unexpected evictions to substantially alter the livelihoods of some residents, especially if they are low-income or have children, Bogdanov said.</p>\n<p>“This does affect the whole community. It’s not just these families, it’s the entire community,” Bogdanov said. “Many of them work full-time job and have kids in schools. Some of them had to move kids to new schools and find new jobs.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov also said the eviction timing has put a toll on tenants who have consequently had to struggle to find housing.</p>\n<p>“Because they weren’t evicted during the leasing season, in October it’s very difficult to find quality housing in,” Bogdanov said. “Six tenants may not seem like a large number, but since 2002 over 300 households have been evicted.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60000\" style=\"width: 725px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60000\" data-attachment-id=\"60000\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/ivtu-fights-for-evicted-tenants/tenants_lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421917242\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tenants_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11-1024x682.jpg?resize=715%2C476\" alt=\"The Isla Vista Tenants Union has recently undertaken a campaign to offer financial support to tenants that were evicted without notice last August.

I mean, these folks were evicted, in fact, as far back as October.

Clinic for the weekly I.V. self-governance meeting organized by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office.</p>\n<p>This week, attendees discussed whether to create a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) instead of or in addition to a Community Services District (CSD). Discussions at previous self-governance meetings had been primarily focused on forming a CSD, but it is still unclear exactly what form of self-governance will be proposed by Williams’ Assembly Bill 3, which aims to create self-government in I.V. in order to provide infrastructure and services to I.V. residents. The group also discussed efforts to understand the demographics and needs of the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, a member of  Williams’ district office staff, said the creation of a CSD requires more discussion time because it is more complicated than the creation of a MAC.</p>\n<p>“We’re talking about the CSD option so in-depth because it’s so complicated and covers so many areas,” Elliott said. “We’re going to talk about Municipal Advisor Councils today, which is an alternative to the CSD. I.V. had one in the 70’s and 80’s that was dissolved, so we’re talking about maybe bringing that back.”</p>\n<p>According to Elliott, cityhood discussions cannot begin until organizers have a better idea of I.V.’s potential financial situation.</p>\n<p>“The cityhood plan we can’t really talk about until we find out if it’s financially feasible,” Elliott said. “The CSD is so complicated and has so many layers we’ve been focusing our meetings on that.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and local business owner Jay Freeman said it was not made clear at the meeting whether an I.V. CSD would be feasible.</p>\n<p>“It’s not actually clear that a CSD itself is financially feasible,” Freeman said. “I only say that because I take some issue with the notion that cityhood cannot be discussed because we don’t know whether it’s financially feasible but there’s a base assumption that a CSD can be discussed.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar however said stakeholders should not be content to create only a MAC.</p>\n<p>“I think that the MAC is a great thing for us to be able to utilize, due to the fact that a CSD would take about 16 months for it to be formed,” Minoiefar said. “However, I wouldn’t want the momentum, the political feasibility that we have right now to be spent only on a MAC. This is our chance to do something very big, like institute a very strong institution that can be here for decades to come because it’s self-sustaining.”</p>\n<p>Longtime resident Sue Dixon said she is concerned that there would not be adequate funding and support with a MAC.</p>\n<p>“It had been more than 10 years since we had a disaster and support for Isla Vista just died as part of that cycle. We get another disaster and people start pouring resources back and we’ve seen this happen,” Dixon said. “This is why I think we should have permanent funding for a MAC. I think a MAC is a great idea. I would like to see permanent funding because I don’t trust the county to keep going with it.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said the both MAC and the CSD could be created.</p>\n<p>“I don’t view these two things as mutually exclusive and I hope no one in this room does,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District board member Pegeen Soutar said a MAC was established in 1972 because of the unrest in I.V. and founded many of the current institutions in I.V., including IVRPD and IVFP.</p>\n<p>“It was actually pretty huge at the time,” Soutar said. “I.V. Parks and Rec actually came out of a combination of the Community Council and the MAC. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol, the idea of the Foot Patrol, came out of the MAC. The Isla Vista Health Clinic came out of the MAC. These are all institutions that still exist that came from this beginning seed of people coming together.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Trustee Jonathan Abboud said he is working to put out a survey of I.V. residents on how they would like potential tax dollars be spent in I.V., as well as the possibility of performing a census in I.V.</p>\n<p>“People don’t know the exact technicalities, but they understand the taxes pretty well,” Abboud said. “They knew that they needed more money if they wanted these services. Parking and lighting was overwhelmingly what people would put their money towards. We were thinking of doing a census that would be going door to door and asking ‘How many people live in your apartment?’”</p>\n<p>Spatial Arts Professor Kim Yasuda said she would be willing to survey university faculty living in the faculty housing units adjacent to I.V.</p>\n<p>“Has anyone gone over to faculty housing and canvased them?” Yasuda said. “That’s a tax-paying base. I think we could get permission to get on the list serve or something … That’s 65 units of probably 200 people.”</p>\n<p>The stakeholders created a preliminary list of broad, amendable goals for a CSD to add to the AB 3 language so that the bill can continue forward in the legislature. The list includes the creation of a MAC, a tenant mediation program, a parking program and the building of community facilities. The tentative list of goals will be discussed further at next week’s meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61054\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61054\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/meeting-discusses-municipal-advisory-council/","id":4771,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4770,4769,4768],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up Jan. 16-18","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) officers responded to numerous calls in I.V. last weekend, citing under-aged students for possession of cocaine, taking custody of three legally registered firearms for s...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) officers responded to numerous calls in I.V. last weekend, citing under-aged students for possession of cocaine, taking custody of three legally registered firearms for safekeeping and answering calls related to battery, public intoxication, driving under the influence and prowling.</p>\n<p>Units were dispatched to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road Monday night to respond to a noise complaint made by student Michael B regarding his roommate. Seconds after units cleared the call, the roommate flagged down the IVFP officers in the street and stated that Michael B was brandishing a knife. After investigation, Michael B was arrested on a citizen’s arrest for brandishing a weapon and battery.</p>\n<p>During the course of the investigation, officers also learned Michael B had two legally registered rifles, a modified AK-47 and a Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun in the house, which Michael B agreed to turn over to the officers for safekeeping. In addition, the roommate agreed to turn over his gas pistol to the officers for safekeeping.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, the AK-47 had been professionally modified to fit legal California firearm standards and not function as an assault rifle, which has been prohibited in California since the 1989 approval of the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing is that it fires single rounds at a time instead of automatic,” Plastino said. “It still fires a 7.62mm round, which is still the standard size round for an AK-47.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, because Michael B did not use the firearms in any act of violence nor give any indication that he would, he was not legally required to relinquish possession of his guns, although Plastino believes Michael B was correct to do so.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, the guy made a good decision,” Plastino said. “He made a thoughtful decision in allowing us to take his weapons from him because he didn’t have to. He committed a sort of violent crime, brandishing a knife, so he needs to cool off and calm down before we’ll return his weapons to him.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, law enforcement officers pulled over a vehicle with four juveniles and one adult inside during a routine traffic stop because the headlights were turned off while the car was in motion. The driver, a juvenile, was under the influence of alcohol, while two more passengers were intoxicated with alcohol and marijuana with the other two passengers in possession of cocaine. All subjects were cited and their parents called to pick them up. The legal adult, 18-year-old Michael Davis, was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail for possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p>Later on Friday night, at approximately 11:00 p.m., a female was approached and verbally assaulted by her ex-boyfriend, Carrington Cox, outside of 7-11. When the victim’s current boyfriend stepped in to intervene, a shoving match ensued, at which point Cox struck the victim’s current boyfriend in the face with a skateboard. Cox then broke free of the scuffle and ran towards his ex-girlfriend, stomping on her left leg and fleeing south on El Embarcadero. The female victim sustained a fractured tibia and extensive knee injuries.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, the Delta Gamma sorority requested extra patrol in light of the social media shooting rumors, during which officers noticed Santa Barbara City College student Joshua McKenzie Smith at an upstairs, outside door of the sorority house. Plastino said Smith tried the door to see if it would open and claimed to be trying to find the residence of his friend, Tom. He was then arrested for public intoxication and prowling.</p>\n<p>IVFP officers also noted that on Sunday there were more crowds out than a usual due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday, during which there were miscellaneous alcohol and noise ordinance citations issued.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59924\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59924\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/weekend-wrap-up-jan-16-18/","id":4772,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4771,4770,4769],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Landlord Will Soon Nix Ambassador Program","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Isla Vista rental group St. George & Associates will get rid of its Ambassador Program in favor of stricter guidelines","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>Isla Vista rental group St. George &amp; Associates will get rid of its Ambassador Program in favor of stricter guidelines</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_61115\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61115\" data-attachment-id=\"61115\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/the-campus-880-apartment-complex-on-camino-del-sur-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/St.-George-Associates_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?fit=4928%2C3264&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4928,3264\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"13\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"The Campus 880 apartment complex on Camino Del Sur.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423728880\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"The Campus 880 apartment complex on Camino Del Sur.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Campus 880/St. George\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/St.-George-Associates_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/St.-George-Associates_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61115\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/St.-George-Associates_Sam-Aragon-11-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"Campus 880 apartments, the original site for the Ambassador Program, will soon be host to a new scholarship program.

St. George &amp; Associates plans to terminate the Ambassador Program starting next year and may convert it to a scholarship program where students will no longer be able to choose which service events to participate in.</p>\n<p>St. George &amp; Associates owner Ed St. George said he is ending the current Ambassador Program to prevent further dispute with tenants over the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to fight with people anymore,” St. George said. “I’m terminating what I think was probably one of the most innovative community programs that you could put in a college community.”</p>\n<p>In order to prevent further complications, St. George said he plans to change the Ambassador Program to a scholarship program where students no longer choose their own community service activities.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to do a scholarship program next year and I’m not letting kids pick the events anymore — it’s not going to happen,” St. George said. “They broke my heart this year.”</p>\n<p>Ambassador Program director Mark Capritto said residents avoided the proper types of events for the program, which asked tenants to perform community service.<br>\n“[The residents] didn’t do what they were told,” Capritto said. “You can’t just pick and choose what you want to do — you do the program.”</p>\n<p>According to Capritto, St. George &amp; Associates would often turn down the reward for tenants who did activities like donating blood or working on campus, which he felt did not directly help the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“Some people were saying, ‘Well I gave blood. That should help somebody in Isla Vista.’ We said, ‘No you can’t count that.’ People started doing all these things that they felt were contributing, and — bless their hearts — that’s what they do,” Capritto said. “Certainly donating blood is a worthy prospect, but it didn’t meet the needs of those people who were actually paying to have it done.”</p>\n<p>Capritto said he supports the idea of converting the Ambassador Program into a scholarship program, but maintained he is opposed to terminating the program altogether.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really want to walk away from this,” Capritto said. “Ed [St. George] asked me a year ago to come in and look after it, and I said I would.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Legal Resource Center attorney Robin Unander said tenants asked for attorney service as early as October when disputes arose between residents and St. George &amp; Associates over how many hours were required for each community service event and what kinds of service activities qualified under the program.</p>\n<p>“There was such a firestorm of frustration that some tenants had to lawyer up and try to see what they could do to try and get [St. George &amp; Associates] to comply,” Unander said. “One student lawyered up last October.”</p>\n<p>According to Unander, St. George &amp; Associates has made it difficult for students to adhere to the community service requirement of the program. She said the property management company kept “moving the carrot,” and students found themselves having to complete additional requirements to receive their reward.</p>\n<p>“There’s so much of a shit-storm going on over there with students who rightfully complied with their contractual obligations,” Unander said. “They jumped through the hoops that they were told they had to jump through, but the hoops kept moving.”</p>\n<p>According to Unander, St. George &amp; Associates changed the qualifications to avoid paying for the 20 percent difference created by the rent discounts, which she said cost the company more expenses than it anticipated.</p>\n<p>“I think the Ambassador Program ended up being more expensive than what they originally estimated,” Unander said. “They probably had more tenants qualify for it than what they thought would, so then that became an expensive experiment.”</p>\n<p>According to Unander, Capritto has no legal authority to change the language of the program because the program’s specifications are bound within the lease contract.</p>\n<p>“The Ambassador Program is incorporated into the lease contract, so they have to honor it just like they have to honor every single clause contained within that contract,” Unander said. “The sad part is that whoever this Mark Capritto person is, he’s lacking the knowledge about contract law.”</p>\n<p>Capritto said the attorneys who argue that St. George &amp; Associates cannot change the language of the Ambassador Program hold a different view on the function of the rental organization.</p>\n<p>“I’m not an attorney, but what I can tell you is that is coming from an attorney who’s protecting their client,” Capritto said. “I know where the attorneys are coming from, but that’s their interpretation of what an organization does.”</p>\n<p>According to Capritto, St. George &amp; Associates is allowed to alter the Ambassador Program at any time it wants as part of its rights as an organization.<br>\n“We’re an organization,” Capritto said. “We reserve the right to restructure ourselves.”</p>\n<p>A Campus 880 resident and second-year student who spoke on condition of anonymity said the Ambassador Program required she complete 16 hours of community service per year upon signing her lease, but that number has now increased to 64 hours per year. She said she fears she may not obtain the minimum amount of hours because the number has increased and St. George &amp; Associates limited what events she could participate in.</p>\n<p>“They didn’t let us choose our own volunteer work in Isla Vista,” the tenant said in an email. “It makes it more difficult to accumulate hours, and we can’t pursue volunteer work in the areas of our choosing, like we used to be able to.”</p>\n<p>The tenant also said St. George &amp; Associates was imbalanced by giving credit to residents who did not properly complete their community service.</p>\n<p>“Some students who didn’t complete the volunteer hours simply got their hours signed off by a Campus 880 representative, and they were told they could ‘make up the hours later,’” the tenant said in an email. “This is unfair as this option wasn’t available to all students.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the February 19, 2015 print version of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-19/isla-vista-landlord-will-soon-nix-ambassador-program-isla-vista-rental-group-to-cancel-ambassador-program/","id":4773,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4772,4771,4770],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
