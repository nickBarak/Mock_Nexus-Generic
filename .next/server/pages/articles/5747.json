Spoilers Ahead! </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Horse Girl,” a new Netflix 2020 drama, is something very different and unexpected. The two-hour-long drama keeps you actively engaged in the story as well as keeps you curious as to how the film will eventually end. Actress Alison Brie, known for her roles in productions like “BoJack Horseman” and “Community,” co-wrote the screenplay alongside director Jeff Baena and starred in the film as its lead character Sarah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah, a young woman whose lucid dreams become intensely vivid, struggles in differentiating these fantasies from reality. Brie does a remarkable job of surfacing many different emotions as well as evoking several emotions from the viewer with her portrayal of Sarah. You feel her discomfort, stress and unease in every scene as almost as if you were actually there. “Horse Girl” is undoubtedly a psychedelic trip of a movie, often leaving the viewer to question what is actually happening. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film provides you with many plausible explanations for Sarah’s behavior including cloning,  alien abduction, borderline schizophrenia and a history of mental illness within her family. From the very beginning, you can easily tell that Sarah doesn’t blend well with others in her life — simply put, she just doesn’t fit in. For the most part, Sarah believes that she is a clone of her grandmother, constantly comparing their uncanny resemblances. Sarah, already being an awkward character from the jump, only then begins to suffer from events that resemble schizophrenic episodes. But it’s more than that; there’s a mysterious and unexplained layer roaming over the plot throughout the film. Only at the end does everything get pieced together, but you are still left without the satisfaction that anything truly got resolved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way in which this film’s sequence of events is carried out is very well done. Its depiction of time is one of constant bending and overlapping, forcing you to reevaluate your original thoughts and recall scenes that occurred in the film’s beginning. In short, every scene within “Horse Girl” is imperative to its central plot. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92816\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1814919151\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92815\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92816\" data-attachment-id=\"92816\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/the-daily-caller/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?fit=1200%2C516&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,516\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Daily Caller\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?fit=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?fit=888%2C382&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92816\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=888%2C382\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=1024%2C440&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=768%2C330&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92816\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The Daily Caller</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that being said, there were some plot holes as well as certain depictions that seemed a bit excessive and exaggerated. Right as the film hits its climax, Sarah goes on a rather pointless venture dressed as a “pink ninja” — this scene seems as if it was created just to emphasize a trippy and kaleidoscopic aesthetic and ruins the initial effect of using all these distracting scenes in the first place. Then, there’s the mystery of her mother’s death and Sarah’s relationship with her stepfather. Both storylines are introduced, but neither are ever taken into more depth. The film implies that her past has a heavy and murky influence on both her personality and current ticks. Sadly, the viewer is only given a very minimal outlook on that part of Sarah’s life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another plot hole within the film would be that of the DNA test that Sarah takes about halfway through the film. The test was suggested to her by her coworker who had taken the test herself to discover more about her genetics. Sarah never receives the results for this test and instead just assumes that they are inconclusive. The DNA test, as well as a traumatic horse riding accident, are both ignored for the majority of the film. We are introduced to a childhood friend of Sarah’s that was immensely affected by the incident, but we are never truly given a reason to how this is relevant to the central plot — it seems as if it was put in just to fill time. Sarah’s obsession with horses and her discontinuation of riding them is also never fully addressed or explained. Her stepfather is decently wealthy, so even the sale of her horse doesn’t add up. These little intricacies distract from the main storyline and poorly develop Sarah’s overall character.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the film’s soundtrack, it was performed and composed by Josiah Steinbrick and Jeremy Zuckerman; this will be both composers’ first major accredited work in film. The music fits well with the theme of the film and highlights the anxiety-inducing and dramatic scenes very well. Its use of synth and tranquil sounds resembling wind chimes synchronizes nicely with the overall tone of the scenes. If you were simply to listen to the original soundtrack alone, it would be very similar to one that is played in the background at a spa. </span></p>\n<p><b>Overall Rating:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 8/10 — Aside from the abundant release of dramas premiering on Netflix recently, this film does take a different and interesting approach, compiled of many puzzling and somewhat cringy scenes. Nonetheless, I would suggest that people still see this film. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92815\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92815\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/","id":5747,"author":{"id":769,"name":"Arielle Bitton"},"related":[5746,5745,5744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":769,"name":"Arielle Bitton","biography":"Not available","articles":[5742,5746,5747],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Didn’t Make it to SBIFF 2020?

Along with more serious themes like family values, self-acceptance and growth, “A Bump Along The Way” is also filled with extremely comedic dialogue, albeit it can be difficult to understand everything that’s said due to the thickness of the Irish accents.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the film screening, star actress Bronagh Gallagher appeared onstage to thank everyone for attending the event and to wrap up the evening.

Zellweger’s performance earned her a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination for her role as Judy Garland, an American actress/singer/dancer who achieved stardom due to her warmth, spirit and iconic status within the LGBTQ+ community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interviewed by Hollywood Reporter’s columnist Scott Feinberg, Zellweger detailed how she has changed over the years, proclaiming “the journey is what matters the most,” not the success of the film but the creative experience. Zellweger’s contribution to cinema includes more than 35 films, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the popular “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bridget Jones’s Diary”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> franchise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane Warren, songwriter and friend of Zellweger, presented the award and predicted on the red carpet that Zellweger will take home a much-deserved Oscar. When Warren presented the award, Zellweger thanked Warren for “inspiring her to tap into her imagination” and thanked the community for allowing her to be a part of the “cinema-loving community” of Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Outstanding Performers of the Year Award</b></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92527\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"37723475\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92521\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92527\" data-attachment-id=\"92527\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-02/didnt-make-it-to-sbiff-2020-heres-everything-you-missed/sbiff_adam-driver_siavash-ghadiri_online_11-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?fit=2000%2C1162&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1162\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF_Adam Driver_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?fit=888%2C516&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92527\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?resize=888%2C516\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?resize=768%2C446&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?resize=1536%2C892&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SBIFF_Adam-Driver_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_11.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For their roles in “Marriage Story,” actors Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were presented with the Outstanding Performers of the Year Award at SBIFF 2020.

Other notable people to have received this award include Denzel Washington, Clint Eastwood, George Clooney and Cate Blanchett, to name a few.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92522\" style=\"width: 1595px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brad-Pitt-SBIFF_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1539400802\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92521\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92522\" data-attachment-id=\"92522\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-02/didnt-make-it-to-sbiff-2020-heres-everything-you-missed/brad-pitt-sbiff_siavash-ghadiri_online_14-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brad-Pitt-SBIFF_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?fit=1585%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1585,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Brad Pitt SBIFF_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_14\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brad-Pitt-SBIFF_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?fit=198%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brad-Pitt-SBIFF_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?fit=812%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92522\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brad-Pitt-SBIFF_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?resize=888%2C1121\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1121\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brad-Pitt-SBIFF_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?w=1585&amp;ssl=1 1585w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brad-Pitt-SBIFF_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?resize=198%2C250&amp;ssl=1 198w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brad-Pitt-SBIFF_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?resize=812%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 812w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brad-Pitt-SBIFF_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?resize=768%2C969&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Brad-Pitt-SBIFF_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_14.jpg?resize=1217%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92522\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leonard Maltin conducted the on-stage interview with Pitt, occasionally taking breaks to showcase clips from several of Pitt’s major films. In a nearly two-hour-long discussion, fans got to hear firsthand how Pitt began his acting career, how he prepares for certain roles and what it’s like getting to work off-screen in his production company, Plan B. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, “Fight Club” director David Fincher presented Pitt with his Maltin Modern Master Award and closed the night on a positive note. “I feel so fortunate for all the amazing people that I’ve been able to work with that have taught me so much, that have touched my life,” Pitt said. “I feel blessed.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To see photos of Brad Pitt at SBIFF 2020, click</span></i><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-26/in-photos-brad-pitt-at-sbiff-2020/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> here.</span></i></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Outstanding Directors</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, Jan. 23, “Parasite” director Bong Joon Ho was awarded the Outstanding Director of the Year Award. This critically acclaimed, stomach-turning, dark comedy masterpiece has already earned Bong various other awards including Best Motion Picture in a Foreign Language at the Golden Globes and a Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Bong is also currently nominated for four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the first-ever Korean director to be nominated for an Oscar, Bong is certainly paving the way for future Korean (and people-of-color) filmmakers. “Parasite”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marks Bong’s seventh feature film as a director and is the reason why he is this year’s outstanding director. With the help of his interpreter, Sharon Choi, Bong took the audience through each of his films and revealed eccentric facts about his life, creative process and behind-the-scenes work.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Women’s Panel</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel included Rosana Sullivan, Mayes C. Rubeo, Julia Reichert, Arianne Phillips, Anne Morgan, Aneta Hickinbotham, Regina Graves, Sarah Finn and Bonnie Arnold </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> all renowned in their respective fields for their leadership, dedication to their craft, attention to detail and stunning success. Whether they were costume designers, directors, producers, hairstylists or more, each woman brought her own raw experience and perspective to the table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moderator Madelyn Hammond, with lively and hilarious commentary of her own, questioned the women for about 15 minutes each, in which they shared stories of their experiences working in film over the past year.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Closing Night</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Closing Night Film of SBIFF, the spotlight was put on Santa Barbara in showcasing an array of short documentaries made by local filmmakers. This selection of films covered a broad range of topics from backpackers trekking the Los Padres National Forest to a local guitarist who shares his music in public areas throughout downtown Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These Santa Barbara Documentary Shorts included: “10 Miles Out,” “Cabrillo Village,” “Carrizo Plain: A Sense of Place,” “Hannah’s Ride, “The Last Ride” and “State Street Serenade.”</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

cameras with the capability to create and print high-quality photos much quicker than using the medium of film, one can see why film photography has lost its mainstream popularity. I grew up with the mindset that film photography was an ancient art form, something that I never pictured myself trying firsthand. Little did I know film photography would become one of my biggest passions.</p>\n<p>When I was in middle school, I participated in an acting program on the weekends, where I happened to meet my best friend. After a few years of learning the Strasberg method, we both decided we needed a change. At the time, Instagram had just come out and we were heavily interested in photoshoots and experimenting with photos so we decided to look for some photography classes. My friend discovered a place called the International Center of Photography, which offered what happened to be analog classes. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed but I decided to give it a shot.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92059\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_8553.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"684393170\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92056\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92059\" data-attachment-id=\"92059\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-17/an-ode-to-the-art-of-photography-capturing-life-on-film/img_8553/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_8553.jpg?fit=750%2C1131&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,1131\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_8553\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_8553.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_8553.jpg?fit=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92059\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_8553.jpg?resize=750%2C1131\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"1131\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_8553.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_8553.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_8553.jpg?resize=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 679w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92059\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>On the first day of class, I was handed my first film camera and the teachers started explaining all sorts of things like aperture, shutter speeds and film winding. Guided by a dim yellow light, they led us into a darkroom and demonstrated the process of printing with chemicals like developer and stop wash. It was an overwhelmingly tedious process. Printing one photo could take up to a month because you have to shoot, develop the film, make a contact sheet, pick one photo, split-filter test strips to find the perfect combination of settings, go through the routine of moving the print through all the chemicals and then put it in a water wash for 20 minutes. I kept thinking what a waste of time it all was and how much easier it would be to just use a digital camera. Still, because it was a 10-week course commitment, I stuck with it, and it wasn’t long before I fell in love with the process of printing film photographs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I find so much happiness in film photography because it has taught me to be patient; printing photos yourself instead of going to a shop involves the full darkroom printing experience. It can be a frustrating process to spend hours in the darkroom trying to find the perfect setting combination for one photograph. Eventually, the frustrations dissolve into patience which allows the work process to become a form of meditation. For me, the darkroom is a place to disconnect and tune into the present moment. When I place a photo into the developer and watch it float, my inner voice goes mute. Memories of the past and dreams of the future disappear. I feel present and connected to the now. With the rhythm of the printing process accompanied only by the sounds of the chemicals rushing through the trays, the ticking of the clock and the pops from the timer button, the feeling of being in the darkroom is comforting and calming.</p>\n<p>Beyond the technical process of printing, film photos bring you so much closer to the moment captured on the negative. When you print a photo, you create a moment in time — something tangible. It is so special to watch an image trickle down the paper while it floats in developer because you are able to remember a happy moment in your life while watching your creative masterpiece come to life right in front of you.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92058\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9214.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1877298377\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92056\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92058\" data-attachment-id=\"92058\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-17/an-ode-to-the-art-of-photography-capturing-life-on-film/img_9214/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9214.jpeg?fit=750%2C1131&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,1131\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9214\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9214.jpeg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9214.jpeg?fit=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92058\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9214.jpeg?resize=750%2C1131\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"1131\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9214.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9214.jpeg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_9214.jpeg?resize=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 679w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92058\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Getting a film camera, buying film, investing in darkroom material and even finding a darkroom is a big time and money investment. So, in the case that this world of film photography isn’t accessible, I think that a monthly disposable camera is worth the investment. An important idea behind film photography is that the photos will always be raw moments in time. We can’t edit how the photo looks on a negative and this makes a captured moment feel so much more real. I took a few disposable cameras with me to Europe over the summer and I captured some of my favorite moments. You snap photos so quickly and casually that you forget what photos you took and getting the photos back from the developing shop is so exciting. When I got my photos back, I could easily tell they were the most imperfect photos – my face was cut off in almost all of my attempted selfies – but looking back at these random times on my trip I couldn’t help but smile at the photos I forgot I took and how genuinely real they were.</p>\n<p>You can most definitely get photos that you took on your phone or digital camera printed, but the film process is just an undeniably different and more special experience. It’s always a surprise! Analog photography is slowly becoming more trendy recently, but I hope that this can inspire more people to pick up a disposable or traditional film camera to capture life on film.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Downey’s time as Tony Stark, over a decade long, has yet to be beaten by the numerous other characters he has portrayed. I had wondered where Downey would go after leaving a multi-billion dollar franchise; never would I have guessed that the next character he would portray would be that of Dr. Dolittle. His new film, “Dolittle,” contains an all-star cast, including Selena Gomez, Antonio Banderas, Tom Holland, Emma Thompson and many more.</p>\n<p>While Eddie Murphy’s take on the role is seen as a “classic,” at least through the eyes of a child, Downey’s take is very different — the entire story and its characters have no relation to Murphy’s 1998 “Dr. Dolittle.” The plot of the newest rendition consists of Dr. Dolittle living in solitude with his many exotic animals as he grieves the loss of his wife. He is then visited by attendants of Queen Victoria who seek Dolittle’s help in retrieving a cure for her. The action-packed film, with its both humorous and sentimental dialogue, primes it to be an enjoyable watch for all ages. With that being said, it does not exceed any more depth than that of a plain, generic family film.</p>\n<p>The special effects were positively breathtaking, with every scene showcasing an abundance of vibrant colors. Though the scenes were stunning, they were often messy. The transitions between locations make your head want to spin, and they cram so many different obstacles in various locations that the development is completely lost.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As for Downey’s acting, his accent was different, and his overall portrayal was fun. Downey’s accent is not characteristic of a common British accent, but instead takes more of an eccentric approach. Halfway through the movie, you begin to realize why Downey doesn’t speak in the trailer — his accent is distracting, outrageous, and in other words, overdone. Playing such a serious and dramatic character for so many years, I can see why Downey agreed to join a project so light. Downey is a great actor and this role does not diminish his talent, but it also does not challenge him.</p>\n<p>Stephen Gaghan directed “Dolittle,” which is quite a surprise considering that his past films consist of drama and crime, surely not that of CGI’d talking animals. Gaghan’s shots were very predictable and rather cliche in trying to draw out emotion from the audience. Gaghan’s jump to fantasy was a bit of a stretch, and he is much better suited within the drama and crime realm.</p>\n<p>The music was scored by Danny Elfman, the same man who composed the music for films such as “Beetlejuice,” “Good Will Hunting,” the “Men in Black” franchise, Tim Burton’s “Corpse Bride” and the “Fifty Shades of Grey” franchise, just to name a few. The music for this film was objectively the best part of it. With such big movies already on Elfman’s roster, this comes as no surprise. The grand emotional strides of the strings and the suspenseful beats sweep you off your feet and wrap you in sweet and dramatic emotions.</p>\n<p>Overall, a 6.5/10 rating, this movie is not something that anyone above the age of nine should be running to the theaters to see. This is simply another film looking for a profit, bringing nothing special or surprising to the table.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that “Dolittle” was a Disney film. “Dolittle” is a Universal Pictures film. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92575\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/in-review-dolittle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92575\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/in-review-dolittle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/in-review-dolittle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/in-review-dolittle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/in-review-dolittle/","id":5746,"author":{"id":769,"name":"Arielle Bitton"},"related":[5745,5744,5743],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
