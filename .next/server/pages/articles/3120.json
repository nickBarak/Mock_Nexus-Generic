Elections Committee’s allegations that members of the party furnished alcohol to minors during Spring Elections.</p>\n<p>Four unelected Democratic Process Party candidates were sworn in at last Wednesday’s Legislative Council meeting to replace four elected Open People’s Party representatives, who were given the option to either resign or be disqualified from the 2011-2012 council. Four current council members, OPP off-campus representatives Danielle Foster, Reena Fram and Drey Liautaud and OPP Representative-at-Large Nathan Walter have been given the ultimatum to either resign from office or serve their terms without honoraria.</p>\n<p>Despite reports from other campus publications, the individuals have not been charged with soliciting votes in exchange for alcohol.</p>\n<p>According to OPP member and A.S. President Harrison Weber, A.S. Judicial Council can either approve Elections Committee’s recommendations or take the case to a trial. Unless Judicial Council agrees to take the case, Weber said its specifics must remain confidential.</p>\n<p>“Technically, according to the process, this is not public until Judicial Council decides to hear the case,” Weber said. “Whether or not I agree with the process, I have to defer to the wisdom of students past who constructed these policies.”</p>\n<p>During public forum at yesterday’s legislative council meeting, third-year environmental studies major Marjan Riazi called for the four remaining accused council members to step down and demanded that A.S. Elections Committee minutes be made public. The committee did not respond to the incident harshly enough, Riazi said.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s an issue that any of the people that were charged were sworn in because it perpetuates a system that undermines democracy,” Riazi said. “Executives are in charge of the party and should be held more accountable for the party’s actions.”</p>\n<p>Riazi said executive officers who ran as OPP candidates should be held accountable for the accusations regardless.</p>\n<p>“I know that you know exactly what’s going on in your party and if you’re going to run the school, you better know what’s going on in your party,” Riazi said. “I want those people to be held accountable and if any of those executive officers were involved, they should step down or be disqualified.”</p>\n<p>However, Weber said he had no knowledge of the alleged actions until after the complaint was filed and cannot answer for the actions of an entire party.</p>\n<p>“To my knowledge, executives cannot physically be everywhere at one time,” Weber said. “At the end of the day, people are adults and they make their own decisions.”</p>\n<p>Former DPP Off-Campus Representative Tiffany Mayville said allowing the four accused representatives to remain on the council without receiving honoraria is not an appropriate punishment.</p>\n<p>“Honoraria is what keeps [council members] accountable,” Mayville said. “If you don’t get honoraria, it’s hard to stay accountable because there is less of a sense of motivation. Where does the incentive come from?”</p>\n<p>Vice-Chair of Committee on Committees Kellie Hartl said Elections Committee told her she would have to serve six hours of community service or be forced to resign. However, Hartl said she was not directly involved in OPP campaigning since she holds an appointed, not elected, position.</p>\n<p>“The claims that are being made against me are unfair,” Hartl said. “I’ve never run for office; I’m in an appointed position.”</p>\n<p>Elections Committee charged Hartl with involvement in the incident through her supposed status as a party liaison to OPP. According to the Article 14 of the A.S. Legal Code, party liaisons are individuals involved with the party who may or may not be candidates. The code requires that these individuals sign a promissory note agreeing that they will not violate A.S. Legal Code or local, state or federal law — a form Hartl said she never signed.</p>\n<p>Disqualified OPP Representative-at-Large Kelly Gandee, who garnered the fourth most votes of any 2011-2012 Legislative Council representative, said the Elections Committee has handled the investigation poorly.</p>\n<p>“I would like to have seen a more organized form of questioning,” Gandee said. “I felt attacked during the sentencing meeting and I felt like I was being pressured to resign without factual evidence.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Dariush Banihashemi said during last night’s Legislative council meeting that it is important for A.S. members to act as role models for other students and silence student publications.</p>\n<p>“There are many things that haven’t been brought up and this is a bad road to go down,” Banihashemi said. “A.S. council members, it is your duty to set an example around campus and to not give quotes to the Nexus.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40228\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40228\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-26/elections-investigation-denies-student-appeal/","id":3120,"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke"},"related":[3119,3118,3117],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke","biography":"Not available","articles":[3005,3075,3120,3123,3154,3482],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Bike Safety Week Holds Workshop, Surveys on Campus Bicycle Paths","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The A.S.

A.S. Bike Committee will be holding bicycle safety-related events throughout the week.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The A.S. Bike Committee is hosting Bike Safety Week from now until Friday, encouraging students to practice caution while riding through the sometimes-risky bike paths on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee will be tabling at the Arbor all week as well as passing out bike lights and surveys for students to improve their knowledge of bike safety. On Friday, the committee will hold a bike fix-it workshop with a mechanic from the A.S. Bike Shop, allowing local cyclists to learn repair skills and other useful biking knowledge.</p>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee works all year to improve the biking climate of UCSB, with current plans to launch renovations to the bike racks at the Music Building, Humanities and Social Sciences Building and the University Center, in addition to a long-term plan to implement a new roundabout path near the tunnel located by the Recreation Center.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair Mac Kennedy, maintaining the quality of the bike culture at UCSB — which is ranked second only to Stanford as the most ‘bike-friendly’ university nationwide — is a top priority for students.</p>\n<p>“Bike culture is, in my opinion, one of the integral parts of the UCSB student experience,” Kennedy said. “Currently, UCSB is ranked as the second-most bike-friendly university … and we think we can be the best.”</p>\n<p>Bike Committee Chair Emily Littleworth said although she does not believe the biking climate at UCSB is particularly dangerous, it can be daunting for incoming students.</p>\n<p>“If you haven’t biked at UCSB, and you come here for the first time, and you see all the students, it can be overwhelming,” Littleworth said. “I think it takes some practice learning how to ride on the bike paths, learning regular traffic laws that people should abide to.”</p>\n<p>Littleworth said Bike Committee aims to reduce the danger by both improving cycling infrastructure and educating the community on safe biking tips.</p>\n<p>“A.S. Bike Committee is basically devoted to improving the bicycle system on campus at UCSB,” Littleworth said. “We do things ranging from basic improvements on bike paths, to putting in new racks, to putting in bike pumps around campus.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said he hopes to reach out to a larger number of students in the future, as a means of expanding and strengthening the committee.</p>\n<p>“One thing I’m working on for next year is trying to get more general members involved,” Kennedy said. “Because I think we need to democratize the whole process and expand the committee.”</p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 29th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/bike-safety-week-holds-workshop-surveys-on-campus-bicycle-paths/","id":3117,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3116,3115,3114],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Kennedy, a second-year political science major, who served as an On-campus Senator until his resignation in January, is an independent candidate.</p>\n<p>Foronda said she aims to use her student body government experience to engage and empower students if elected.</p>\n<p>“I have been involved with Associated Students since my first year,” Foronda said. “I am here today not only to run as AS president, but to represent you as a student body and the student voices that have otherwise been silenced.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he would continue to make real changes on campus as A.S. President in addition to the reforms he has already implemented as RHA President.</p>\n<p>“I love UCSB. Since the first day I stepped on this campus I fell in love with this campus,” Abboud said. “I have implemented real changes on this campus … [like] take out boxes in the dining commons. The Office of the President will allow me to implement even more direct change to this campus”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said substantive reform is necessary to make the association more fiscally efficiently and criticized A.S.’s excessive spending of student’s money on honoraria — particularly on salaries for Executive candidates.</p>\n<p>“I’m running because I’m passionate about making this campus a better place for all students,” Kennedy said. “There needs to be several structural reforms in A.S. Currently, tens of thousands of dollars aren’t going back to the students, and are being pocketed by A.S. executives.”</p>\n<p>Foronda focused on the rising cost of tuition as the chief monetary concern for students, and said it is crucial to encourage students to participate in rallies, lobby legislators and generally voice concerns about the issue.</p>\n<p>“Tuition has risen over 300 percent in the last 10 years,” Foronda said. “Student voices have not been heard … I will be there, and I have been there … representing student voices.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, his goal is to continue keeping students constantly involved in A.S.</p>\n<p>“We can’t get caught up in the jargon,” Abboud said. “As RHA president, and as A.S. senator … I’ve done a really good job connecting with students. A.S. was created for and by the students and we have the right to keep A.S. … related to the students.”</p>\n<p>Addressing the subject of student apathy, Kennedy said the fault lies not with the general student population, but with their student government representatives who have failed to successfully engage them.</p>\n<p>“Disconnect is a huge problem between A.S. and the student body,” Kennedy said. “Students have not been engaged at all whatsoever in A.S. …where is the outreach? Where is the engagement? … I hope that in the future as I have done to continue the work in engaging students … making sure students are aware that they have agency, that they have power.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1172887416\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50825\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50819\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/calpirg-protests-obamas-potential-student-loan-interest-rate-hike/debate_filephoto/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPod touch\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1365682595\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"3.3\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Debate_FilePhoto\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50819\" alt=\"Debate_FilePhoto\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Debate_FilePhoto.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>DAILY NEXUS FILE PHOTO</h6>\n<h6>On Wednesday night, A.S.

Womyn’s Commission’s annual runway show will take place at the Corwin Pavilion this evening, as part of the group’s ongoing efforts to challenge societal beauty norms and represent the vast diversity of the campus.</p>\n<p>The ‘I Am Beautiful’ Runway Show, which will be held at 5:30 p.m., will include live student-run performances of spoken word, in addition to a runway show and other acts open to student participation. The runway aspect of the event aims to shine light on body image topics that individuals in contemporary society oftentimes struggle with. Students can volunteer to participate in the runway to share their input on body image issues or to provide their own personal testimony. A.S. Womyn’s Commission hosts several events each year, all of which deal with various issues affecting women both on campus and in local communities.</p>\n<p>Kristina Didero, Womyn’s Commisson member and third-year sociology major, said the event will replicate mainstream runway shows but will include other aspects intended to make participants feel more comfortable.</p>\n<p>“It will be made to be as much like a real fashion show — where the model will have their picture taken at the end of the catwalk,” Didero said in an email. “Models are allowed to walk with other people as well, so those who don’t want to walk alone can still feel more comfortable participating in that portion of the event.”</p>\n<p>Popular modern media frequently emphasizes body image standards to an extent that has caused many to become “nit-picky” and “obsessive” with their own bodies, according to Didero, who said these individuals sometimes said never reach total satisfaction with their appearances. Didero said such an unhealthy dynamic should change, as it sets norms that make individuals practice excessive self-criticism.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the phrase ‘great body’ is never associated with anything other than the ideal 36-24-36 type for females,” Didero said in an email. “I personally feel like I don’t go a day without hearing multiple comments from various people criticizing their image and essentially indulging in negative self-talk. The conversation needs to change in terms of this topic, and the focus on appearance should be diminished.”</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Co-Chair Mariam Agazaryan said the ‘I Am Beautiful’ Runway Show will highlight the problems with standardized beauty, while drawing focus to the many different ways one can be beautiful. Agazaryan said discussion of this topic is especially crucial since the vast number of unhealthy living conditions, such as eating disorders, occur as a result of unfair beauty standards.</p>\n<p>“There is no one ideal type of beauty and what the media constantly displays isn’t the only kind of beauty,” Agazaryan said in an email. “We put on this event every year to raise awareness about beauty stigmas and eating disorders that arise as a result of this. Everyone is beautiful. We want to use the show to allow everyone the opportunity to be models to demonstrate what they believe is beauty.”</p>\n<p>Agazaryan said she believes that society’s definition of beauty is flawed as a result of fashion magazines and advertisements that promote unrealistic, and sometimes unhealthy, ideals of beauty.</p>\n<p>“Those ‘beautiful’ people we see are artificially created through Photoshop and digital media,” Agazaryan said in a email. “They don’t exist. I think that beauty is skin deep.
