We played bad,” said Head Coach Andrew Checketts. “We had that game in our hands.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 31-13-1 on the season and 9-6 in the Big West Conference, which puts them at third in the conference. The Gauchos are now on a two-game losing streak and have lost three of their last four matches. The CSUB Roadrunners improve to 12-34 on the season and have won their last three games, their longest streak of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For Santa Barbara, this loss is a bad one. Not only was it a loss to a much inferior opponent, but it came at a time when the team is struggling to keep the national spotlight as it has dropped out of the D1 Baseball Top 25 National Rankings.</p>\n<p>The loss is also made worse by the team’s lackluster performance. UCSB blew a 3-0 lead heading into the eighth inning and a 4-3 lead going into the final frame.</p>\n<p>Not only that but the Gauchos left 11 runners on base including six in scoring position. They only mustered in one run in the second and third innings combined after having the bases loaded in both of those frames.</p>\n<p>Combine that with two errors that proved to be costly, base-running mistakes and simple misplays of the baseball and one can easily see that UCSB deserved to lose Tuesday’s game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were coming off a tough series against UC Davis, but were back at home where they had won 17 straight games and boasted a 21-1 record, so it was not a far-fetched idea to think they could win this game easily.</p>\n<p>UCSB started the scoring in the third inning thanks to redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno’s sac-fly RBI that scored redshirt junior Andrew Calica to take a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>In the fourth inning, Santa Barbara again added one run to extend its lead to 2-0 after redshirt freshman catcher Thomas Rowan hit an RBI single.</p>\n<p>In the fifth frame, sophomore first baseman Austin Bush hit his sixth home run of the season, a team high, which scored one run to make the score 3-0 after five.</p>\n<p>The combination of pitchers James Carter (a redshirt junior), Kevin Chandler (a freshman) and Justin Kelly (a redshirt senior) was phenomenal for the first seven innings as the three combined to allow just three hits, two walks, four strikeouts and, most importantly, no runs.</p>\n<p>In the top of the eighth inning, left-handed pitcher Kyle Hatton was called on to continue the momentum. However, the moment seemed too much for the freshman as he gave up three runs — two earned — as CSUB tied the game after the top of the eighth.</p>\n<p>“You know, in hindsight I probably should’ve kept [Justin] Kelly in for a little while longer,” Checketts said. “I think I was thinking about saving him for this weekend and that might’ve been a mistake.”</p>\n<p>After an error by the Gauchos, and with Hatton hitting the next batter, the Roadrunners had two runners on base with no outs. Senior Chance Gusbeth then made UCSB pay by hitting a two-RBI triple to left field, encroaching on UCSB’s 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Trevor Bettancourt then came on to pitch, but he did not fare any better as the next batter, junior infielder Ryan Grotjohn, hit an RBI single scoring Gusbeth and tying the game at three.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the eighth inning, UCSB seemed to wake up as it managed to retake the lead at 4-3 thanks to freshman catcher Sam Cohen, who came in as a sub for Rowan and hit an RBI single to score shortstop Clay Fisher.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had a chance to put Bakersfield away for good, but instead Bettancourt gave up four hits and two runs giving the Roadrunners their first lead of the game at 5-4.</p>\n<p>It was again Gusbeth and Grotjohn who made the key plays as the senior hit a sac-fly RBI to tie the game and the junior hit the game-winning RBI single.</p>\n<p>Grotjohn hit the ball right to Bush, the first baseman, who misplayed it and was unable to get the final out of the inning, which would’ve have left the game tied at four but instead gave Bakersfield the lead.</p>\n<p>“We just played bad. We walk three guys, hit two guys,” Checketts said. “We can’t catch [the ball], the quality of the at-bats are not great. Just bad effort.”</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of the final frame, the Gauchos had their chance to tie and it came down to junior utility Billy Fredrick to get the tying runner, who was on second, home.</p>\n<p>Fredrick hit a beautiful line drive to the right side of the infield but CSUB first baseman Cody White made an amazing diving catch for the final out to seal his team’s 12<span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 20px;\">th</span> victory of the season.</p>\n<p>It was truly an off-day for an often on-point Gaucho team. This loss could either be the beginning of two tales for the young UCSB team. Either this team wakes up and starts playing with the fire it showed early in the season or it could squander its promising start.</p>\n<p>Either way, the answer will come very soon as Santa Barbara’s next series is at home against the top team in the Big West standings and reigning champions Cal State Fullerton this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Devin Wilber / O’Colly</p></div>\n<p>Facing elimination for the first time this postseason, the UCSB baseball team responded in a big way by defeating the University of Miami 5-3 in Monday’s match to stay alive in the College World Series.</p>\n<p>The win improves the Gauchos 43-19-1 on the season, but more importantly keeps them in contention for a championship finish. The loss for the Hurricanes ends their run as they finish with a final record of 50-14 on the season. This was only the second time in their 25 College World Series appearances that they did not register a win at Omaha.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was able to stay alive in the tournament thanks in large part to freshman pitcher Noah Davis who went six innings with three strikeouts and allowed only two hits and one run.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was junior catcher Zack Collins who earned the run off of Davis as in the first inning, with two outs, he hit solo home run to right field to give his team the early 1-0 edge.

Devin Wilber / O’Colly</p></div>\n<p>After surrendering the early run, Miami pitcher Danny Garcia went on to only allow one hit until the rain came and delayed the game for an hour and two minutes in the bottom of the sixth inning with no outs and a runner on first for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>When play resumed, Garcia quickly struck out sophomore Austin Bush who has been struggling as of late. The first baseman finished the day 0-3 with one walk, and has gone 1-11 (.090) over his last three games.</p>\n<p>After Bush, the Gauchos responded with a huge four run spurt before the inning came to a close. After a Muno double and a Dempsey Grover walk, the bases were loaded for junior Ryan Cumberland who came in clutch with a two-RBI single to right field.</p>\n<p>Junior utility Billy Fredrick and senior third baseman Ryan Clark would each laydown bunts to score two more runs and put UCSB up 5-1 after six innings.</p>\n<p>Miami attempted to come back in the eighth inning where it was able to score two runs, courtesy of junior Randy Batista and Collins’s RBI singles to make the game 5-3. The two scores were credited to sophomore left-hander Kyle Nelson who came in the game in the seventh to replace Davis.</p>\n<p>However, in the ninth inning Nelson made quick work of the Hurricanes and ended their season with a 1-4-6 double play. The lefty finished the game allowing five hits and two earned runs but was extremely efficient at the plate as 30 of his 46 pitches were strikes.</p>\n<p>All-in-all it was another solid postseason performance from the young Gaucho team. This was the first College World Series victory in UCSB history and the fans were sure to celebrate it loudly.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When you win your first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CWS?src=hash\">#CWS</a> game in program history… <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CWS?src=hash\">#CWS</a><a href=\"https://t.co/jmGUmzYQOt\">https://t.co/jmGUmzYQOt</a></p>\n<p>— NCAA Baseball (@NCAACWS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NCAACWS/status/745007933113536512\">June 20, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>It was a good sign to see Santa Barbara play well even when on the brink of elimination, but the question is, can it continue that for three more games?</p>\n<p>Even so, this season has been amazing for UCSB and it continues to accomplish great feats as it has now eliminated both the No. 2 team in the nation (Louisville) and the No. 3 team (Miami) from the tournament.

suffered the same fate after Arizona shut them out 3-0 in Wednesday night’s elimination match.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s season ends with a final record of 43-20-1. The 43 wins are now the most wins against Division 1 opponents in a single season for the Gauchos. They also won seven postseason games, which is more than they had won in their previous seven trips combined.</p>\n<p>Arizona improves to 46-22 on the season and will face Oklahoma State on Friday night. The Wildcats will need to defeat the Cowboys twice in order to advance to the College World Series championship, while Oklahoma State just needs one victory to advance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was another tough day for UCSB as for the second time in the last three games it was shutout and held to single digit hits. In the end, the combination of Arizona pitchers JC Cloney and Cameron Ming proved to be too much as they combined to allow six hits and no runs on the evening.</p>\n<p>It was also a tough outing for redshirt senior pitcher Justin Kelly, who only pitched three innings but allowed seven hits and all three earned runs. It was Kelly’s first start since opening weekend of the season. Though it was not the senior’s best outing of his career, it certainly was not from a lack of effort.</p>\n<p>Another senior on the Wildcats, Ryan Aguilar, started the scoring for his team by hitting a sac fly RBI in the third inning with one out. Then sophomore Jared Oliva came to the plate and knocked it out of the ballpark for a two run homer giving Arizona a 3-0 lead after the third.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Gauchos were able to scatter singles here and there throughout the nine innings, but not with enough consistency in a single frame to score a run. No Santa Barbara hitter was able to register more than one hit on the evening.</p>\n<p>Relieving Kelly was right-hander Trevor Bettencourt who pitched a great game and kept UCSB in it right until the very end. The junior went five innings allowing only one hit, no runs while managing five strikeouts. At one point, Bettencourt had retired 13 consecutive batters.</p>\n<p>In the final frame, Santa Barbara had its best chance to break through as sophomore Clay Fisher had a lead-off double, followed by a redshirt junior Devon Gradford walk, which put the tying run at the plate with no outs.</p>\n<p>However, on this night there was no magical finish. There was no game-saving home run, and there was no win. Ming, a sophomore, put away the Gauchos for good, striking out the final three batters, sophomore first baseman Austin Bush, and redshirt sophomores, second baseman JJ Muno, and catcher Dempsey Grover, in succession to seal the 3-0 win for Arizona.</p>\n<p>Those three batters at the plate for Santa Barbara with a chance to tie the game could not have been any better. Bush leads the team in home runs, Muno is an extra base hit machine and Grover consistently is able to get on base, but this night belonged to Arizona. All three put up good at-bats but the pitching from Ming proved to be too much.</p>\n<p>When the match ended, UCSB finally felt what it had done to Xavier, Louisville and Miami: the feeling of being eliminated. The team that was consistently seen smiling and having fun in the dugout now had the look of melancholy as the reality of their ended season set in.</p>\n<p>Even with the loss, the feats accomplished this entire season should not be forgotten. Eliminating the No. 2 and No. 3 seed in this tournament, making its first Super Regional, going to Omaha for the first time, winning a game in the College World Series; this and more made this UCSB baseball season one for the record books and gave hope to a bright future.</p>\n<p>Although the season is over, and now the Gauchos must look to next year, it was still amazing to see this team defy all odds and reach Omaha when at the beginning no one, not even some of the players, even expected to make a regional.</p>\n<p>After 22 long days on the road, its time for UCSB to come home. Although players and coaches would’ve liked to stay a bit longer, their time is up , and it’s time to go back to the drawing board and figure out a plan for next season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Nicolas Eitelbach / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As the weather becomes colder and the fall quarter winds down on campus, so do on-field activities for the UCSB baseball program. After a difficult season last year, finishing with an overall record of 24-32, many others and I were interested to see what would happen to the Gauchos once fall arrived.</p>\n<p>As autumn came and went, the same fall ball clichés that happen to every team across the country occurred; players fought for spots, many took advantage of the weight room and some guys who you thought wouldn’t struggle did, while others you would not expect to do well flourished.</p>\n<p>This is all too typical of fall college baseball. There were, however, several unique and interesting storylines that arose, including the rise of another top prospect in Gaucho blue and gold, a recovering team leader and much more.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Noah Davis, Noah Davis, Noah Davis: Do not forget the name Noah Davis, especially come spring time. Last season, the Gaucho ace was 7-4 as a sophomore with a 4.63 ERA and 65 strikeouts in 81.2 innings pitched. Although still impressive, even Davis himself would tell you those numbers are not good enough, at least for him.</p>\n<p>Last season is last season though.</p>\n<p>Over the summer in the Cape Cod League, Davis garnered the attention by many, if not all, MLB teams after being named to the Top-25 Prospect List by D1 Baseball. In an intentionally limited five appearances for the Cotuit Kettleers, Davis had an ERA of 2.83 against some of the best hitters in the country. As a result, Davis started on the mound every day in the fall, even in an inter-squad game that was the highly anticipated MLB Scout Day.</p>\n<p>Dozens of scouts were there all fall with their radar guns up and ready, seeing Davis reach speeds of up to 97 mph on his fastball and impressive late-life movement on his slider.</p>\n<p>Even though Davis did show a lot of promise in many inter-squad scrimmages, he would leave his fastball up at times, resulting in many hittable pitches from hungry players trying to get noticed by scouts as well.</p>\n<p>“I would not say I faired too well against our competitive hitters, but I can see the way they compete when I’m on the mound,” Davis said after UCSB’s last fall scrimmage of the year. “I don’t think my game stepped up as much as it needed to or as much as I would like it to. My goal for the fall was to stay healthy the whole way through, which I was able to do. I’ve been working on fastball height too, which has taken a step back in the past two weeks, but I am still feeling I’m headed in the right direction.”</p>\n<p>A huge story last season for the Gauchos was the devastating injury to team leader and shortstop Clay Fisher. After medical red-shirting and recovering from Tommy John surgery on his throwing arm, many worried how Fisher would bounce back.</p>\n<p>Although not yet swinging a bat and not throwing at any point this fall, Fisher was still able to participate in many on-field activities. As always, Fisher was smoother than silk on ice during practice and scrimmages. Offensively, due to his recovery process, he could only work on his bunting game in the box.</p>\n<p>“The only thing I feel like I was limited on was taking live at-bats,” Fisher said. “I’ve been taking ground ball reps, I know I can’t throw, but I feel the same in the field as I was in the past so I think I progressed just as well [as anyone else this fall].”</p>\n<p>Many are speculating and questioning the timetable of Fisher’s return, but Fisher wants to let everyone know everything will be alright.</p>\n<p>“I do think that I’ll be 100 percent. It might not be right at the beginning of the season, but I’m definitely making strides. I feel good and I really don’t have any doubts,” the star shortstop said.</p>\n<p>Besides Clay Fisher, other guys were feeling good and not doubting themselves as well. Sophomore Eric Yang, who only had 30 plate appearances in his freshman season, showed up this fall squaring up the pelota, driving the ball gap to gap and around the entire field.</p>\n<p>If you have been paying attention to Yang this summer, though, this is not really a surprise. Again, Yang was another Gaucho who had a fantastic summer hitting .360 with 27 RBI in 36 games in the Great West League for the Medford Rogues.</p>\n<p>Another player who hit the ball well in the fall was junior Michael McAdoo. McAdoo was finding barrel after barrel after barrel all fall, mashing the ball and crushing homeruns in inter-squad games. Making only spot starts and difficult pitch hitting appearances last season, McAdoo hit .227. However, after this breakout fall, with last season’s left fielder Billy Fredrick graduated, McAdoo is making his case to be the Gauchos’ starting left fielder come spring.</p>\n<p>Even the rookies were a cornerstone to how the fall unfolded.</p>\n<p>After having the No. 9 recruiting class in the nation last season, this year the Gauchos were ranked in the top 25 once again at No. 22 in the country by Baseball America.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, some of the youngbloods showed up to play some ball. Three freshmen who can have a potential impact in the spring are RHP Jason Willow, catcher/RHP Christopher Troye and second baseman Marcos Castanon.</p>\n<p>Willow, the Canadian from Victoria, British Columbia, is a loose, goofy 18-year- old who is slowly proving his worth on the mound but has already proved his worth in the clubhouse, as he has no problem keeping the guys loose. When I asked him what it was like being a Gaucho, the freshman gave a typical Willow answer.</p>\n<p>“It’s a cool feeling. I mean, it’s a long time coming, you know, being here, being part of the team. It’s been great so far,” he explained.</p>\n<p>Troye, on the other hand, is all business, especially when he’s on the mound. The catcher, who will see more time as a converted pitcher this season, hit 95 mph on the bump and sat consistently between 93-95 mph when on the mound.</p>\n<p>While working with pitching coach Matt Harvey, Troye developed a curveball and a late-life slider that proved to be devastating when spots were hit. The only question for this young gun will be consistency in the strike zone and location with pitches come springtime. Regardless, Troye’s live arm has already garnered the attention of some MLB scouts.</p>\n<p>The last of the frosh recruits mentioned is second Castanon. Castanon is likely to start at second this year as a true freshman for one reason: This kid can rake.</p>\n<p>Castanon has ridiculous hand eye-coordination to the point where he almost always finds ways to make contact with the ball. Although defense is still a concern for the young infielder, his bat will help him find a way into the lineup.</p>\n<p>Overall, this fall was convincing as the Gauchos look like an improved squad from last year’s team, purely based on talent and by intensity and focus at practice and during games.</p>\n<p>The main concern coming into the fall was pitching as the Gauchos last season had a team ERA of 5.24 and batting average against of .279.</p>\n<p>Both starting pitching and bullpen arms looked a lot more lively and competitive over last year’s squad, but only time will tell if that will hold true. With the first game coming up faster than many think on Feb. 16 at San Diego State, the Gauchos seem poised to have a better season than last year and may surprise many throughout the game of college baseball.</p>\n<p>Fall baseball, otherwise known as Fall Ball, is arguably one of the toughest times for a college baseball player. Not only are players trying to impress coaches, win jobs, get stronger and become more skilled, but they are also battling hundreds of other students in the classroom as well to stay eligible for the spring season.</p>\n<p>As the fall quarter winds down, so does UCSB baseball. As team activities come to a temporary close, it is easy to conclude that the fall was anything but easy for the players.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80079\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80079\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/","id":4165,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.
