Luckily for those fans that would’ve otherwise spent the consumerist holiday wallowing in a puddle of self-pity and loneliness, they received a gift from Yeezus himself.</p>\n<p>However, there was a slight catch. Access to the album could only be obtained through a subscription to Jay Z’s streaming service, Tidal. That being said, the demand for new Ye is undisputed. Overnight, Tidal went from struggling to stay afloat to number one in the app store solely due to the exclusivity. #FACTS</p>\n<p>But, what’s up with the name?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Last year, Mr. West began stirring the pot by releasing the album’s original name, <em>So Help Me God</em>. Shortly after, the title was changed to <em>SWISH</em>, which held strong until very recently when Kanye revealed a shift to <em>Waves</em>. The new name ignited a feud with Wiz Khalifa who believed Kanye stole the slang from imprisoned rapper Max B, curator of the term, “wavy” (publicity stunt, perhaps?). After wife Kim Kardashian conducted various Twitter polls about the three possible title choices, Kanye ultimately chose none of the above. Shocker.</p>\n<p>The meaning behind <em>The Life of Pablo</em> sparked the imaginations of many Twitter philosophers.</p>\n<p>Theories about the ever elusive “Pablo” went rampant, ranging from the notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar to Pablo Picasso, arguably the most influential artist of the 20th century. The latter is more likely when taking in account the lyric, “I feel like Pablo when I’m working on my shoes” and Kanye’s self-proclaimed title as one of the greatest artists of all time.</p>\n<p>However, new rumors stated that Kanye claimed Pablo is actually a reference to St. Paul (Pablo in Spanish) which fits the gospel tunes in “Ultralight Beam,” “Father Stretch My Hands,” his son’s own name and the allusions of Mary and Joseph in the revamped version of “Wolves.”</p>\n<p>Part of the genius of TLOP lies in its hectic release. Kanye gave his fans a front row seat to the makings of an album. It went from an obscure process that magically occurred behind closed doors to a play-by-play experience filled with raw, uncut footage.</p>\n<p>Before embarking on the journey of <em>The Life of Pablo</em>, one must bring their sense of humor because first and foremost, the album is ridiculous. From its multiple name changes and ever-changing track lists, label as a “gospel album,” parade of features and cockiness every step of the way, the purposeful outrageousness is clear.</p>\n<p>The goal is to be talked about. “Everyone gonna say something … I’d be worried if they said nothing”. And what better way to get people talking than with insults? In between poking fun at Rob for his weight and sexual endeavors and reminding Ray J that it doesn’t matter who “may have hit it first,” he also managed to (accidentally?) reignite a feud with Taylor Swift. But hey, who can blame the guy? He already admitted, “I don’t know what it is with females … I’m not too good with that shit.”</p>\n<p>However, the braggadocio humor in “Famous” and “Highlights” starkly contrasts the self-reflection in “Real Friends” and “30 Hours,” which represents Kanye’s game face in social circles as compared to his inner thoughts respectively. He also uses TLOP to reinforce the juxtaposition between the profane and the sacred that has come to identify most of his work. Hence, “pray for Paris, pray for the parents” transitions to “now if I fuck this model and she just bleached her asshole …” Granted, not his best lyrically, but the duality is important here.</p>\n<p>It’s bipolar and doesn’t always make sense. Just like humanity. Kanye’s sometimes flawed, but complete honesty makes TLOP so monumental. It reveals the good, bad and the ugly in humanity.</p>\n<p>And the constant revisions that occurred up until the minute the album was released were not hints of sloppiness, but rather the strokes of creative liberty and passion. Without Chance the Rapper’s last minute prodding to keep “Waves,” already a favorite track, the album would be missing a vital organ. The transition between “I Love Kanye” to “Waves” is so flawless that it makes you wonder how the song was passed up in the first place.</p>\n<p>But yes, overall the album is disjointed.</p>\n<p>Yes, it lacks cohesion.</p>\n<p>Yes, it lacks an overarching message.</p>\n<p>However, are those really problems? Since when did cohesiveness become a staple for artistic expression? Keep in mind that TLOP is coming from an artist who has already proven he is capable of impeccable mixing and mastering. He revolutionized a genre with every album he has put out. He already made his political statements clear. He even created “so many Kanyes.” Therefore, a lack of cohesion cannot be a mere mistake. It cannot be the effect of mediocre mixing. It must be intentional. It’s life.</p>\n<p><em>The Life of Pablo </em>takes you from church to the club to the cemetery. Kanye even manages to bring Frank Ocean out from hiding for this one. It is brilliant in its unpolished realness. So, now, it’s time to just “shut the fuck up and enjoy the greatness.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Rock &amp; roll blasting through speakers, flashing multicolored lights and densely packed students jumping in every direction made Thursday night’s Battle of the Bands a beacon of excitement amongst a quiet campus. UCSB students escaped the looming threat of midterms for a few hours and rocked out to some of Isla Vista’s local bands at the Hub. The Associated Students-sponsored event gave five bands the chance to compete for a grand prize: a professionally recorded music video created by UCSB Amplified.</p>\n<p>Students migrated from the beer garden to the crowd in front of the stage as the first band, Feral Vida, took the stage. Their friendly smiles were met with shouts of “Feral Vida!” from the growing mass of people. The band kept the cheers going with an upbeat tempo and Augie Houlemard’s loud, raspy vocals that filled the room. Both guitarists demonstrated their dexterity during their cover of Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy” with long guitar riffs and drawn-out high notes. Feral Vida got the crowd jumping and ready for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>With a steady beat and mellow sound, Frisson created a more relaxed atmosphere. The slow guitar picking and lower vocals in their first few songs got the crowd swaying and nodding their heads to the beat. Many students made their way back to the beer garden to tap along from the comfort of their seats. The band picked up the pace later in the set with a fast beat and head banging that brought people back to the dance floor.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Kaitlyn Haberlin, smiling and wide-eyed, remarked, “The first two acts were really cool. I’m surprised at the skill and ability they have as artists. They’re super awesome and fun and they get the crowd excited.”</p>\n<p>Savage Henry took the stage next, their sense of fun and humor revealed before they even began to play. They danced to the intermission music while onstage and playfully pointed their guitars at the audience. The set began with a chest-pounding beat and Wilder Kehke’s high, vibrato-filled voice. The sudden quickening of the drums and loud guitar chords incited mosh pits and crowd surfing as the two guitarists played face-to-face onstage. The lively group finished their set with a clash of smashing drums, squealing guitar and sweeping keyboard in an epic climax.</p>\n<p>Sanders Circus came off strong from the start with loud, grainy electric guitar and calls of “Are you ready?” from guitarist and vocalist David Kuperman. During their cover of “Purple Haze,” Kuperman took the spotlight, dropping to his knees dramatically as he played. His guitar riffs played from behind his head sent the crowd into a frenzy while bassist Joe Barnes gave each song a full sound with funky bass solos. John Pagliassotti, a member of Savage Henry, said of Sanders Circus, “Oh yeah, these guys can really wail.” Lights flashed rapidly as the band finished with a flourish of cymbals.</p>\n<p>From smooth, harmonious guitar to quick bursts of drums and bass, The Don’ts demonstrated their skill and versatility while the crowd chanted their name. Clear, lingering high notes and sliding guitar from both guitarists, Blake Elliot and Ben Seilhamer, created a dynamic sound. Smooth bass and mellow vocals from Mitchell Solkov quickly became a jarring blast of guitar and throaty belting as the song picked up in tempo. Multiple guitar solos and lightning-fast riffing from the two guitarists left the crowd cheering once again.</p>\n<p>The Hub erupted in applause when Savage Henry, the winning band, took the stage. Kehke, all smiles, humbly approached the microphone, calling out to the audience, “Thank you for supporting our band, and supporting all the bands here tonight!” When asked about their performance, Pagliassotti replied, “It was great. We practiced this set like 10 times in the last week, so it was so easy to play the music that you just focus on having fun.” Drummer Will Hettel remarked with a laugh, “To put things in perspective we pretty much never practice, so it was a change in pace.”</p>\n<p>The Battle of the Bands was a clear demonstration of the flourishing arts and music in I.V. Each band brought a unique aspect of performance to the stage, whether in their music or in the way they had fun onstage. With many different styles, personalities and talents, students experienced a night filled with variety all with the classic sound of rock and roll.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/battle-of-the-bands-brings-large-turnout-to-the-hub/","id":6795,"author":{"id":701,"name":"Allie Graydon"},"related":[6794,6793,6792],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Citizen Cope Brings V-Day to SOhO Early","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-17-citizen-cope.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-17-citizen-cope.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was like any other Friday night in downtown Santa Barbara.

The streetlights illuminated couples, friends and acquaintances, all making their way to the next restaurant, bar or both. Everyone was ready to find some escape this President’s Day weekend. SOhO’s signature brick walls enclosed a full house that night, it’s patrons eagerly awaiting to see Citizen Cope (Clarence Greenwood) perform his <em>With Love</em> compilation. The compilation is a journey through Cope’s discography starting from the nineties till now. A majority of the crowd appeared to be older than your average UCSB student, all die hard lovers of his music.</p>\n<p>Daniel Vasquez, the manager of the club that night who had seen Citizen Cope some time before, assured me that this would be an enjoyable performance. He also mentioned that Cope was very particular about how his audience behaves during his sets. Apparently, he has been known to walk off the stage due to rambunctious crowds. This explained all of the signs posted around the venue asking its patrons to be respectful toward the solo act that night.</p>\n<p>The request appeared strange at first; however, the crowd worked as one so as to maintain a certain level of peace. Citizen Cope walked on stage to great applause, his warm smile drawing the remainder of the restaurant to the stage. Bathed in blue, red and purple light, Citizen Cope began his set, treating spectators to the solemn and gentle chords from his guitar. Cope’s music jumps between genres, sometimes lying directly in between two. He will blend and borrow from various styles and make them his own. His <em>With Love</em> compilation showcases his talents in playing blues, rock, hip hop and more.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Citizen Cope delivered Friday night, his voice adding a degree of authenticity and soul to his past works. With each part of his set, Cope channeled the pain and moments of love present in his lyrics. The crowd quietly sang along and swayed with their significant others, possibly remembering past relations or happy romances. Who knows? With songs like “Salvation” and “Bullet and a Target,” one experiences a darker side to the narratives Cope wrote into his songs. The disco ball overhead swayed slowly, reflecting the stage lights through the rafters of the venue. Through the haze of purple, the crowd danced slowly along to the steady rhythm of Cope’s set. It was an amusing sight when fans shushed pockets of patrons of the louder variety as the next song began, most likely to ensure the best show possible. As a collective, spectators cheered as Cope began performing favorite after favorite. “Let the Drummer Kick” had Cope playing alongside a recorded beat and piano melody; he jokingly said to the crowd, “This next acoustic song is gonna have some accompaniment with some tape. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to play it, and I know all of you want to hear it.” The crowd responded ecstatically as a bass kick and snare hit shook the venue, bodies moving to the steady hiss of a hi-hat.</p>\n<p>Citizen Cope returned for an encore to a still-packed venue. The cheers called Cope back to the stage for a few more songs to close out the night. “Hurricane Waters” had the audience participate by clapping along to the beat, echoing “I will carry you” and “hurricane waters.” The crowd’s voice bounced across the walls, creating a serene moment between them and Cope at the end of the night.</p>\n<p>Citizen Cope brought an intense mixture of blues, rock and hip hop to SOhO. His voice complimented the bluesy scales, it’s accent almost morphing away from the west coast to something more mid-western or southern. Cope finished up a fantastic show, bringing out love and a whole box of other emotions for the venue to experience — definitely an appropriate start to the three day weekend and Valentine’s Day.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68369\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68369\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/citizen-cope-brings-v-day-to-soho-early/","id":6796,"author":{"id":724,"name":"Vincent Beck"},"related":[6795,6794,6793],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"STRFKR Gets Rowdy in VNTRA","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/strfkr-e1455775782320.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/strfkr-e1455775782320.png?resize=800%2C517&ssl=1","description":"STRFKR is very serious about not being taken too seriously.

Ironically lifting their name from the label slapped onto those willfully entrenched in the celebrity lifestyle they so eschew, STRFKR’s live set perfectly crystallizes their direct dedication to keeping things fun.</p>\n<p>Fake Drugs started the show off with a set hurtling down a cyberpunk highway at 80 mph on a Tron bike. The electro-punk duo slapped some frenetic strings over new wave synths and squawked distorted, unintelligible vocals. While the Drugs maintained a high energy throughout, their show would’ve been greatly enhanced by the addition of a live drummer; without one, they lacked the rawness that an exciting punk act should exhibit. Though not all that compelling in and of itself, their synthy vibe served to whet the collective appetite for Com Truise, the second act of STRFKR’s winter tour.</p>\n<p>Com Truise seemed to appear all at once, assuming his position helming an expansive dual-Macbook mixing station. Silent and stoic and clad in a plain black tee, he spun a pulsing set of his ’80s synthwave repertoire. Com Truise and the entire stage were highlighted over by melting geometries in neon pastels, unfortunately dim as a result of presumably deficient projector settings. Enthused audience members cast crude shadow puppets on the spiraling visuals, nipping and winking innocently at the unalterable DJ. After bumping back-to-back jams like crowd favorite “VHS Sex,” Com Truise departed coolly, without a word. His music spoke loudly enough to set the perfect palette for STRFKR to paint their vibrant poppy melodies with.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As the crowd shuffled with anticipation for the main event, a fog machine puffed out its haze incessantly, shrouding the stage in mystique. As STRFKR took the stage and began to play, the reason become clear; the six pillars of shifting light and color standing behind the band was allowed to play in the negative space, effusing a chameleon glow throughout the theater, perfectly timed with their upbeat rhythms.</p>\n<p>The set was constant crescendo. Despite maintaining their grooving mellow throughout, the band managed to draw out more and more crazed feedback from their audience with every song. Draped in a velvet dress that could’ve been snatched from his grandmother’s closet, frontman Joshua Hodges crooned softly as his bandmates deftly riffed through their collection of indie poptronica tunes. The four appeared a little bit mismatched on stage, to charming effect. Pointing out each member individually, UCSB second-year Johanna Ramirez noted “That one looks like he came from a Renaissance faire, that one looks like a dad, that one a college dropout and that guy a high school student that plays in a band at night.”</p>\n<p>Despite their quirky aesthetic differences, the band expertly meshed together sonically.</p>\n<p>The four of them stayed playful throughout, not afraid to shuffle up their spots on stage. Hodges and drummer Keil Corcoran traded spots for “German Love,” and bassist Shawn Glassford joined the scramble for a trio of covers, including The Human League’s “Don’t You Want Me” and New Order’s “Blue Monday.” During their famous rendition of Cyndi Lauper’s (er, Robert Hazard’s) “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” friends of the band arrived on stage decked out in spacesuits to launch confetti cannons from their groins. The rowdy astronauts also incited a spree of (excessive) crowdsurfing throughout the audience, much to the chagrin of the venue’s hyperactive security guards.</p>\n<p>After blasting through hits like “Rawnald Gregory Erickson the Second,” “Malmo” and “While I’m Alive,” the band departed to clamorous roars from the audience. As a soft light hung in the foggy haze, recorded speech (presumably the words of Alan Watts, a big influence on Hodges) was drowned out by the calls of the crowd for more. The intermission stretched on, but the crowd was relentless, erupting ecstatically when the band resumed the stage to close the night out with an encore consisting of “Pop Song” and “Bury Us Alive,” culminating with a rock-star performance of “Leave It All Behind” among flaring strobes of darkness and white light. By the end of the set, Hodges lank hair stuck to his forehead, a facsimile of the turbo energy the audience channeled increasingly up to the very last song of the night. The band thanked their parents watching above in the Ventura Majestic’s closed-off balcony, and left the stage graciously to the applause of a crowd that’d just had a seriously good FKing time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68367\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68367\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/68367/","id":6797,"author":{"id":715,"name":"Frank Horne"},"related":[6796,6795,6794],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
