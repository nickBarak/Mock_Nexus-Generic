Yes, the Wednesday Hump is reality. But, in honor of Halloween weekend, let’s talk about out-of-towners. Yeah, they’re fucking annoying, and they’re like desperate eighth-graders begging to fit in, but don’t lie — they have a special place in our hearts (especially when they’re nicely wrapped in a person that’s not themselves).</p>\n<p>We love to hate them, and we hate to love them. Half the girls walk around wearing something so short the whole world can see their pancreas; the guys all find it necessary to throw their arms around any girl that comes within two feet of them, and we’re not sure whether we should be offended or just use it to our advantage.</p>\n<p>There’s a fine line between a walk of shame and just starting around two (or three … or four) hours too early. Is it really kosher to be dressed in a thong and bra, wandering DP before noon yelling, “I’m a Victoria’s Secret Angellllllll”?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Yeah. Okay. Where are your wings, bitch?</p>\n<p>And what about the Douche Lord who’s attempting to brag about his sex life 24/7, and trying to justify bringing home those tore-up-from-the-floor-up girls, too. “Yeah, you know you gotta slay some dragons before you get the princess. It’s whatever bro. Just livin’ the dream.”</p>\n<p>These things would never happen without our beloved out-of-towners. We, on the other hand, are too self-proclaimed goddamn brilliant to say these things (or at least get caught saying them).</p>\n<p>But see, one of two things happens when we bring an out-of-towner back to our humble abode: we either try that one thing in bed that we’ve always wanted to try, or we fall in love.</p>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to do something absolutely obnoxious just to see what the other person’s reaction would be? Like, could you imagine having sex with a girl, pulling out, cumming on her face and yelling triumphantly, “I’ve got 99 problems but a baby ain’t one”? Maybe that’s too absurd, but I’m pretty sure her face would be priceless — and not just because it would be covered in jizz.</p>\n<p>Halloween is a great time to try out the whole role-playing thing, but there are some people who take their outfits way too seriously. You scored Kim Kardashian, well a girl pretending to be her … close enough, and then halfway through sex she says, “Ohh, can you actually move a little to the left? I think the video camera might be cutting you off.” Shit. Hopefully you dressed as Ray J.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, though, we fall into the trap. Anyone can be super cool when a) you’re only talking to them for 20 minute increments and b) you know that there’s a 98 percent chance you’re never going to see them again. They can easily lie about how fucking awesome they are pre-bone, and then once it’s realized that modern technology was invented, they’ll be scrambling to revamp their Facebook on the three hour ride home before it’s safe to accept your friend request.</p>\n<p>But regardless of how cool we might think they are, we get to ride on our own ego boost the entire time. They think our over-used jokes are fucking hilarious because they haven’t heard them 76 times like the rest of our friends. You basically build a pseudo-relationship that lasts 96 hours, tops. It’s pretty hard to fuck up with that time frame, so it’s pretty easy to think that this out-of-towner is the coolest person ever. If only they had gone to UCSB, then all of your dreams and fantasies would come true.</p>\n<p>On Monday, once the out-of-towners got the fuck out of our way, we got to party with the true Isla Vistians. And, as you were raging your face off — ‘cause it’s a school night and you have a midterm tomorrow but that doesn’t matter because we live in fucking Santa Barbara, man — there comes that awkward moment when dream boy isn’t so dreamy anymore, and he actually lives on Sabado (oh, fuck) … and you’re dressed as Rihanna, and he’s … uh … Chris Brown.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks is probably one of those girls that wore the t-shirts with “Slut Barn” written on them last Floatopia.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42496\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/outoftowners-bad/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42496\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/outoftowners-bad/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/outoftowners-bad/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/outoftowners-bad/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/outoftowners-bad/","id":6422,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6421,6420,6419],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks","biography":"Not available","articles":[6391,6392,6415,6417,6418,6420,6421,6422,6425,6426,6427,6428,6429],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The “Real World” Really Does Suck (And Not in That Way)","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Four long years ago, I was a senior in college.

I don’t remember much about that year (but that’s the subject of another column entirely—perhaps Memoirs of an Old Town Tavern Addict or Long Island Iced Tea For Dummies), but I do remember this: I would have paid for a chance to write The Wednesday Hump. Happily, I somehow tricked the editors into paying me with a little bit of money and the privilege to spend time in the beautiful Daily Nexus office.</p>\n<p>The day UCSB forced me to graduate was the worst day of my life. Not only were my friends and I thrust into the big bad world of jobs and close-toed shoes, but I no longer had an excuse to spend weekends conducting research for a sex column. (Mom, if you’re reading this, please mentally replace ‘sex’ with ‘relationship’ and, of course, immediately stop reading.) The summer after graduation was a dark time for me. There was a void where vibrating cock rings and weekly trips to The Adult Store had once been. But then I had an epiphany! I know, I thought. I’ll go to law school!</p>\n<p>What? You may be asking yourself what law school and The Adult Store could possibly have in common. Good question. You see, four years at UCSB had brainwashed me into thinking that people enjoy fun. In my law school fantasy, I would waltz into the administration office and charm the dean into granting me the first sex column a law school had ever seen. It would be called On the Bench or Under the Robe or some other vaguely suggestive courtroom reference. There was only one flaw in my master plan: law school is a serious place. So serious, in fact, that I never got the courage to propose my idea.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Actually, that’s not strictly true. I did propose it to a few of my classmates, but rather than starting a petition, my new friends simply Googled my name, started an e-mail chain with links to The Wednesday Hump and unwittingly ruined my already-slim chance of ever obtaining employment as a lawyer. I don’t know if you know this, but lawyers don’t like to hire people who once wrote an article about the most polite way to reject a threesome. Fair enough. I wouldn’t hire me, either.</p>\n<p>Although my hopes of becoming the Carrie Bradshaw of law school were dashed, I stayed because I was already there. Perhaps that’s not the best reason to commit three years of your life to something, but the rationale made sense in my 22-year-old mind. Also, Cosmo didn’t respond to my pathetic (or awesome —however you want to look at it) letter in which I pled for a job, a mailroom internship or anything that would get me out of law school and into the hallways of Hearst. So I finished law school. I graduated this past May and here I am, pleading with the editors of the Daily Nexus for the chance to write one more Wednesday Hump.</p>\n<p>To the three of you who are still reading, please, heed my advice: You have four (or three… or two… or one!) years to have innovative sex. Use them. As I’m sure your parents, siblings and older friends have told you, everything is better in college. Before your life becomes a clusterfuck of embarrassing job interviews, long-distance friendships and quarter-life crises, take pleasure — literally and figuratively — in your current state of freedom. Whether you’re in a relationship, playing the field, or enjoying a ‘complicated’ hook-up situation, make sure you partake in the things that become inappropriate the minute you graduate.</p>\n<p>Let me provide you with an example: My college boyfriend and I liked to break away from Friday night ragers to have sex on the stairs leading from the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive down to the beach. I’m sure we weren’t the only ones. In fact, there were nights the stairs were shared. I never considered it at the time, but those nights were fleeting. If I did that now, I would spend the entire night craning my neck to make sure nobody was watching. And if I attempted it in 10 years, I would probably break my neck.</p>\n<p>Aside from where you do it, embrace how you do it. My favorite Wednesday Hump research was for a column I wrote about ballcuzzis. Although the lucky guy and I later agreed that ballcuzzis sound better than they feel, sneaking into his parent’s kitchen to heat up a bowl of milk and find a straw was a novelty. If his parents had caught us then, they probably would have rolled their eyes. Now that we’re supposedly old enough to know better, both generations would be mortified.</p>\n<p>My point is this: Carpe diem. Forgive me if I’m wrong, but I believe that’s Latin for “grab a straw.”</p>\n<p><em>Dana Olsen will likely never be old enough to know better — and for that, the Nexus commends her.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41363\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/real-world-suck/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41363\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/real-world-suck/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/real-world-suck/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/real-world-suck/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/real-world-suck/","id":6419,"author":{"id":490,"name":"Dana Olsen"},"related":[6418,6417,6416],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Early Morning Stealth Fails, Awkwardness Prevails","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If you haven’t had the sheer terror of waking up in a bed that’s not your own, with your first thought being, “I need to get the fuck out of here,” then you haven’t lived.

But, if you do successfully toot it and boot it, you sly dog you, make sure you have all of your stuff with you. If you end up getting back your forgotten items in the same state you left them in, consider yourself lucky. You were outta there faster than a midget in a dunk contest, and let’s face it, people don’t forget.</p>\n<p>You know, I don’t know what it is about bras, but they always end up in places they don’t belong: a kitchen cabinet, a tree. Sometimes their roommate will discover it and throw it out. That’s 40 bucks I’ll never see again, and it was yellow — so, yeah, that was a ray of sunshine I lost too.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, even a repeat hookup can still make you want to get away, maybe even more so, because of that. When morning sex is out of the question, and you really have nothing witty on hand to say, it is simply time to go. One and done, hit it and quit it, lay without pay, I could go on for days here. Lesson learned: don’t be a lingerer. But what exactly is proper morning after etiquette to assure you won’t be just that?</p>\n<p>Let’s face it, no one looks quite as good as they did the night before. It could be because the beer goggles are gone, but add that to the sex hair, running makeup and face creases from your pillow, and well, would you look at that. Shit just got real.</p>\n<p>No one can be bothered worrying about someone’s feelings when you look like you just got hit by the hangover bus. But, you know, you have to at least pretend. My go-to move was always to climb over the other (still sleeping) person, but it never worked. You know that saying, “They always come back?” Well, in this case, they always wake up. I’ll be naked in broad daylight looking for my clothes when they happen to catch me.</p>\n<p>God, you know? That awkward moment when you’re bent in half gathering your items, and peek back just to make sure you didn’t make the worst mistake of your life the night before, and they’re face down, ass up, making eye contact with you, wondering just the same.</p>\n<p>No, the worst possible thing that can happen is when the other person wakes up when you’re in the process of climbing, mid straddle. Let’s not beat around the bush here, no pun intended, one of you has morning wood, so either way you’re about two inches away from hitting up round two. It’s pretty much safe to say that whoever is waking up is down to work off their hangover rather than drowning it in Mexican food.</p>\n<p>Well, so far this has all been under the assumption that you didn’t bring the person home to your house, which is most definitely something to be considered. Welcome to the world of stage five clinger. There’s nothing worse than being trapped in your own house. Ditching this one? Lie, my friend, lie. Say your parents are coming, say you have to meet someone for breakfast, do what you gotta do, kid. You were smart enough to get into this school; you’re smart enough to gaucho ass outta there. (Sorry for being school spirited … go soccer).</p>\n<p>Anyway, just make sure you follow through with your lie. Don’t start gallivanting around I.V. because you will run into them. Seriously, it will happen. It’s Murphy’s Law or some shit. Look it up.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately if these two escape routes fail, no matter whose house you’re shackin’ at, it pretty much leaves you with talking. You can even use the opportunity to become best friends with their roommate. Or, casually insult him or her so that at least two out of the three people in the room want you to be gone.</p>\n<p>Really though, let’s not kid ourselves here, text a friend, have them call you and claim they left their keys at your house. That one’s so urgent that you’ll typically get a ride home and you can even act apologetic. It’s brilliant, I promise. Works every damn time.</p>\n<p>Be forewarned though, now that you’re out, safe and sound, don’t immediately go to Bagel Café. He or she will undoubtedly have a fucking breakfast club that goes there.</p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks would rather kick a puppy than be caught naked, hovering over her undergarments.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-12/early-morning-stealth-fails-awkwardness-prevails/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-12/early-morning-stealth-fails-awkwardness-prevails/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-12/early-morning-stealth-fails-awkwardness-prevails/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-12/early-morning-stealth-fails-awkwardness-prevails/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-12/early-morning-stealth-fails-awkwardness-prevails/","id":6420,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6419,6418,6417],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"There’s No ‘I’ In Team; And It Really Doesn’t Matter What Team You’re Playing for Anyway","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There are a lot of good things about threesomes.

Draw a diagram if this is getting confusing, just make sure you’re not sketching it in your blue book.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the hardest part of tag teaming is negotiating it. No one is going to offer up, “Let’s go bitch, I’ve done action films.” There’s even a chance that it could start out purely innocent, like watching “Good Burger” on a ’90s Nickelodeon throwback. You could even have brewed up some hot chocolate. Maybe you’re all wearing matching fuzzy socks, cooking some pumpkin bread in the oven and then boom: you’re living out every man’s fantasy. Well, maybe not the “Good Burger” part.</p>\n<p>You know shit’s about to get real when you get the look. It’s all about “the look.” There’s a difference between getting your flirt on and, “Holy shit, this guy/girl is down for a tag team.” “The look” is not subtle. It’s like an eyefuck-and-a-half. And that’s an understatement. Trust me, you’ll know it when you see it.</p>\n<p>Men seem to be fascinated by the fact that women can talk to one another with their eyes. Well, it comes in handy for situations like these, when you end up lacing fingertips with your best friend over the same guy’s dick. That one moment of “are we doing this?” can be conveyed pretty fast without a knee-jerk reaction of shouting, “WHAT THE FUCK?!”</p>\n<p>Once that brave soul lets on that this tag team is crossing the line of mere suggestiveness and entering into the grounds of actually happening, you’ve got to make sure everyone’s on board. It may be uncomfortable, but it avoids that awkward moment of, “Holy shit that is there, and I was just stumbling in here to nap and rally.”</p>\n<p>The undeniable question of who goes first in the sexual endeavors you’ve decided upon needs to be determined quickly. Rock-paper-scissors, coin flip, whoever gets there first … whatever seems appropriate. For that unlucky soul who gets sloppy seconds, if you’re still down, try not to think too hard about the situation and just go with it. Or pull a Houdini and make the other one go again after you. Karma’s a bitch, yo.</p>\n<p>This could be the greatest story two best friends have ever created together. Maybe you fist pumped before, during and after. Turns out you have synchronized “O” faces. Who knew? Maybe you shared your first “too soon” joke right after it was finished. Hah! Riddle me this: It’s parents weekend and I’m sure they’d love to meet you. Debriefing and cocktails, anyone?</p>\n<p>Or it could be the most awkward encounter you’ve ever endured. Maybe it ruins hotdogs for you forever. Say goodbye to those afternoon Dogtown dates. Maybe you need to rethink your schedule when pass times come up.</p>\n<p>“Damn, I was really trying to take CLIT 197 but Sally and Joey are already in it. Gotta clit playin’ around here and get my shit together.” But, hey, it saves you the shame of ever repeating the story aloud because your bestie already knows. Check out that silver lining. Damn I’m good.</p>\n<p>Now, just to make things interesting, look to your left. And … look to your right. You’re it. Ever been to Paris, baby?</p>\n<p>Sources close to Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks say she’s actually a bit of an attention-whore in the bedroom.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42248\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-26/team-doesnt-matter-team-youre-playing/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42248\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-26/team-doesnt-matter-team-youre-playing/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-26/team-doesnt-matter-team-youre-playing/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-26/team-doesnt-matter-team-youre-playing/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-26/team-doesnt-matter-team-youre-playing/","id":6421,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6420,6419,6418],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
