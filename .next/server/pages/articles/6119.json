Some of the explosions that pop in this melting pot are shameful — rapes and “riots,” stabbings and pollution — and unfortunately, these are the headline-grabbers. When friends and relatives from around the globe are worrying about whether or not we survived Deltopia, a reputation builds.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to interpret these events as evidence that Isla Vista is an economic drain on the county and a vapid cultural black hole, but this zoomed-out viewpoint that the media latches onto is not an accurate reflection of our square mile. There’s so much going on that slides under the surface and gets swallowed by the noise. The energy here is always palpable, and when it’s channeled in the right direction, a truly unique culture emerges.</p>\n<p>I.V. has always been a mysterious misfit, a jagged appendage that surrounding cities would love to hack off and send adrift in the Pacific Ocean. But despite the inherent sense of uncertainty and transience, there is an abundance of culture in this pressure cooker. Spring quarter alone features the park concerts Earth Day, Chilla Vista, Surfrider and Wordstock; there’s the Reel Loud film festival, Shakespeare in the Park, Theater and Dance productions and constant exhibitions of students’ visual art. Each Wednesday music echoes from Storke Plaza and the Music bowl; every weekend live bands rock house parties while comedy lights up Embarcadero Hall. Open Mics are an institution at the Coffee Collab and Gio’s. Arts &amp; Lectures, Program Board, OSL and the MCC consistently offer diverse, rich and affordable events, lectures and films to our campus and community; The Catalyst and WORD magazines bring a definitive flair in both visual-literary arts and journalism, respectively. The various Co-Ops provide their own distinct art and flavor, and undocumented work is being done by thousands of residents every day.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The obvious truth is that Isla Vista is far more complex and sophisticated than the papers, periodicals and primetime newsbreaks portray. The obvious truth is that something is wrong with Isla Vista. But the even more obvious truth, under our very noses, is that there is a vital and lively culture in Isla Vista that thrives and somehow puts all this madness in context. It’s only a matter of finding it amidst the chaos.</p>\n<p>This neighborhood is too strange and vibrant to simply abandon to the rising tides of an amnesiac party culture which, now more than ever, threatens to drown our voices. It’s true that most of us are only here for a few years, but that shouldn’t dampen or misdirect our enthusiasm. These are still four years in our very limited lives, and we are lucky enough to be in a place that offers as much room for creativity, freedom and experimentation as it does for drunken shenanigans. College is not just a throwaway time before “real life.” We’re all at critical points of transition, establishing habits and values that we’ll carry far away from this corner of the coast.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s a blessing in disguise that I.V. is unincorporated. We can define our town and ourselves for the future, but nobody’s going to twist our wrists. We have the opportunity to determine our own fate, which means that we get both the excitement and responsibility that go along with it. The current student body and greater citizens of this town will make a decision: either feed into the stereotypes being foisted upon us by the media, police, politicians and ourselves or prove that Isla Vista is a visceral, real, strangely creative and subversive place that deserves more than just generalization and rhetoric. If we hope to actually make a lasting change here then taking a look at our environment from an analytic and artistic angle is the crucial first step.</p>\n<p>Art is more than social lubricant: It can be a rallying cry or a fiery critique, it can incite dialogue and inspire more creative solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems. Art is the exploration for meaning in an excessively chaotic and complex society that grows more convoluted with every passing day. People here often complain how they can hardly wait to leave, yet these are the same people who dedicate themselves to the gamut of creative social work, just by being students and residents here. It’s time we see our own individual pursuits as a vivid and important part of our town as a whole, something to be illuminated and celebrated, something more powerful than the sensational violence and senseless stereotypes that we tend to give legitimacy to in our everyday gossip.</p>\n<p>Everyone here is passionate about something, and it’s up to us as a community to showcase and spread the flames. That’s what culture is — it’s not some exclusive aristocratic pastime, it’s the aspects of life we care about and give meaning to. And it’s everywhere here. We just need to shine a brighter light and turn up the amps. We’re only at about seven right now, and this one goes to 11.</p>\n<p><em>Adrian Gronseth and Sean Nolan are both fourth-year English Majors.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

First, that huge leverage was an artifact of the fractional reserve system of money that the world has been using since the end of the gold standard. This allows for the creation of leverage. The problem here is that our fiat money system only works in a constantly expanding economy. When the economy slows, contracts and starts heading in the wrong direction, shit can hit the fan fast because it doesn’t take much for banks to become under-capitalized. Calling out Ron Paul here is backward and totally wrong since he’s such a huge proponent of the gold standard. Something like this could not happen under a gold standard even if you had less regulation.</p>\n<p>Second, the executives at MF Global co-mingled funds from their own trades and their customers, which is illegal. People are going to end up in jail for this. All this you neglected to mention.</p>\n<p>Next time please look at both sides of the situation, not just the bits that best fit your views. It’s time we get some real change and fresh ideas. Ron Paul and others like him know what’s wrong here and have been trying to warn the country that this economic crisis was going to happen years before. Nobody in power did; instead, they perpetuated it and the media openly laughed at them. You can keep trying the same old thing in 2012, but I know who I’ll be voting for come next year, even if I have to write his name in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

As Art Director of The Daily Nexus, I have a general understanding of how college newspapers function, and I am curious as to how it could be possible to publish an article with so many questionable statements.</p>\n<p>To say that I am concerned with the following quote is an understatement; I think ‘embarrassed’ is appropriate. These descriptors should not be tolerated within a 100-mile radius of a University:</p>\n<p>“Through her paintings, sculptures and performance art, Niebuhr explores femininity in both a metaphorical and literal sense, questioning these preconceived notions and behaviors, and the good and bad ways women interact with each other.” This statement cheapens the intent of my solo exhibition and the very intent of my art-making process. To The Bottom Line, this makes you look “bad”.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I did hear about this from a student who felt that it went too far,” said Leila Rupp, a professor from the Department of Feminist Studies. “Rape is a very serious and emotionally laden matter, and I do think that pretending to be a survivor of rape is problematic for a number of reasons.”</p>\n<p>How strong is the foundation of a statement that rests on hand-me-down knowledge?  To have a quote from a professor with whom I have never spoken to, who did not experience the physical performance, and hasn’t even seen the gallery documentation of the performance, makes this professor seem utterly detached, and dare I say it, lazy. Congratulations, Bottom Line, you have added a dramatic flair to the art review that will keep your readers interested, but at what cost?</p>\n<p>My “Facedown” Performance artwork was serious. It was emotionally laden. But most importantly, it was pertinent for myself, for those around me, and for my community. I will continue to support rape survivors and those close to rape survivors as they decide, for themselves, what is the best way to heal.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like the thing in my culture,” said Jessica Rangel, a biology major, “how it’s all about finding a man and getting married and having kids”</p>\n<p>All right guys, this could get crazy, but have at it: I am a feminist AND I am simultaneously excited to get married to the man I love and to have children with him. My vision of ‘Neo-Feminism’ calls for respect in gender equality, but it also calls for tolerance in the resurgence of feminine sensuality and ideals. I am aware of my gender, and I am aware of, in some cases, the oppression of my gender, but I am also aware of my inherent power as a woman, and I will embrace this power.  There are no works in the exhibition that point toward the use of this quotation from Rangel (who actually did not even visit the exhibition).</p>\n<p>“That crossed my mind. I hoped people weren’t doing anything because they thought I was [sunbathing].” Niebuhr said. “But I was covered in blood.”</p>\n<p>If you are as confused as I am with this statement, I forgive you. A word of advice for The Bottom Line, if you are going to have a reporter use quotations, make sure the documentation of those quotes are correct.</p>\n<p>And for the juicy Grand Finale, I encountered what I can only assume to be a made-up post on the online version of the article from Professor Garious Tomkink, fictional author of “Hogwarts: A History”:</p>\n<p>“I am not a fan of Fluffy art. Art should have clear meaning and artistic inspiration. This is a good review from the author. The Bottom Line you have a real gem here. There are so many other, more productive ways to express the hurt and pain that comes along with rape, that don’t involve ugly performance art.”</p>\n<p>While I appreciate the…ummm…simplicity of Professor Tomkink’s comment (and lack of existence), it is my wish that The Bottom Line could understand the actual intent of the performance artwork, as well as the intent of the exhibition as a whole. If one had actually experienced “Pretty Fluffy Squishy Hard” in person, I assume that one would realize, as any normal person would (normal is relative when imaginary professors can comment on your art review), that absolutely nothing about my exhibition was tangibly (nor metaphorically) fluffy, except perhaps the fur covered speakers that played the sounds of human indifference to a train track suicide on October 21, 2011.</p>\n<p>I asked professor Tomkink to meet me for coffee to discuss the response. No reply yet. And that, my friends, is the power of written word; the power to completely convey something entirely different from what actually existed.</p>\n<p>Response from the Bottom Line: “We are sorry that you had such a strong negative reaction …”</p>\n<p>My bottom line: Yeah, me too.</p>\n<p>Kiki Niebuhr is a fourth-year art major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43217\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/hogwarts-professor-misinterprets-student-art-exhibit/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43217\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/hogwarts-professor-misinterprets-student-art-exhibit/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/hogwarts-professor-misinterprets-student-art-exhibit/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/hogwarts-professor-misinterprets-student-art-exhibit/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/hogwarts-professor-misinterprets-student-art-exhibit/","id":6117,"author":{"id":548,"name":"Kiki Niebhur"},"related":[6116,6115,6114],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Couch Burning in Isla Vista:  From Someone Who’s Been There","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/11657346-burn12.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/11657346-burn12.jpg?resize=604%2C453&ssl=1","description":"Noah Nevins writes to the Daily Nexus about what he learned from being involved in a couch burning. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Hi, my name is Noah Nevins. As per the request of the district attorney, I have written this letter about the dangers of couch fires, something that so many students DON’T KNOW about! Nobody takes it seriously, and I hope my letter helps other students as well.</p>\n<p>Where to start? I guess I should start by saying I had a great time and learned a lot as a Santa Barbara City College student, but living in Isla Vista came at a price. Apart from all of the parties and the endless surf sessions with friends, there is a serious epidemic in the area. I’m not talking about drinking; I’m talking about the endless couch fires that so many know too well.</p>\n<p>I had my first encounter with a couch fire when I was riding my bike along the street and a crowd of students were sitting around a burning couch in the middle of the street. It might be strange to most people, but it is very normal here. And that’s the problem. So many kids don’t really realize that they are committing a serious crime that can get them in a lot of trouble. Instead of putting the fire out, everyone decides to stand around it and maybe even jump over it a few times. That is, until the fire department comes and breaks them up.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Now I’m going to tell you a little story that didn’t go so well. I was writing a school paper when I heard fire trucks outside my door. My friends and I walked outside to see the fire department actually driving away from a smoldering fire in the street in front of my house. I later found out that they weren’t abandoning the fire like we thought, they were actually attending to another larger fire that was happening down the street. Stupidly, I decided to go and also play with the fire by throwing some additional things on top of it. I didn’t know that this action, which I had seen other do so many times before, was illegal and helping to fuel a fire.</p>\n<p>I soon realized I was in trouble when a police officer came up to me and grabbed me. I immediately confessed to throwing in additional scraps. However, my honesty was not their concern. I was promptly sat down on the curb and after several questions I was actually arrested. I had to spend 13 and a half hours overnight inside a jail cell. I ended up missing my class and not turning in my paper on time. I didn’t even get to finish it. It’s now been several months since that incident, but the effects that it had have definitely not left my mind. Not only did I have to hire a lawyer, begin community service hours and pay several fines, but I’ve had to go through the mental stress that comes with doing something illegal.</p>\n<p>Even though I wasn’t the one to start the fire, I realized that I had helped make the jobs of firefighters and police that much more difficult. After talking to one of the police officers who drove me to jail, I began to realize how much of an epidemic these fires really were. The officer told me that on an average night they are called in for about 20 fires. That’s now. He told me a few years ago it would reach 50 to 70 fires a night! The fact that police and firefighters have to worry about children setting fires in the street is absurd; they’re supposed to be available to deal with the more serious crimes that many I.V. residents are all too familiar with.</p>\n<p>Luckily I was only given an infraction — similar to a traffic ticket — and had to do community service and pay some fines. However, that only came after months of collecting letters of recommendation and having my lawyer speak with the district attorney several times! Other people are getting misdemeanors or could even face felony charges! Understand that this is serious. Just think about what would happen if one of these fires got out of control and reached a house. I strongly urge anyone who reads my story to take it into consideration when they are out in I.V. Don’t just be a mindless sheep and do something stupid just for the recognition from others. I know that I have learned a lot, and I know that I will never again do something that could ruin my life forever. Don’t make the same mistake. Don’t light couch fires in Isla Vista. Be considerate.</p>\n<p><em>Noah Nevins is a resident of Isla Vista.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
