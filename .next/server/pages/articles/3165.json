Despite having allotted Transportation &amp; Parking Services a $3.33 lock-in fee at the end of last year, the department has recently increased the price of permits.</p>\n<p>In addition to the paying the quarterly lock-in, A.S. Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said students are now expected to contribute an additional $17.50 per quarter to guarantee free night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>“We have to decide where we want to move forward with it,” Elwood said.</p>\n<p>Following a drawn-out discussion, the board decided to form an ad hoc committee to further investigate the matter.</p>\n<p>“What kind of message does this send to parking services if we give in to their demands?” Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said. “Certain questions need to be answered by PTS before we move forward with this discussion.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the board passed a resolution supporting the federal Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, which seeks to provide immigrants greater access to higher education.</p>\n<p>Alfredo del Cid, university owned off-campus housing representative, said it was A.S.’s duty to speak on behalf of those students who pay student fees, but are denied access to financial aid and other services — a problem which the federal bill will address.</p>\n<p>“These undocumented students are part of our university and the people we represent,” del Cid said. “We’re losing them every day because they just can’t afford to keep paying into the system.”</p>\n<p>Board members were unsure about how their resolution would support the legislation, but the council eventually approved the action.</p>\n<p>Nayra Pacheco, a third-year environmental studies and history of public policy major, said the bill’s main purpose is to establish solidarity between students of all backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“Basically, it allows us to say our student government is behind us and supports the D.R.E.A.M. Act,” Pacheco said. “It helps a lot to have your backing, especially if we need posters or other campaign materials. It’s good to have that backing when we go to Finance Board.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/","id":3162,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3161,3160,3159],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Girl Scouts Begin Selling Cookies on UCSB Campus","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Girl-Scouts_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Girl-Scouts_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Local Girl Scouts began selling Girl Scout cookies on campus this month.

The cookie program is also the country’s largest financial investment in girls annually.</p>\n<p>The Girl Scouts recently debuted “Caramel Chocolate Chip” for the 2019 season, accompanying the iconic line-up of Thin Mints, Samoas, Trefoils and more.</p>\n<p>This year, Girl Scouts sell cookies across campus in prime locations near the University Center, Pardall Tunnel and Davidson Library.</p>\n<p>Skyler, a local 13-year-old, set her stand in front of the library last Monday night. She said she has been selling cookies on the UCSB campus for the past two years.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of really enthusiastic people and it’s always a treat to be here,” Skyler said.</p>\n<p>Skyler experimented selling cookies at a variety of locations on campus and decided on the location based on where she found the most people.</p>\n<p>“As it gets later and people start to go to bed, I migrate over there,” Skyler said as she pointed toward the freshmen Chi-5 dorms.</p>\n<p>Thin Mints, Caramel Delights and Peanut Butter Patties are especially popular this year, according to Skyler. This year, Skyler’s goal is to sell 3,000 boxes of cookies.</p>\n<p>Lilly Rodriguez, the sister of two local Girl Scouts, posted on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page offering pre-orders for cookies. Within a day, she received over 50 messages.</p>\n<p>“I enjoy helping my sisters out so they can go on trips with their troop. My older sister is planning on going to San Francisco and my little sister will use the money for activities,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>Many Girl Scouts are now accepting payment through Venmo, a mobile payment app, in an effort to increase sales to college students who may not carry cash.</p>\n<p>Sixth grader Olivia F. is excited by the increased profits from the usage of Venmo.</p>\n<p>“We love Venmo. We took over $1,000 on it at our UCSB cookie booth. Not all troops use it but we think it is a must,” Olivia said.</p>\n<p>“[Students] get very excited when they hear us yell ‘We take Venmo.’”</p>\n<p>Olivia is aiming to sell 500 boxes this year, enticed by the pair of narwhal slippers that she would win as a prize. She is optimistic about where the profits from this year’s sales will go.</p>\n<p>“We are using some of the money to go to Kaleidoscope, a large Girl Scout camping trip at Live Oak Campground. We haven’t voted how to spend the rest but last year we did horseback riding,” Farley said.</p>\n<p>UCSB students welcome the Girl Scouts to campus, as they bring back childhood memories and offer delicious cookies.</p>\n<p>“I was a Girl Scout for many years, and it reminds me of my days of selling cookies,” Anika Ahlstro, first-year communication and art history major, said.</p>\n<p>“The cookies bring me happiness whenever I eat them, especially Thin Mints and Tagalongs.”</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Feb. 10, 1:44 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Ashley Rusch and Amira Garewal are staff writers at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

vote for the special election to be valid, according to Renteria.</p>\n<p>The voting threshold had been lowered for this election to compensate for low voter turnout in the previous Fall Quarter 2018 External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) special election.</p>\n<p>Initially, two students declared candidacy in the special election: Rachel Ng, a fourth-year biological sciences and global studies double major, and Richard Zierer, a fourth-year political science and English double major. However, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/zierer-drops-out-of-evpsa-election-ng-now-running-unopposed/\">Zierer dropped out of the race</a> on Jan. 23, leaving Ng unopposed.</p>\n<p>If the election meets the eight percent threshold by the deadline, Ng will only serve for approximately three months until the winner of the Spring Quarter 2019 election is sworn in.</p>\n<p>If elected, Ng hopes to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ng-is-sole-candidate-remaining-in-evpsa-special-election/#search\">center her agenda</a> around statewide affairs as it concerns sexual assault policy, common sense gun control and reproductive justice.</p>\n<p>This is A.S.’s third attempt to elect an EVPSA since Spring Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>The Fall Quarter special election occurred due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualification of Mayela Morales</a>, a fifth-year global studies and Chicano and Chicana studies double major, in May.</p>\n<p>Morales won the EVPSA position in April, but it was later discovered that she was not enrolled in any classes at UC Santa Barbara during the Spring Quarter, resulting in her subsequent disqualification.</p>\n<p>Madeline Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, was the sole declared candidate in the Fall Quarter special election. During that special election, however, the 16 percent voter threshold was not met and as a result, Loudon was not voted in.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board spent $50 on the Winter Quarter special election, Renteria said at the A.S. Senate meeting last Wednesday, Jan. 30.</p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma is the university news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or simren@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
