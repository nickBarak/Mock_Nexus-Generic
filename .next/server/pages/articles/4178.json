Barthelemy began to curate these objects to preserve them in the weeks following the tragedy for a public exhibit that would be ready by the first anniversary of the tragedy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 10 weeks of exhibition at Old Gym, all of the objects were archived on the Special Collections section of the Davidson Library, located on the third floor. But it wasn’t until this past year that an online collection of the exhibit began to gain momentum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This five-year project culminated this Wednesday with “We Remember Them: Acts of Love and Compassion in Isla Vista,” where the exhibit’s new website was unveiled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://islavistamemorialproject.omeka.net/exhibits/show/werememberthem\">website</a> is a recreation of the original exhibit, meant to be seen room by room, and allows users to search for specific remembrance items with detailed information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lauren Trujillo, a library and information science masters student at UC Los Angeles, played a key role in helping the Isla Vista Memorial Project come to fruition. She first became involved in the project as a second-year student at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Trujillo began working on the project because of her interest in archiving, she also had a personal connection to the Isla Vista tragedy; as a member of Delta Delta Delta, commonly known as Tri Delta, Trujillo was a close friend of victims Katie Cooper and Veronika Weiss. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I] wasn’t sure if that would be too personal for me, but I knew I had to do it. I had to be the voice for my sorority sisters, I had to be the voice for undergraduate students and get our stories straight from what the media had torn apart … so taking it back was something that I could help with this narrative,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past year, Trujillo has been creating a website for the Isla Vista Memorial Project to commemorate the fifth year anniversary and received funding through a year-long grant at UCLA from the Mellon Foundation to do so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trujillo’s aim with the online exhibition was to allow people to access the materials at a time when they were ready to address what was a highly traumatic event, especially for alumni who had been around in 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do know that other students weren’t ready to go through the exhibition yet. They weren’t ready to readdress that trauma again,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted the importance of educating students who weren’t here for the tragedy on how the community came together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can find the details of what happened that day on the Internet, but you can’t find how our community reacted and all the great things that came out of this unspeakable event … for them to see our community’s story and how UCSB and how Gauchos reacted and how we came together can help them understand the campus they belong to and the campus that they are contributing to,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original Isla Vista Memorial Project, as well as its new website, show I.V. in a different light compared to media’s response to the Isla Vista tragedy, Barthelemy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The news just grabs any photo [they] can get, which is whatever happens to be on your Facebook profile at that second. And so, for the families not to be able to choose the photograph they want to represent their loved one is a really big deal,” Barthelemy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This project gave those families the opportunity to choose a picture of their loved one, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can imagine that was really emotional for them to go through photographs and choose one, and it was emotional for us too,” Barthelemy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Isla Vista Memorial Project evolved over the past five years, Barthelemy and Trujillo’s work to memorialize the tragedy has grown. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barthelemy became the official liaison between the university administration and the families of the victims, a position she said is unique to UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But now, Barthelemy said she is ready to hand some of the responsibilities over to UCSB administration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been able to develop really close relationships with the family… [but] I’m going to just be able to focus more on my history work and not so much the administrative stuff, but I want the families to be very well taken care of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Trujillo, continuing work on the Isla Vista Memorial Project was a way to continue healing after the loss of her friends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing that I had to realize was that trauma, you never get over it, and I had to accept that. I’m never going to get over this. So sometimes when I’m working with an object or if I see something and it makes me cry, it’s okay and I can let it out,” Trujillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But then the next day, and another day, I can continue working with these things and feel like I’m doing this for a bigger reason.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annie Platoff, UCSB librarian and Isla Vista Memorial Archive curator, told the audience at the opening of the exhibit on Wednesday night that working on such a personal exhibit has led to a greater political energy for those working on the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can be professional in your daily work with the materials, but we are also people with opinions who read and participate in our community … when I leave the library at night, I’m political,” Platoff said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Trujillo is proud of the work she has done, she said she sometimes harbored guilt about the shootings that have occurred since Isla Vista’s own tragedy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt guilty that we could have done more in 2014, and [I] should have gone out and started speaking and done more to make them stop happening,” Trujillo said. “Hopefully by sharing this online exhibition and by sharing these items in a university space, we can start conversations and we can inspire action of some sort … [these shootings] need to stop and it’s been re-traumatizing every time another community’s affected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m blessed for what I’ve been able to do, but I do feel the sense to do more.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heather Carr contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

In those six games they were outscored 43-20.</p>\n<p>Being away from home is usually enough to get UCSB off its game, as it only has an 8-11-1 record; however, a close 4-3 win at UCLA this past Tuesday might have come at just the right moment so that it can go into the UCI game with some confidence.</p>\n<p>Since 2002, the Gauchos have struggled immensely against the Anteaters posting a 14-28 record. It also does not help that Santa Barbara has not won a series at UC Irvine since 1986, but will definitely look to change that this year as its playoff lives depend on it.</p>\n<p>As most of these conference series go, the home team usually holds the advantage in terms of winning, as the past has consistently shown. Last season, UCSB swept UCI at home; two of wins had only one-run differences. However, two years ago when the series was at the Anteaters’ home, they swept the Gauchos in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>UCI will rely on its batting success to get it through this series, as it currently boasts the top batting average (.280), the top on-base percentage (.363) and the second best slugging percentage (.374) in the conference.</p>\n<p>One big factor in that is sophomore Keston Hiura, who has a .382 batting average, third best in the Big West. His home runs (seven) and RBI’s (37) are also third best in the conference, while his slugging percentage (.580) is the best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s success in road games usually comes down to how the young pitching staff reacts to the pressure of the large road crowds. In their 20 road games this season, the pitching staff has allowed 91 earned runs compared to only 96 earned runs at home through 26 games.</p>\n<p>This month in particular, the inexperience and lack of depth has really shown itself, as the pitching staff has a combined 5.52 ERA, 54 earned runs and has allowed six home runs through 10 games. In the month of April, the throwing rotation had a 3.38 ERA, 53 earned runs and only four home runs allowed in 16 games.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the return of two solid pitchers from injury, redshirt junior James Carter and redshirt senior Justin Kelly, can help the struggling rotation. In his three appearances since his Tommy John surgery, Carter has been pitching five solid innings, allowing only five hits and no runs while striking out two batters.</p>\n<p>Kelly has also been solid as in 5.1 innings pitched he has allowed one run and four hits while striking out seven batters.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be no easy task for the Gauchos, but it certainly is necessary if they want to make a run at the postseason. They also need to get back to their winning ways so that if they make the postseason they can do more than just be one and done.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UCI at Cicerone Field on Friday, May 20 at 6:30 p.m., Saturday, May 21 at 7 p.m. and Sunday, May 22 at 6 p.m. Saturday’s game will be live-broadcasted on Fox Sports Prime Ticket while Sunday’s will be live on ESPNU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

In the fourth inning, the Gauchos were finally able to get on the board after a Kyle Plantier RBI single that brought them within four runs.</p>\n<p>After three more scoreless innings in the fifth, sixth and seventh, Bush finally struck in the eighth inning, hitting a grand slam to center field and tying the game up at five apiece. It was the first baseman’s seventh home run of the season and the first four-RBI homer of his young career.</p>\n<p>In the final frame, redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover drove in the leading run, redshirt sophomore JJ Muno, for the Gauchos first lead of the game. It was Bush who struck yet again as he drove in three more runs with a double to left center, scoring Grover, redshirt junior Devon Gradford and redshirt sophomore Clay Fisher, making the score 9-5 in favor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>That would end up being the final score of Sunday’s game after redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson picked up his seventh win of the season, bouncing back from a tough loss the previous night as he struck out two of the last three batters.</p>\n<p>Bush also became the first Gaucho to have a seven-RBI game in nearly 10 years as now UCSB assistant coach Chris Valaika hit seven against UC Davis on May 21, 2006.</p>\n<p>Before clinching a tough road series victory, Santa Barbara suffered a heartbreaking 5-4 loss that came down to the final pitch and a throw from Muno that was just off.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were up 3-0 early after scoring two runs in the second and one run in the top of the third frame before UCI countered with three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning courtesy of sophomore infielder Cole Kreuter’s two-RBI triple and redshirt senior infielder Grant Palmer’s RBI sac fly.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters then took the lead after junior Adam Alcantara drove in a run to make the score 4-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB tied the game in the seventh inning thanks to redshirt junior Andrew Calica’s bunt, which scored Tevin Mitchell after a throwing error by the UCI pitcher.</p>\n<p>After two scoreless innings, UC Irvine had a chance to win the game in regular innings as it had the final opportunity in the bottom of the ninth. After loading the bases thanks to a single, a walk and a hit batter, Alcantara had a chance to drive in the winning run to go home winners or hit into a double play that would end the inning.</p>\n<p>The junior decided to go with the former and drove in John Brontsema to secure the 5-4 win. That, however, does not mean the play was not dramatic. Alcantara hit a line drive to left field, where third baseman Muno snagged it on a beautiful dive.</p>\n<p>Then an off-balance Muno tried to throw the ball to home plate to get the runner out but it was a bit out of the catcher’s reach and Brontsema was able to score.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLt1BhfzgbsF30dnjYcB4kmrtryqjRQ4U1&amp;hl=en_US\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>It was a heartbreaker for the Gauchos and for Nelson, who picked up his second loss in less than a week after starting the season with a perfect 6-0 record. However, the right-hander was able to bounce back in Sunday’s game, proving why he is on the watch list for the top pitcher in the country.</p>\n<p>Before that gut-wrenching loss, UCSB was able to start the series off the right way and pick up a solid 10-3 victory to set the tone for the rest of the matches.</p>\n<p>The scoring began in the top of the third, where UCSB picked up three runs thanks to Muno’s RBI single and Grover’s two-RBI single. UCI countered in the bottom of the frame with one run courtesy of Alcantara’s RBI single, making the score 3-1 after three innings.</p>\n<p>Both teams scored two runs in the fourth inning to keep the lead the same for the Gauchos now at 5-3.  In the sixth, UCSB extended its lead by adding a run thanks to Mitchell’s RBI single.</p>\n<p>In the seventh, Santa Barbara really did some damage, capitalizing on an error by UCI to score one run and a balk by the pitcher which scored another run, making the score 8-3.</p>\n<p>Calica would drive in the final two runs in the same inning thanks to a single to right field, making the score 10-3. Both teams were unable to score after that, making the final score 10-3 in favor of the road team.</p>\n<p>Junior Shane Bieber had another solid day at the office, allowing 11 hits and three earned runs but striking out 10 batters while pitching his fourth complete game of the season. Bieber (10-3) is now only the 12th pitcher in Gaucho history to reach 10 wins on the season.</p>\n<p>It was a solid weekend overall for UCSB, whose season is coming to a close. It was a great way to end its average road record while also helping them pick up momentum as the playoffs approach.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next game is at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium against Gonzaga at 3 p.m. on Monday, May 23.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
