This afternoon the Gauchos will hit the road to take on No. 11 UCLA. The two teams locked up previously this year back on Feb. 26, when the Bruins crushed the Gauchos 12-3.</p>\n<p>With the season nearing the end, every game counts; the Gauchos, sitting at 31-22 and 14-10 in the Big West Conference, need each and every win.</p>\n<p>“UCLA is a big game for us,” senior third baseman Marc Venning said. “It’s a chance to raise our RPI potentially and hopefully get us a regional bid.

This is the final home game for the Bruins in the regular season, where they are 23-9 on their home field. Despite their stellar record, however, UCLA has lost its last two matchups with Big West opponents.</p>\n<p>On May 7, Cal State Northridge defeated the Bruins in Los Angeles 4-1, and on May 14, Cal State Fullerton, the No. 1 team in the Big West, defeated UCLA 5-2. Excluding those two losses to Big West opponents, UCLA has crushed its competition in the Pac 12 as of late.</p>\n<p>The Bruins have swept their last three series against conference opponents, defeating USC, Arizona and Utah the last three weekends and have gone on to now win six consecutive weekend series.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are seemingly just as hot. UCSB has won its last five weekend series with Big West opponents, the last coming against Pacific this last weekend.</p>\n<p>Today in Los Angeles, freshman pitcher Justin Jacome is slated to take the mound. Jacome, in his last outing, returned from a severe ankle sprain and impressed. He threw six-and-a-third strong innings, allowing just one run on seven hits, earning his fifth victory this season.</p>\n<p>“This is a big game for us,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We’ve got Jacome going and probably we will see some of our other regular weekend starters available, too, since it’s like do or die at this point.”</p>\n<p>Backing Jacome will be a Gaucho offense that has found its stride after some lineup tweaks. The supporting cast around standouts junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa have really begun to produce.</p>\n<p>Junior left fielder Joey Epperson has taken hold of the leadoff position and is hitting .320 since April 16, scoring 18 runs over that 19 game span.</p>\n<p>Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell, who Epperson replaced at the top of the order, has also thrived moving into the more RBI friendly positions around the five hole. Newell is hitting .425 since April 16 and has driven in 12 runs.</p>\n<p>The new number three hitter in the lineup, sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward, has also seen his production increase. Since April 16, he is hitting .307 with 12 runs scored and 17 RBI.</p>\n<p>Epperson, Newell and Woodward also have all had hitting streaks of 13, 12 and 13 games respectively over the last month, a large reason the team has seen such success as of late.</p>\n<p>The hot-hitting Gauchos will be at Jackie Robinson Stadium tonight with first pitch against UCLA set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magali-Gauthier-Baseball.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1854044175\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51457\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51458\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-21/confident-gauchos-face-no-11-ucla/magali-gauthier-baseball/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magali-Gauthier-Baseball.jpg?fit=3456%2C5184&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3456,5184\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1361899973\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"190\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Magali Gauthier Baseball\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magali-Gauthier-Baseball.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magali-Gauthier-Baseball.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51458\" alt=\"Magali Gauthier Baseball\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magali-Gauthier-Baseball-166x250.jpg?resize=166%2C250\" width=\"166\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 21, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The bluff was a communal backyard for the nine units on 6653 Del Playa Drive, known as The Oasis housing.</p>\n<p>After emergency personnel <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-22/balcony-collapses-on-6653-del-playa-drive/\" target=\"_blank\">responded to the sudden collapse</a> Sunday, a Santa Barbara County building inspector determined that Units 1, 4, 5 and 9 would be evacuated to preserve the residents’ safety.</p>\n<p>Though the foundation of the building was unharmed, the four ocean-facing units were evacuated in preparation for emergency demolition — the first of many steps to scale back the Del Playa property before future cliff erosion.</p>\n<p>James Gelb, owner of Del Playa Rentals, purchased the building from Ed St. George in 1992. It was built in the early ‘70s and is among 38 buildings leased by the rental group.</p>\n<p>“None of my other properties are in any danger at all,” Gelb told the <em>Nexus</em>. “This was a total fluke.”</p>\n<p>The bluff collapsed on the day of a heavy storm, and though there was no damage to the actual residence, Del Playa Rentals returned the evacuated residents’ security deposits, last month’s rent and partial January rent.</p>\n<p>Residents were initially given until Friday to find new housing, but Gelb told the <em>Nexus</em> Wednesday that the county Building &amp; Safety Department red-tagged the units for Thursday, giving students one less day to relocate.</p>\n<p>No one was injured in the bluff collapse, but “if anyone was going to be hurt on that patio, it would have been me,” Gelb said, adding that he conducts very frequent inspections of all of his housing units.</p>\n<p>Currently, Gelb has filed an emergency demolition permit for the evacuated units. Santa Barbara County will approve the permit, and Gelb said County Building &amp; Safety Manager Massoud Abolhoda intends to expedite the process.</p>\n<p>The Building &amp; Safety Department is responsible for approving the permit within 30 days, and Gelb said he will continue to cut back his properties to account for future deterioration of the I.V. cliffside.</p>\n<p>The entire Del Playa bluff is vulnerable to erosion, Abolhoda said, and the county conducts inspections of the rock face after every major storm.</p>\n<p>The last building inspection was in August, and though the county knows the “setback of every building” in Isla Vista, Abolhoda said events like Sunday’s emergency could not be predicted.</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing you can do to avoid it,” he said, adding that there are inherent risks to living on cliffs in I.V. The county could not determine exactly how much of the Del Playa backyard fell into the ocean, but it is estimated to be more than five feet.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75253\" style=\"width: 686px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1883960290\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75245\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75253\" data-attachment-id=\"75253\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/2017-01-23_stephenmanga_6653dp-6-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?fit=676%2C784&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"676,784\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?fit=216%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?fit=676%2C784&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75253\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?resize=676%2C784\" alt=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"784\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?w=676&amp;ssl=1 676w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017.01.23_StephenManga_6653DP-6-2.jpg?resize=216%2C250&amp;ssl=1 216w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Exposed rounded concrete cement poles in a house adjacent to the balcony collapse reveal the extent of cliffside erosion on Del Playa Dr. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Del-Play-Bluff-Policy-Revised-February-2016-2-1.docx\" target=\"_blank\">county figures</a>, the rate of I.V.’s bluff erosion is “a source of debate,” but the bluff is retreating on average six inches a year.

The foundation of the building was unaffected by the bluff collapse, Gelb said, adding that resident allegations saying the foundation had cracks in recent months were unfounded.</p>\n<p>In the past year, Gelb said he has cut back 15 of his residences to prevent damage and injury from future cliff erosion. “I’ve done everything proactively,” he said, adding that other landlords in I.V. have also begun replacing oceanside units further back from the cliff.</p>\n<p>Students who were evacuated from 6653 Del Playa Drive will be forced to find alternate housing by Thursday, and others are still shaken from what they described as the sounds of a “massive earthquake” on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Several former residents who were contacted by the <em>Nexus</em> throughout the week were unable to respond, saying they were in the process of moving furniture, belongings and signing leases for new housing.</p>\n<p>UCSB is offering housing in Tropicana Student Living for up to two groups of seven students, and the off-campus apartment complex also has room for individual students.  The University will not be covering the housing costs, but the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships may be able to provide emergency grants or loans.</p>\n<p>“It seems that both the university and Tropicana each have enough space to accommodate all of the displaced students, so there should be no difficulty for any of these students in quickly finding alternative places to live,” Andrea Estrada, UCSB’s spokesperson, said.</p>\n<p>Several former Del Playa residents are searching for non-university housing in I.V., and the street-facing units are still occupied.</p>\n<p>According to Abolhoda, the street-facing units are “as safe as any other building anywhere else,” barring an emergency situation like an earthquake.</p>\n<p>The former residents will be safe entering their homes to retrieve their belongings, Abolhoda said, but residents at Unit 9 will not be able to enter the home due to a staircase that was compromised after the bluff collapse.</p>\n<p>Robin Unander, lawyer for the I.V. Tenant’s Union (IVTU), said the “situation is still evolving” daily with information from Del Playa Rentals. Unander said it is too early to determine if there is any legal ground for a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>“There is not a lot of other compensation that they would be entitled to at this point, and we need to see where all of the dust settles,” she said.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Senate also discussed a resolution in support of the displaced residents, asking that IVTU provide up to $300 per student for moving costs and ensure that the students have legal representation.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75245\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75245\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/","id":4464,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4463,4462,4461],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Woman Sexually Assaulted on Estero Road","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ivfp.jpg?resize=300%2C225&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ivfp.jpg?resize=300%2C225&ssl=1","description":"A woman was reportedly sexually assaulted in Isla Vista on Saturday, according to a university crime alert Sunday from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A woman was reportedly sexually assaulted in Isla Vista on Saturday, according to a university crime alert Sunday from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police said the assault occurred when a woman who was lost walked into a residence on the 6700 block of Estero Road Saturday afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to police, a male subject assaulted a woman at the residence that afternoon between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The woman was able to leave with the help of some friends, police said, and she reported the sexual assault to the I.V.
