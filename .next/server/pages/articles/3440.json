Villanueva said the president’s executive order and DACA have provided her with opportunities that might have not otherwise been available to an undocumented student.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of people who advocated tirelessly for [Obama’s executive order] including myself and a lot of people I know,” Villanueva said. “DACA has been great for me because I can get a job now and it makes it a lot easier for me to get involved in advocating for the immigrant community.”</p>\n<p>But Villanueva said the new immigration policy still leaves her fearing for her parents, worrying whether or not they will be deported.</p>\n<p>“It won’t really change much for me because my parents won’t be safe from deportations,” Villanueva said. “They will still be vulnerable because local enforcement will still be collaborating with [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement], and the detention and deportation quotas have not changed under this new executive order.”</p>\n<p>According to Villanueva, the executive order’s inability to provide protection to the remainder of Isla Vista’s undocumented population is a reflection of the continuing inadequacy of immigration policy.</p>\n<p>“I know a lot of folks who don’t qualify for [DACA] for a lot of different reasons,” Villanueva said. “For me, that highlights how much our community is still in danger of unjust detention and deportation.”</p>\n<p>Adriana, a third-year English major and undocumented student whose name has been changed on condition of anonymity, said she would stress constantly over the possibility of being deported before she applied for DACA. Adriana said she remembers the fear she felt in one situation when she had a run-in with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.) while traveling from Arizona to Los Angeles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59047\" style=\"width: 343px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59047\" data-attachment-id=\"59047\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12-04-2014-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=2832%2C4256&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2832,4256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1417639606\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"19\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0769230769231\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"undocumented by kenneth song for 12.04.2014 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?fit=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59047\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1-681x1024.jpg?resize=333%2C500\" alt=\"undocumented by kenneth song for 12.04.2014 1\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?resize=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 681w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/undocumented-by-kenneth-song-for-12.04.2014-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Many undocumented students struggle with fear of deportation and finding work, but DACA may allow them to breathe easier — at least for the remainder of Obama’s term. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I was so scared when that happened,” Adriana said. “But luckily the immigration officer was nice. He let us go because I told him I was returning home.”<br>\nAccording to Adriana, since applying to DACA she no longer worries about being deported and is able to live her life more freely by going to school, working a job and traveling without fear.</p>\n<p>“I can come out of the shadows,” Adriana said. “I’m not afraid to travel and I’ve been traveling back and forth from Isla Vista to Los Angeles.”</p>\n<p>Oscar Zarate, a second-year economics and political science major and an undocumented student, said his status has made it difficult for him to afford college because of his limited eligibility to scholarships and financial aid. According to Zarate, he can now obtain the work permit necessary to find a job to help pay for a postsecondary education as a result of Obama’s executive order.</p>\n<p>“Due to Obama’s new immigration policies, I can work which is a big help,” Zarate said. “Now I can be a desk attendant, and that helps a lot with college expenses.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Martinez, a second-year sociology and math major and an undocumented student, said she sees the extension of DACA eligibility and work permit opportunities as positive, but still worries because the added protection for undocumented immigrants will only last for the remaining two years of Obama’s presidency.</p>\n<p>“Obama’s presidency is slowly coming to an end, so there is still that concern of what is going to happen when a new president comes into office,” Martinez said. “I don’t know what kind of legislation the new president will try to implement.”</p>\n<p>Zarate said he also shares the concern that Obama’s new immigration orders are only temporary.</p>\n<p>“These immigration policies that have been applied are not forever,” Zarate said. “I fear for the future of the undocumented student.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, December 4, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59045\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59045\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/undocumented-unafraid/","id":3440,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3439,3438,3437],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz","biography":"Not available","articles":[2355,2371,2376,2377,2406,2411,2412,2418,2420,2422,2427,2435,2450,2451,2459,2498,2505,2509,2556,2577,2605,2624,2691,2696,2713,2716,2717,2742,2771,2848,2858,2874,2907,2941,2951,3440,3458,3600,3602,3629,3742,3743,3747,3864,3904,3953,3956,4139,4421,4428,4447,4459,4480,4484,4490,4500,4507,4508,4509,4575,4587,4589,4598,4603,4618,4621,4627,4628,4632,4641,4646,4648,4651,4653,4661,4663,4675,4705,4745,4765,4773,4778,4815],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

President Ali Guthy expressed concerns about the structure and operation regarding the OSA.</p>\n<p>“The concern regarding the current structure and operation of the office was ultimately this: if the Student Advocate General is meant to advocate for the entire student body as a whole, how can the elected individual, properly advocate for the rights of the whole student body when only dealing with on-campus issues such as plagiarism and dormitory write-ups?” Garcia said in an email.</p>\n<p>Guthy said that while the OSA conducts specific casework for individual students who encounter disciplinary problems on campus, there could be a better way to serve all students.</p>\n<p>“This type of individualized service is not offered by any other elected executive officer or their staff, considering there are alternative structures within the association that serve to facilitate this need,” Guthy said in an email. “As executives, I believe it is the responsibility of our offices and ourselves to advocate for all UCSB students as opposed to assisting with individual cases because we are elected by the entire student body.”</p>\n<p>Second-year CC] literature major, SAG candidate and current OSA outreach coordinator Ethan Reul said that without casework, the OSA would operate like an “umbrella” for other advocacy groups and would be saddled with additional responsibilities.</p>\n<p>“The SAG would then be responsible for the oversight and management of all these advocacy groups as well as kind of advocating on a more university-wide level as opposed to just the on-campus issues that the OSA currently deals with,” Reul said.</p>\n<p>Guthy also said this new CSA unit would settle in with other advocacy units on campus and broaden the spectrum of student support, which already includes the Legal Resource Center and the Isla Vista Tenants Union.</p>\n<p>“The new unit this bill seeks to create, Campus Student Advocacy (CSA), will fit perfectly within this structure as the CSA would conduct casework to assist students who receive on-campus violations,” Guthy said in an email. “The formation of the CSA would create a holistic approach and structure for advocacy in associated students, as the ‘Advocacy Units’ would now address housing issues, off-campus issues, and on-campus issues.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, this bill would better serve students because it would provide a more cohesive relationship among groups on campus striving to help students.</p>\n<p>“For me, the biggest reason is that this bill proposes a new model that will facilitate a more positive, synchronized relationship between the SAG and now multiple advocacy groups, specializing in different aspects of student rights,” Guthy said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year CCS literature major and former SAG Bailey Loverin said the new bill could take the OSA “five steps backwards” from when it was previously restructured.</p>\n<p>“The new unit will not have the administrative clout of the OSA under the SAG, the SAG will be reduced to a figurehead position, confidentiality could be seriously compromised, you can’t guarantee non-partisan chairs so students could feel unsafe going to the unit, you can’t force them to attend office hours and meetings, the list goes on,” Loverin said in an email.</p>\n<p>Reul said Guthy had initially brought the bill to the OSA, but after the OSA decided not to split the office, Guthy went ahead and presented the bill to the senate. While there was some debate between the two, it ultimately met with compromise.</p>\n<p>“Ali went ahead and decided that she wanted to present it to senate anyway. Technically, it was a professional courtesy that she brought it to us; she did not need to,” Reul said. “However, because she did, we were kind of put off by the fact that she went ahead and did it anyway. So we kind of got into a bit of a heated argument with her and we came to the compromise of postponing, rather than completely eliminating or going through with the bill.”</p>\n<p>Reul said he would support the bill if it were more closely examined and revised, particularly after a new SAG is elected.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping that when we do have a Student Advocate General, [they] work more closely with Ali on the creation of this bill so that way when it finally does go through, it’s in the best interest of Associated Students and the student body as a whole,” Reul said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Attorney General Hector Contreras said the bill in its current form could be deemed unconstitutional according to the A.S. Legal Code and that it would be best to wait until a new SAG is elected before going forward with the bill.</p>\n<p>“If the bill were to be passed as it is now, under my interpretation it would be unconstitutional because it is preventing the Student Advocate General from providing oversight and direction to their office as there is no current elected SAG,” Contreras said in an email.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57926\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57926\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/a-s-bill-seeks-to-restructure-student-advocacy/","id":3437,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[3436,3435,3434],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2014 Midterm Election Results: Capps, Williams Re-elected, GOP Takes Senate","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Santa Barbara County Clerk-Recorder’s Office released its final numbers shortly after 11:30p.m. on election day yesterday evening, posting results for state, federal, and local contests relevant...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57922\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57922\" data-attachment-id=\"57922\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/election-day-by-anna-kodelashvili_for-11-04-2014w-5758/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=1200%2C798&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,798\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415125289\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.04\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Election Day by Anna Kodelashvili_for 11.04.2014w-5758\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57922\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Election-Day-by-Anna-Kodelashvili_for-11.04.2014w-5758-1024x680.jpg?resize=500%2C333\" alt=\"Lois Capps, who has retained her seat in the House of Representatives, visited campus yesterday to urge students to vote.

Prop 47, which passed with 58.4 percent of the vote, reduced the penalties for certain drug crimes from felonies to misdemeanors.</p>\n<p>Proposition 45, which requires the state’s Insurance Commissioner’s approval before a health insurer can change its rates, failed to get more than 40.1 percent of the vote. Proposition 46, which required drug testing for physicians, also went down with 67.2 percent of voters saying no.</p>\n<p>In national elections, the Republicans picked up seven seats in the U.S. Senate, gaining a majority in that house for the party for the first time since 2007.

each year and would result in baseline UC tuition totaling $15,564 per student per year by the 2019-2020 academic year.</p></div>\n<p>The UC Office of the President and UC Board of Regents announced today that the Board would consider a plan to incrementally increase tuition by five percent annually for five years at its bi-monthly meeting on Nov 19.</p>\n<p>The plan assumes that the state will increase its base budget support for UC by four percent annually through the 2019-2020 academic year, contributions that will amount to roughly 1.7 percent of the UC’s annual budget.</p>\n<p>A UCOP statement stated that the proposed five percent annual increase is a “ceiling figure” and that the entire proposal hinges on the amount of money appropriated to the UC budget by Sacramento. According to UCOP, the plan stipulates each five percent increase would equate to roughly $500 more in additional charges each year and would result in baseline UC tuition totaling $15,564 per student per year by the 2019-2020 academic year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCOP listed various reasons for the tuition increase in its initial statement on the proposal.

University of California students have been ready, willing, and urging the UC to let students be a part of planning for their future.”</p>\n<p>Napolitano, when asked about the statement, said continuing a tuition freeze with current levels of state support, which she said has declined over the last decade by 27 percent per student, is not feasible.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s unfortunate language. It’s not that at all,” Napolitano said. “It’s not holding anybody hostage, this is where we are … but you can’t have a tuition freeze indefinitely at the current level of state support that we’re receiving.”</p>\n<p>According to Napolitano, given the “dramatically reduced” per student contribution by the state, the UC has been placed in a situation that necessitates a tuition increase or an increase in state funding.</p>\n<p>“The per-student contribution by the state has really been dramatically reduced. I think it’s time to say, ‘Look, we want to maintain ourself as open and accessible, maintain our student aid policy; we want to increase California enrollment and we need to invest in academic quality.’” Napolitano said. “At some point you either increase the state contribution or you have a tuition plan that goes into place.”</p>\n<p>All 10 UC chancellors, including Chancellor Henry T. Yang, also released a joint statement today in support of the proposed increase, citing continuous funding gaps and a decreased budget of $640 million in funds available to UC since 2008.</p>\n<p>“The plan addresses our obligation to students and their families to provide them with the best education possible at the most affordable price. It is predictable and fair, and it allows families to plan ahead,” the statement reads. “It is important to note that under this proposed plan, about 55 percent of our California undergraduates will continue to pay no systemwide tuition or fees.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58059\" style=\"width: 294px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1855482660\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58030\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58059\" data-attachment-id=\"58059\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucop-to-consider-tuition-increases/ucsa-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?fit=800%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,680\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?fit=250%2C213&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?fit=800%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58059\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?resize=284%2C241\" alt=\"University of California Student Association released a statement yesterday condemning the proposed tuition increase, claiming as a step that it holds students' education &quot;hostage.&quot;\" width=\"284\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?resize=250%2C213&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58059\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">University of California Student Association released a statement yesterday condemning the proposed tuition increase, claiming as a step that it holds students’ education “hostage.”</p></div>\n<p>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, the UC’s largest workers union, released a statement on the proposed tuition increase, claiming that UCOP has twice the number of employees earning over $250,000 per year now as it did in 2008.
