Law enforcement officials are currently investigating whether the disturbance was drug related.</p>\n<p>According to the report, both victims sustained what is “characterized to be gunshot wounds” from a handgun found at the scene. Both victims are being treated at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and are expected to recover from their injuries. The third patient at the hospital was confirmed to be Taylor, who sustained head wounds from the incident that do not appear to be life threatening.</p>\n<p>A short while after the altercation on Sabado Tarde, a Hispanic male arrived at Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital with injuries he claimed were sustained during a vehicle accident on the UCSB campus. The man was transferred to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital due to the nature of his injuries and confirmed to be Gutierrez.</p>\n<p>Both Taylor and Guitierrez are under police custody but will remain in the hospital due to their injuries until they can be released. Taylor is booked on charges of Attempted Murder, Robbery, Discharge of a firearm in the commission of a felony causing great bodily injury, and Participation in a Criminal Street Gang. Gutierrez is booked on charges of Attempted Murder, Robbery, Possession of a Stolen Firearm, Participating in a Criminal Street Gang and Discharge of a firearm in the commission of a felony causing great bodily injury.</p>\n<p>SBCSO Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said the shooting “triggers” emotions given the one-year anniversary of the events of <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1765064422\"><span class=\"aQJ\">May 23</span></span> is less than two weeks away.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, everybody out here right now is very sensitive right now, coming on heels of the one-year anniversary, just the thought of anyone being injured out here in Isla Vista, I think, just makes everyone’s heart sink,” Hoover said. “So there is definitely great concern on behalf of the public. We’re getting lots of calls — a lot of people very, very worried.”</p>\n<p>Hoover said while it is uncertain whether <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1765064423\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Monday’s</span></span> shooting is connected to the three armed robberies that took place last week, law enforcement has reason to believe there is a connection between the robberies that occurred on May 3 and May 4.</p>\n<p>“At this point, that is all under investigation. It’s likely there is a relation between definitely the alleged victim, who also later was arrested,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated as of 6:39 p.m. on May 12, 2015.</em></p>\n<div

members voted to delay a decision to endorse Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) during the Goleta City Council special session meeting Tuesday until the next regularly scheduled city council meeting on ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Committee members were not able to come to a consensus on the endorsement of Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) during the Goleta City Council special session meeting Tuesday and no further has discussion has been scheduled.</p>\n<p>The office of Assemblyman Das Williams and the Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative are currently hosting the Week of AB 3, a week-long series of events to inform students and residents of AB 3 before the bill goes the California State Assembly Committee on Local Government next Wednesday. As part of this series, UC Santa Barbara students, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) students and Goleta and Isla Vista residents attended the City Council meeting with the intent of securing a council endorsement for AB 3.</p>\n<p>Williams introduced AB 3 in December 2014 to propose establishing I.V. as a community services district (CSD) to address the lack of self-governance in Isla Vista. A CSD would be funded by local taxes and improve local infrastructure and public services. The Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is a state-mandated agency that oversees the formation of CSDs, however the I.V. CSD would bypass the LAFCO formation process by act of the state legislature.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We can’t continue being unincorporated and keep the status quo, because the status quo has shown to be disastrous. – Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee Jonathan Abboud</p></blockquote>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said establishing a CSD is necessary to address the issues facing I.V.</p>\n<p>“We can’t continue being unincorporated and keep the status quo, because the status quo has shown to be disastrous,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Associated Students off-campus senator and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez said a CSD would provide residents the opportunity to voice the community’s needs and to change I.V.’s reputation.</p>\n<p>“AB 3 is the best chance we have to have Isla Visa take control of itself and in a responsible way turn things that are difficulties now into benefits, to turn the reputation of Isla Vista into a boon for the entire area,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>LAFCO commissioner and California Special Districts Association president Craig Geyer said the bill bypasses the LAFCO formation process and should not be included in the Goleta city agenda.<br>\n“The funding source is usually utility tax which is reserved for cities and counties,” Geyer said. “Speaking as a resident of Goleta, I don’t think Goleta has a stick in this fire.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>At this point a lot of the information we’ve asked for to make a decision has not been brought forward. We need evidence of a future funding mechanism to go forward with this. – Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar</p></blockquote>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double major Cameron Schunk said the discussion on the financial feasibility report outlining the expenses of a CSD is unrelated to the current passage of the bill to committee. Schunk also said LAFCO “continuously misrepresents facts” regarding details of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“Consistently property owners, long-term I.V. residents and other groups have been undermining the passage of the self-governance movement and AB 3,” Schunk said. “To say that AB 3 isn’t self-governance while recommending the existing power structures maintain control is not only disingenuous but also misleading.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said the LAFCO process of discussing financial aspects of a CSD is “crucial” in making the decision to endorse a bill.</p>\n<p>“At this point a lot of the information we’ve asked for to make a decision has not been brought forward,” Soutar said. “We need evidence of a future funding mechanism to go forward with this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB economics professor Lanny Ebenstein said creating a CSD is a long overdue step, as shown by recent tragic events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was tragedy in many respects that led to this proposal coming forward,” Ebenstein said. “It was the clear evidence that the current government structure for Isla Vista is not working.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>By excluding I.V. from the Goleta center boundaries, an orphan was created. – Longtime resident Bruce Murdoch</p></blockquote>\n<p>Longtime resident Bruce Murdoch said Goleta should not partake in the CSD except to address issues of safety, such as establishing ordinances for Deltopia and Halloween weekends. According to Murdoch, these specific ordinances are county-wide and can be executed from within Goleta without the need for a CSD.</p>\n<p>“By excluding I.V. from the Goleta center boundaries, an orphan was created,” Murdoch said. “If I.V. was part of Goleta then specific unique ordinances could be drafted to solve these specific unique problems.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, conversations on the CSD’s financial feasibility will not be relevant for months to come and have distracted from the discussion on endorsement of the bill.</p>\n<p>“We will need the feasibility study to determine the rate of the tax but we won’t be determining the rate for maybe another year,” Abboud said. “The CSD law says you’re allowed to have a laundry list of taxes that can be specified later, it’s not important to the fast-paced process of the bill right now.”</p>\n<p>Goleta City councilmember Michael T. Bennett said AB 3 is not perfect, but I.V. issues are intrinsically tied to Goleta city issues and should be supported by the council. Bennett said the effectiveness of the I.V. Recreation and Parks Department suggests a CSD that includes students and long-term residents could be successful.</p>\n<p>“I think as a beginning point it’s an opportunity for people to determine their own destiny,” Bennett said. “What gives me the most faith that it can actually work is, in fact, the Parks and Rec Department. When that was proposed there were many naysayers … but it has succeeded way beyond anyone’s expectation and has shown that it can work with students and those that are residents with the community.”</p>\n<p>After the discussion, committee members took a group vote to postpone the discussion to May 19 to discuss the matter with Mayor Paula Perotte, who could not attend the meeting due to sickness. The motion failed and the committee adjourned to regular meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>*This is an updated version of this article.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63107\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63107\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/goleta-reaches-no-decision-on-ab-3-endorsement/","id":4699,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4698,4697,4696],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Guerry Awards Honor Efforts of Community Police","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GUERRY-Cheryl-Sun-e1430993756114.jpg?resize=350%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GUERRY-Cheryl-Sun-e1430993756114.jpg?resize=350%2C280&ssl=1","description":"For their responses to the events of May 23 last year, Santa Barbara Co.

Sheriff’s Department (SBCSO) deputies and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) officers were commended at the 46th annual H. Thomas Guerry Awards Ceremony in the Santa Barbara County Administration Building Wednesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Five SBCSO deputies and three UCPD officers were awarded the H. Thomas Guerry Award for valor at the ceremony and several other local law enforcement officials were also celebrated for superior performance. The prestigious award is named after former Santa Barbara police detective H. Thomas Guerry, who was shot and killed in 1970 by two suspects attempting to rob a bar downtown.</p>\n<p>UCPD Corporal Gregory Pierce said despite the unfortunate circumstances, he is honored to attend the ceremony and hopes to bridge an understanding between the community and the police.</p>\n<p>“We’re all honored to be here, but it’s an unfortunate reason that we’re all standing here,” Pierce said. “But taking a positive attitude, building a relationship with the community and understanding what we do on a daily basis, what we’re capable of doing kind of put some closure to this event for the law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>UCPD sergeant Dan Wilson said community members should take preventative measures and reach out to the police if they have mental health concerns about someone.</p>\n<p>“We really need to work on the mental health aspect in our community, because that’s an epidemic that’s really facing our country right now,” Wilson said. “Usually somebody knows something before it happens, but they fail to report it. And, unfortunately, we’re unable to prevent that from happening.”</p>\n<p>According to Pierce, events such as Pizza with Police, Coffee with Cops and UCSB residence hall programs are a good start to communicating with residents and students.</p>\n<p>“I know that our agency at UCSB tends to do a lot more community outreach,” Pierce said. “We have the res hall liaison program, where officers are assigned to those res halls and they provide information and talks on how to be safe in Isla Vista. That’s definitely one that helps us build those relationships.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said Pizza with Police is important because it “allows [the police] to be human” and allows the community feel more relaxed around cops.</p>\n<p>“They get to know us by name and they can actually feel comfortable approaching us, and that’s kind of breaking down those barriers because a lot of times, people don’t feel comfortable [so] they’re not going to say anything,” Wilson said. “A lot more students are approaching police officers and having a relationship and talking and you can see it by them saying thank you.”</p>\n<p>According to UCPD Corporal Bradley Prows, open communication must be ensured in I.V. because the police exist to serve the public.</p>\n<p>“We are there to serve them so you have to have an open dialogue back and forth that is a healthy exchange of ideas,” Prows said. “I mean if an officer were to tell you they aren’t interested in what you have to say, you’re looking at a fool.”</p>\n<p>Prows said Chancellor Henry T. Yang is bringing in officers from UCLA, UC Irvine and UC Riverside every weekend to maintain safety on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had that every weekend … officers coming in Thursday through Sunday,” Prows said. “There’s been a huge commitment on it on the part of the chancellor to ensure the safety of the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Prows, the argument that there is too much police presence in I.V. has no basis, especially given the string of recent robberies this past week.</p>\n<p>“I think you could have a spirited debate between people saying it’s too much and people who are victims of either nonviolent or violent crimes that would say there’s not enough,” Prows said. “Especially this last week we’ve had three armed robberies, I’d have to argue that we don’t have enough officers.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said he approves of the university’s steps in taking “a bigger interest in the community” by providing alternative events to popular I.V. festivities such as concerts and fairs.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting together on different platforms to try to talk about issues and come up with resolutions,” Wilson said. “I think having different alternatives during these in advance, whether they’re planned or not, like the concerts, places for people to go — it’s the little things that make a big difference.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63205\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/guerry-awards-honor-efforts-of-community-police/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63205\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/guerry-awards-honor-efforts-of-community-police/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/guerry-awards-honor-efforts-of-community-police/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/guerry-awards-honor-efforts-of-community-police/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/guerry-awards-honor-efforts-of-community-police/","id":4700,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4699,4698,4697],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders’ Meeting Talks Taxes","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stakeholder_Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stakeholder_Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, students and county administrators gathered for the weekly stakeholders’ meeting Tuesday evening in the I.V.

Clinic building hosted by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office for continued discussions on Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3).</p>\n<p>During this week’s meeting, attendees discussed recent amendments to clarify how the Community Services District proposed by the bill will function if passed by the State Assembly. If AB 3 passes, a CSD would still require approval in a county-level vote.</p>\n<p>Community organizer from Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said if there is not adequate funding to support a financial feasibility study, it could delay the county-level approval process of AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Theoretically, say AB 3 is signed by the governor by October 11, then the County District Board of Supervisors would determine when to put it on the ballot,” Elliott said. “So, say we don’t have the financial feasibility study done by October 11, they will probably wait before they decide to put it on the ballot.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The district will not be able to operate until a Utility User’s Tax is passed to fund the district. – Community organizer from Das Williams’ office Darcel Elliott</p></blockquote>\n<p>Elliott said a vote to implement a Utility User’s Tax (UUT), a tax as a percentage of utility bills, would follow approval of the CSD.</p>\n<p>“The district will not be able to operate until a Utility User’s Tax is passed to fund the district,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>According to Elliott, the Assembly Committee on Local Government said William’s office should reintroduce AB 3 if the vote to establish a UUT does not pass.</p>\n<p>“If the tax passes with a two-thirds vote, the District becomes operational and will start providing services,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t pass, the committee recommended putting in a time frame to allow multiple attempts so they suggested ten years, because it’s a nice even number.”</p>\n<p>According to a presentation by Elliott, the CSD would be dissolved after ten years of inactivity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think if there was a way to mandate that the county interact with LAFCO during this process that puts it on the ballot maybe we can say that feasibility will be determined by so-and-so date by LAFCO. – Former A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>Former Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs and fourth-year political science and psychology double-major Cameron Schunk said a CSD is the best available way to establish self-governance for I.V.</p>\n<p>“I have concerns about the idea of pursuing a host of alternatives through other channels, when we have a channel right here that seems to be rather unified and, in my opinion, very effective for a lot of good reasons,” Schunk said. “I really have to disagree with the sentiment that this district may not accomplish what we set out to do if the county put it into place.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), an organization which regulates the formation of local government entities, could participate in the CSD approval process through involvement in financial feasibility research.</p>\n<p>“I think if there was a way to mandate that the county interact with LAFCO during this process that puts it on the ballot maybe we can say that feasibility will be determined by so-and-so date by LAFCO,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he supports having separate county-level votes approving a CSD and UUT.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t put the tax in it will only be 50 plus one to pass. With the tax it’s two-thirds,” Abboud said. “I would agree that it shouldn’t be the same just so that it speeds up the process and makes it less complicated it for people.”</p>\n<p>Stakeholders will continue discussion on AB 3 amendments at the I.V. clinic next Tuesday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63109\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63109\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/stakeholders-meeting-talks-taxes/","id":4701,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4700,4699,4698],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
