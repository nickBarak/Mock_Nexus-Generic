Army at home and a loss at Southeastern Louisiana earlier in the week.</p>\n<p>Both squads have no experience as of late in terms of having faced off, but the two teams almost met last year in the Tony Gwynn Classic. Had Tulane defeated UC San Diego, then it would have played Santa Barbara in the championship of the inaugural classic, which UCSB won.</p>\n<p>Another interesting tidbit is that the Green Waves actually defeated the Wildcats in that same tournament last season.</p>\n<p>That Arizona squad is the same one that went on to knock Santa Barbara off the College World Series, and went on to play for the College World Series championship before losing to eventual champion Coastal Carolina in three games.</p>\n<p>Experience was something the Gauchos expected they would be able to rely on heading into this season, as opposed to last year, but that has not been the case through four matches. In fact, UCSB looks like a completely different squad from a year ago after displaying many offensive struggles against Loyola Marymount and Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>Two players that were key components of the CWS squad, redshirt junior J.J. Muno and junior Austin Bush, have struggled mightily thus far. The redshirt junior and true junior have combined to bat 1-29 at the plate this year and striked out a total of 12 times in 29 at-bats.</p>\n<p>Last year, Muno had the best batting average on the team in players that had at least 140 at-bats after tallying 68 hits on 231 at-bats (.294), of which 18 were extra-base hits and five were home runs.</p>\n<p>This year, the second baseman has yet to register a hit in 14 at-bats. While he has managed to drive in two runs, the struggles are certainly concerning seeing how big a role Muno played a season ago.</p>\n<p>Bush’s struggles are on par with Muno’s as he is currently 1-15 on the season and has struck out a team-high seven times. The designated hitter is known to strike out a lot, as he proved last season with 60 strikeouts, the second-highest mark in the Big West; however, his game is predicated on his ability to hit the ball out of the park, something he did a lot with 11 homers, a league best as no other player registered double-digit home runs.</p>\n<p>Despite this, one veteran who has continued to excel into the new year is junior Clay Fisher.</p>\n<p>The shortstop currently ranks third on the team in batting average (.333) and is tied for first in both hits (5) and home runs (1). Fisher’s defensive presence is something that has garnered national attention since his acrobatic plays that made Sportscenter, which the Gauchos will also continue to rely on, as he has converted on three double-play opportunities.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">ICYMI… RT <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNU\">@ESPNU</a>: Is that Clay Fisher or Derek Jeter? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCSB_Baseball\">@UCSB_Baseball</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NCAACWS\">@NCAACWS</a></p>\n<p>Watch LIVE: <a href=\"https://t.co/0dEzqJ5k9I\">https://t.co/0dEzqJ5k9I</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oqCbK61Ug3\">pic.twitter.com/oqCbK61Ug3</a></p>\n<p>— Big West Baseball (@BigWestBaseball) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BigWestBaseball/status/738873869310758912\">June 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>UCSB will also hope to continue get great play from newcomers Colton Burns and Landon Silver. Burns, a junior college transfer, presently owns the best mark on the team in batting average (.385) and slugging percentage (.615). Freshman outfielder Silver has also been a welcomed addition, slashing .375/.444/.375 in three games played.</p>\n<p>Pitching on the mound Friday will be sophomore Noah Davis, who put forth a spectacular start last week, which saw him earn his and the team’s first win of the year. Against LMU, the right-hander went six innings allowing only four hits, one earned run and one walk alongside four strikeouts on 74 pitches.</p>\n<p>Sunday probable starter Joe Record will look to remedy a disappointing effort against Loyola, in which he only managed 3.2 innings allowing four runs, three of which were earned runs.</p>\n<p>Junior Kyle Nelson turned heads on Saturday as he started the game. Primarily known as a reliever, the left-hander went four innings in his first start of the year, allowing five hits and one earned run which, unfortunately, was enough to hand him the loss.</p>\n<p>The decision to start Nelson going forward will be interesting considering that, before the season, he was named the No. 6 reliever in the country by D1Baseball and was included on the NCBWA Stopper of the Year Watch List for the second time in his career.</p>\n<p>For Tulane, taking a series from a serious contender for making the NCAA regionals again would be a huge boost in turning around this season and looking more like the team from a year ago that made it as far as the Oxford Regional.</p>\n<p>Aiming to defend its AAC championship, the Green Waves will primarily rely on senior Hunter Williams, who currently holds the team’s best batting average after going 7-16 (.438) through the first four games. The infielder is also a threat with the long ball, as he already has two homers and is currently holding a slugging percentage .875.</p>\n<p>Senior Corey Merrill will also be a tough play on Friday. The right-handed pitcher had a solid first outing pitching seven innings and allowing only six hits, two earned runs en route to a victory.</p>\n<p>Despite the slow start, this certainly does not entail a bad season for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Four games is hardly a sample size worth noting when deciding to write a team off, especially when one factors that Santa Barbara’s most effective players have had early season struggles.</p>\n<p>Once those are corrected, who’s to say what could happen?</p>\n<p>To put things into perspective, current No. 15 Arizona started last year 2-3 before getting back on track and going on to have a spectacular season, finishing 38-20 on the year and making its college world series appearance. Point being, UCSB has plenty of time to get things in gear, but getting started sooner rather than later would be ideal.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins a three-game series with Tulane at 2 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 24, at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium with Saturday and Sunday’s games taking place at the same location and beginning at 2 p.m. and 1 p.m., respectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

It’s a truly amazing experience and I’m blessed to have had it.”</p>\n<p>Jordan’s campaign in 2016 for a position on the Board focused on increasing safety in Isla Vista through securing more street lighting and parking for residents. Now, she says the past two years in her role were more about working with other board members to create the foundation of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and define its role for the public.</p>\n<p>“That was a big part of it for me, was making sure that we were able to kind of set a precedent of what it meant to be on the Isla Vista Community Services District and setting a tone for the community as a resource.”</p>\n<p>Jordan participated in the CSD’s policy committee, which created governing documents for the functioning and mechanics of the Board as well as its interactions with the public and media.</p>\n<p>These policies helped to build the “baseline” for CSD’s growth and efficiency in the future, according to Jordan.</p>\n<p>While Jordan says the CSD has made progress toward increasing safety in Isla Vista, lighting and parking projects never came into full fruition during her term.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD organized lighting walks and began discussion on lighting in I.V., but there is still work to be done before the community will enjoy additional lighting in the area, according to Jordan.</p>\n<p>Increasing parking in I.V. also required a more lengthy and tedious process than anticipated, but as with lighting, Jordan hopes it will continue to be a priority for the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>“It’s still a pressing need for our community but should be set as a long term goal,” Jordan said. “I think there are a lot of solutions to kind of take that on.”</p>\n<p>Among the accomplishments made toward increasing safety in the community, Jordan cited the collaboration made with UC Police Department for safety stations in I.V. and the implementation of an interpersonal violence investigator as steps toward her overall term goals.</p>\n<p>Being the only woman on the board, Jordan said her perspective helped to shed light on safety concerns and issues faced by women in Isla Vista including sexual assault, catcalling and interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>“Of course I can’t speak for all women in any circumstance but I think the perspective I have as a woman in Isla Vista is really imperative… and being able to address those [concerns] from my perspective I think was really important and important for the board and our community to hear and understand,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Now that the board is without a female member, Jordan hopes that women in the community will pursue the opportunity to get involved with the board.</p>\n<p>“I do hope going forward that women in our community are inspired and empowered to come forward to take on these leadership positions.”</p>\n<p>Jordan also noted that her “frankness and honesty” during board meetings allowed her to contribute unique perspectives to discussions.</p>\n<p>“I’m never afraid to really speak my mind. I think that that’s a big part of what I brought to the board… a perspective that I had as a student, as a first-generation college student and a resident of Isla Vista,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Throughout her term, Jordan at times struggled to effectively divide roles and responsibilities among board directors, a challenge which she attributes to the initiative demonstrated by board directors.</p>\n<p>“I think all of us on the board are natural leaders and… everyone wants to take on as much as they can but I think being able to have us all kind of share in that responsibility is a really big part of it.”</p>\n<p>However, Jordan at times arrived late and left I.V. CSD Board meetings early or failed to show up at all, according to <i>Nexus </i>reporters who regularly attend the I.V. CSD meetings.</p>\n<p>Jordan said her absences were due to conflicts with her job as an event coordinator. When her work conflicted with I.V. CSD meetings, Jordan was obligated to attend her paying job over the meetings, which Board directors only began getting paid for last November.</p>\n<p>“I was responsible for paying for my own tuition, which is a big issue so as a full-time student I was also working around 55 hours a week,” Jordan said. “At the end of the day, I needed to make sure that I could pay for my school, which is the reason that I was here in Isla Vista in the first place.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I do hope going forward that women in our community are inspired and empowered to come forward to take on these leadership positions.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>During her term, Jordan oriented herself more toward university players and issues, but said that I.V. CSD could have benefitted from her developing more relationships with stakeholders in I.V. as well.</p>\n<p>“I was much more involved with university politics than I was more local and state, so I think that learning more about those key players and how I could’ve contributed to those conversations would have been meaningful to the board,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Jordan said she fulfilled her role on the board to the best of her ability despite these difficulties. Overall, she said she is proud of the work she did while serving on the Board.</p>\n<p>Going forward, Jordan advises that the I.V. CSD maintains their obligation to the community as their top priority.</p>\n<p>“I think the only thing that we should be concerned about is continuing to serve the community and just always keeping that as our guiding force,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jordan believes the past two years have set up the board for success in the future.</p>\n<p>“I have very high hopes that this inaugural board was precedent setting for expectations for board members for years to come and also in creating relationships with community members and truly being a representative government.”</p>\n<p>For the next I.V. CSD Vice President, Jordan said that being open to the opinions and suggestions of others is vital to the position.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is coming into it with their own unique perspectives and everyone is coming into it with what they feel is the right thing to do,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Hearing people out is the most important thing you can do [when] trying to make an educated decision.”</p>\n<p>Jordan also said that I.V. CSD needs a vice president with a strong resolve and commitment to the community.</p>\n<p>“Somebody who [has] got a can-do attitude and has a little bit of grit. That’s what we need in Isla Vista. Somebody with grit and a willingness to get it done at all costs,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>After completing her master’s degree this June, Jordan hopes to obtain a job that provides her with the same motivation she found while serving on the I.V. CSD Board.</p>\n<p>“Being able to find a career that still gives me that meaning and driving force and willingness to go to work everyday is really important,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>“I hope that eventually I’m able to come back to something like a local elected position because I really found a lot of purpose and meaning in that job as well.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction [1:07 p.m.]: An earlier version of this article said there were three empty seats on the board.

However, the rest of the weekend was a bit of a struggle for the shortstop, as he only went 2-7 in the final two games. He currently still leads the team in batting average (.364), RBI (3), on-base percentage (.462) and slugging percentage (.727).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will also need better outings from veterans J.J. Muno and Austin Bush. Muno, a redshirt junior, went 0-10 on the weekend but did manage two RBIs. Bush, a junior, only mustered one hit in his 11 at-bats and drove in a run, but he struck out five times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Colton Burns was a pleasant surprise on the weekend, and hopefully, he can sustain his confident play. The utility player homered in the opening game against LMU and batted a solid .273 over the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most likely starting today for the Gauchos on the mound will be junior Chris Clements. If he plays, it would be the right-hander’s first action of the season. As a sophomore, he made seven appearances and two starts only mustering a 10.13 ERA over 13.1 innings pitched with 13 strikeouts and eight walks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The junior will need to be on his A-game today as there are some solid hitters in the Bakersfield lineup. Senior Ryan Grotjohn batted .636 over the weekend after going 7-11 against Utah and also drove in one run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow senior Max Carter and junior Andrew Penner also had a solid opening weekend series as both earned five hits a piece and batted .455 and .417, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite not having named a starter, CSUB will be a tough outing for the Gauchos as they have solid arms in the pen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season, the two teams split their two-game series with the road team being the victor in each outing. The Gauchos scored 10 runs in a win but only four runs in the loss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is only one game, this game certainly feels like a must-win for this Gaucho team. It is not a make or break moment, but it would be great to see this team overcome some early season adversity after the high expectations placed on them this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB faces off against CSUB at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 21, at Hardt Field.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Catcher/infielder Jake Ortega then turned loose on a 1-0 pitch count and doubled down the left field line scoring a run and extending the lead to 2-0. The sophomore finished the night 1-3 with the lone RBI. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although allowing two runs in the second, Clements was nearly unhittable the rest of the way allowing only two hits. However, the junior picked up his first loss of the season after 5.1 innings pitched, allowing six hits, two earned runs, two walks and only registering one strikeout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moten, a sophomore who had been solid all day, began to struggle as the eighth progressed. After freshman outfielder Landon Silver took a walk, junior shortstop Clay Fisher singled to left putting runners on first and second with no outs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a sac bunt advancing the runners a base, Moten was relieved by Dewsnap ending a solid afternoon’s work. The right-hander finished the evening after 7.1 innings allowing only three hits and one earned run while registering nine strikeouts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to the plate was junior utility Colton Burns who continued his hot start to the season with a single right up the middle scoring Silver and putting Fisher, the tying run, at third with only one out. Burns finished the day 2-2 with a RBI.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this very advantageous position, the Gauchos failed to capitalize as junior designated hitter Austin Bush could not muster a hit or even a sac fly as he struck out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two outs, J.J. Muno still had a chance to tie the game, but the redshirt junior continues to struggle as he flew out to left field and was unable to score the tying run. The second baseman finished the night 0-4 and is still hitless on the season through four games as he is 0-14. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting out of the tough jam, Dewsnap was able to finish off the Gauchos in the ninth securing the victory for Moten and earning his first save of the season. The junior finished allowing only one hit and striking out two batters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the season first began last week, especially after an opening day victory, no one could’ve expected the offensive struggles that are currently plaguing UCSB. However, with the season still in its early stages, there is no need to press a panic button yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, now that the Gauchos are coming home, maybe the offensive struggles can be corrected behind the roar of a great Gaucho crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara faces off against Tulane at Caesar Uyeska Stadium beginning Friday, Feb. 24, at 2 p.m. for a three-game series this weekend.  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
