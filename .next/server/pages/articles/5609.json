Decisions were made instantaneously and UCSB found themselves on top almost the entire way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos had to take the lead in sets one and three after quick starts for Fullerton, but never gave them back. The middle set was a Gauchos game from start to finish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlights for Fullerton include junior right side Tyler Fezzey who shot .412 for 8 kills, junior setter Makenzi Abelman and her 23 assists and junior libero Savahna Costello, who was the only player in the game to reach 10 digs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ennis has been quietly consistent all season and Saturday’s match against UCI was more of the same. Her .462 hitting percentage produced 7 kills while she also added 2 assists, 2 service aces, 5 digs and 4 total blocks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruddins led both teams in kills with 15, but Anteater freshmen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">middle blocker Onye Ofoegbu and outside hitter Joy Umeh</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kept the pressure on with 12 and 10 kills, respectively. They shot a combined .508 and forced the Gauchos to be composed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And composed they were, committing 3 less errors en route to a 3-0 sweep that included 23 ties and 5 lead changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The late wins just weren’t enough as the Gauchos finished one game back of Cal Poly and two of Big West champions Hawai’i. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Losses to Hawai’i in each game and a loss at Cal Poly proved to be the most significant matches of the entire season. Victories in each of these games would have brought UCSB the real victory, the Big West Championship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much of the talk this season focused on how different this Gauchos team was than in recent years, that this team had become composed clinicians ready to fight with strong leads or uphill battles. Unfortunately for head coach Nicole Lantagne Welch and her squad, the very first test had no margin for error.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming home for a match against the Rainbow Wahine after having won their 13th straight game, Hawai’i made quick work of the Gauchos in a 3-0 sweep and holding Ruddins to just 12 kills off a .216 hitting percentage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That just cannot happen to a team vying to stake their claim amongst the elite. They did, however, follow-up that heartbreaker with a 3-1 Blue-Green win against the Mustangs team that simply took the Gauchos too lightly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruddins missed that game with an injury she sustained in training while Lovenberg and freshman setter Romoni Vivao dished out 40 assists to seal the deal on an absolutely masterful team win. Freshman right side Tallulah Froley filled in quite nicely, posting 16 kills off a .250 hitting percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, as fair or unfair as one might argue, a few failed tests heavily outweighed the passed ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This team had plenty of bright spots to appreciate, but onwards is where the ship goes and Welch will need to prepare to set course without the help of the graduating seniors</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">star Ruddins, outside hitters Torre Glasker and Chloe Allen and middle blocker-right side Charlie Robinson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They will be greatly missed, but the Welch Way is to carry on, and the aforementioned would love nothing more than for her to lead this team to the promised land. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

It was senior outside hitter Jessica McRoskey’s performance that shined the brightest, however, as she cruised to 11 kills thanks to a phenomenal .714 kill percentage while also committing just a single error.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs did more than just finish though as they ended the night with significant advantages over the Gauchos in service aces (6-0), blocks (3-1) and digs (34-28). It wasn’t just Dvoracek and McRoskey that provided the firepower either, as five Mustangs finished the night with at least six kills, as opposed to the Gauchos’ two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all honesty, there wasn’t a whole lot of bright spots for UCSB as Cal Poly was seemingly a step ahead of them in every facet of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One could argue that Olivia Lovenberg and Romoni Vivao, who posted 13 and 10 assists respectively, showed up and played their parts, but the fact of the matter is that the performance put on at the Mott Athletics Center is just unacceptable for a team vying for championship glory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was two weeks ago when I argued UC Riverside would pose the bigger threat to UCSB as they were preparing for a two-game road trip against both UC Davis and Riverside, because there’s something different about playing the spectrum ends when you’re smack-dab in the middle of attempting to claim the elusive title of elite. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see, the Gauchos were 17-2 coming off of two games in which they saw their 13-game win streak shut down at the hands of Hawai’i, only to then vigorously stampede the Mustangs to a 3-1 victory that surely made every Gaucho fan think, “This is the year.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because when you’re an elite team, you don’t go home sulking over a lost win streak. You go home and learn. You learn from the performance, and you get right back to training.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The schedule now reads UC Davis and UC Riverside with just a day in between. Davis was 3-5 in their previous eight games, including a loss to UCSB, and was looking to continue their push for respect, considering there was and is a significant gap between them and the Cerberus that is Hawai’i, Cal Poly and UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, while Davis must have been looking to taste that sweet revenge, there’s nothing more revealing of a top team than a loss to the bottom feeders. Being elite means there can’t be losses to last-place teams, and that there must be wins not against other top teams, but in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">big</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back-to-back sweeps that weekend didn’t reveal much, but the Gauchos did what they were supposed to do. A 3-1 win over Long Beach State meant the Gauchos were rolling again at the right time with Hawai’i and Cal Poly next on the calendar yet again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two big games. In fact, considering the hit UCSB’s championship hopes would take in the event of just a single loss, these were two very big games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And they were two very bad losses. A solid performance at Hawai’i was capped by an absolute collapse of a final set that allowed the Rainbow Wahine to move into first place, while Mustang Madness was clearly scheduled at the Mott. The Gauchos now find themselves at third place with just four games left. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will need to win out if they are to keep their hopes of glory alive. Time will tell who these Gauchos really are, but for now, we will have to steer clear of that elusive elite. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will hit the road for back-to-back matches against both Long Beach State and CSUN this weekend. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91119\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/the-elusive-elite-gauchos-fail-to-stake-claim-in-biggest-game-of-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91119\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/the-elusive-elite-gauchos-fail-to-stake-claim-in-biggest-game-of-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/the-elusive-elite-gauchos-fail-to-stake-claim-in-biggest-game-of-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/the-elusive-elite-gauchos-fail-to-stake-claim-in-biggest-game-of-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/the-elusive-elite-gauchos-fail-to-stake-claim-in-biggest-game-of-season/","id":5606,"author":{"id":280,"name":"Nick DiPierro"},"related":[5605,5604,5603],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hoping For Strong Finish to the Season, CSUN Looking to Play Spoiler","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2019-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NEW-WomenVolleyballUCI-11.10.17-SichengWang-1-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NEW-WomenVolleyballUCI-11.10.17-SichengWang-1-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will visit the infamous Walter Pyramid this Friday, where they will take on Long Beach State, before heading to Northridge on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_79750\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-WomenVolleyballUCI-11.10.17-SichengWang-1-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"278264912\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"91281\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79750\" data-attachment-id=\"79750\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/ucsb-takes-goal-oriented-approach-into-road-trip/charlie-robinson-swings-at-a-quick-set-sicheng-wangdaily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-WomenVolleyballUCI-11.10.17-SichengWang-1-print.jpg?fit=2048%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Charlie Robinson swings at a quick set.

Long Beach’s Kennedy takes the spot for the most inefficient of the combined eight at .155.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking into account the fact that Long Beach is playing for respect and the Gauchos are still seeking silverware, it’ll be a hard-fought match with the Gauchos likely taking the win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Players to look out for include all of the aforementioned as each offense is set to have a stout cast of warriors around them capable of fighting from start to finish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN will pose the bigger threat this weekend given their extraordinary form as of late. It should also be mentioned that CSUN’s last three games are against Cal Poly, UCSB and Hawai’i, in that order. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What a tough fight to end the season for all remaining teams, but it’s a given at this point that the Matadors would love nothing more than to add a little drama to this soap opera that is the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN is led by Seyvion Waggoner who leads her team with 311 kills, but at just a .235 rate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other notable stat advantages include errors, in which UCSB leads at 429-474, and service aces, in which CSUN leads at 129-104. This means the Matadors are flinging fire at 5.16 free points per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is obvious that the Matadors have been nothing short of devastating on the serve. The Gauchos will have to be focused if they are to defend CSUN’s masterful service game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as the Gauchos are concerned, Olivia Lovenberg will likely be Olivia Lovenberg, Deni Wilson will surely be looking to finish her freshman year strong and Ruddins will have to be ready to roll if UCSB is to have any hope at hopping Hawai’i or Cal Poly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other players to watch include UCSB’s Froley and Romoni Vivao and CSUN’s Waggoner, Kamalu Makekau-Whittaker (455 assists) and Makayla Bradford (355 digs). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will visit the infamous Walter Pyramid this Friday, where they will take on Long Beach State, before heading to Northridge on Saturday. Both games will kick off at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

So do you, right? You might have walked past quite a few dogs on your way to class, even stopped for a moment to pet one of them. Maybe you have a puppy at home or your house is filled with cats or you have a rabbit that you just absolutely adore. Me? I have two dogs, a chinchilla and three birds back at home, and I can say with certainty that I love them all. Every six in ten Americans has a pet. Why do so many people turn to animals for companionship? Well, we aren’t as different from animals as we think.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all seek happiness. We all do our best to avoid pain. Have you ever accidentally stepped on your dog’s paw and then felt like the most loathsome human imaginable? Why did you then continue to apologize profusely to your dog, even though you knew Buddy didn’t understand a single word you just said? </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We do this because we know that even though our pets can’t express their emotions in the same way as humans, they still </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Dogs, like humans — like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> animals — experience love and happiness, loneliness and fear, pain and suffering. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, every year, over 70 billion animals are raised and slaughtered in ways that would bring any human being with an ounce of compassion in their soul to tears.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we believe it is okay — even ethical — to eat certain animals but not others?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On factory farms, cows, pigs and chickens are crammed into filthy feedlots and injected with hormones, stimulants and antibiotics. Many of these animals are fed “renders,” which can range anywhere from dead and ground up cows to diseased animals, roadkill and euthanized pets instead of proper meals.  They live out their short lives bloodied, battered, breathing in toxic fumes, covered in sores and unable to move an inch, until they finally wind up as the ground beef for your Tuesday night tacos or the chicken nuggets you just ate for lunch. When I was younger, my family and I had the urge to save a hummingbird from dying outside in the cold, while also continuing to eat chicken for dinner. Why do we believe it is okay — even ethical — to eat certain animals but not others? We are conditioned at a young age to believe that cows, pigs, chickens, sheep and fish are somehow lesser than the dogs, cats, bunnies and horses that we love so dearly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ignorance, apathy and hypocrisy of humans all sustain this unsustainable lifestyle of factory farming. In addition to the ethical immorality, consuming animals also has drastic ramifications for our planet. While 13 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions is due to transportation, including road, rail, air and marine, a whopping 51 percent is due to breeding livestock and their byproducts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, carpooling instead of driving solo, biking to and from work and even cutting down driving won’t be enough to save us, although doing all of these are still beneficial. In the United States, 55 percent of our water use goes toward animal agriculture, whereas five percent of water use is domestic or used for drinking, showering, washing dishes, etc. Consequently, shortening our showers and fixing leaky plumbing only saves a drop or two in the bucket. As if the effects of this industry weren’t already concerning enough, every minute, the animals bred for food produce seven million pounds of excrement. Lovely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with these facts, you still might remain apathetic to the detrimental effects animal agriculture has on the environment — it’s not like we only have one life-sustaining planet or anything. Climate change, water use, deforestation, species extinction, fisheries, land use and waste — all of these are severely affected by animal agriculture, whether we want to acknowledge our harsh reality or not. Every second, animals die and the earth pays for our ignorance, delusion and indifference. With billions of us consuming meat daily, the implications are frightening. Every day, we hear snippets of the environmental disaster surrounding us: Species of animals and plants are rapidly becoming extinct.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start cutting down the amount of meat in your diet. Then, if you’re feeling brave, cut it all out. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of ocean dead zones is increasing. Every day, we have the choice to turn a blind eye or to do something. The excuse, “I’m just one person. What difference can I make?” just won’t cut it anymore. When the production of one hamburger patty requires 660 gallons of water — the equivalent of showering for two months — the impact each individual person has is huge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, there is hope. An entirely plant-based diet reduces your carbon footprint by 50 percent, but even consciously making the effort to reduce our meat intake makes a substantial difference. Although the ultimate, sustainable goal would be for everyone to become vegan, I’m taking baby steps. By removing animals from my menu, I’ve already come a long way from being the girl who posted a picture of her In-N-Out cheeseburger on Instagram a few years ago with the profound caption, “Wow” and the heart-eye emoji. After nearly a year and a half of being vegetarian, I can definitely say the change was worth it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start cutting down the amount of meat in your diet. Then, if you’re feeling brave, cut it all out. Start reducing the amount of animal products in your diet. Then, make the choice to remove them entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having compassion for animals is better for the animals. It’s better for your body. It’s better for your soul. It’s better for the environment. Having compassion for animals is better for the world.</span></p>\n<p><em>Calista Liu wants everyone to consider the ethical consequences of meat-eating.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Plant-Based Privilege: Why Veganism Needs a New Approach</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years ago, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PETA.org</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published an article entitled “Top 10 Reasons to Go Vegan in the New Year.” Nestled between valid reasons like “save the planet” and “help feed the world” was this: “All the cool kids are doing it,” followed by a list of high-profile celebrities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name-dropping those who “regularly appear in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magazine” is usually a failsafe marketing strategy. When it comes to veganism, however, this method is counterproductive. It makes veganism seem pretentious, undermining its personal benefits and positive impact. Worse, it contributes to the misconception that this lifestyle is only for the wealthy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, veganism is a privilege that not everyone can afford. Being able to subsist comfortably on an animal-free diet is only possible with sufficient time and money. Poor people are never included in conversations about going meatless and eating green. Those who say “anyone can go vegan” are turning a blind eye to classism, poverty and how the meat industry profits off of both.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a reason why going full herbivore is called “converting.” Most people find the transition difficult because their favorite foods contain butter, eggs or milk. Ingredients like soy, rice, almond and coconut are popular substitutes for the real thing. They make the switch not just tolerable, but enjoyable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re also significantly more expensive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writer Antonia Noori Farzan published an article about the cost of these alternative products. Over the course of a month, she compared the prices of her purchases to their non-vegan counterparts. In total, eating vegan costs her roughly $100 a month. If you’re a member of the middle class, that’s pricey. If you’re one of the 40 million Americans making minimum wage, that’s unthinkable.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those living at or below the poverty line don’t possess the money, time or cooking equipment to accommodate a vegan diet.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veganism, however, is about more than paying for food — it’s also about having the time to prepare it. Vegan or not, home-cooked meals are both labor- and time-consuming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with meat and dairy substitutes (whose absence would “take the joy out of eating”), cooking made it easier for fellow Gaucho Lily Garcia-Daly to convert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was really lucky to have a family that supported my lifestyle change. Not everyone has a mom who would buy them almond milk in addition to normal milk for the rest of the fam[sic]. Not only did she encourage me to make my own meals, but she also made plant-based meals for my non-vegan family,” Garcia-Daly said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those living at or below the poverty line don’t possess the money, time or cooking equipment to accommodate a vegan diet. Some parents work multiple jobs or round-the-clock shifts to support their families. This leaves little time for stewing lentils or grilling tofu burgers. Even if cost wasn’t an issue, there’s no vegan equivalent of McDonald’s or KFC. Vegan options at fast food establishments are nonexistent, unless you count french fries. Even so, fast food is unhealthy and unsustainably grown, fundamentally clashing with vegan values.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, fast food is the only option for those living in extreme poverty. While they aren’t America’s largest consumers of fast food, poor people are preyed upon by the industry more than other members of society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the result of “food deserts,” which the fast food industry helped to create. Food deserts are low-income neighborhoods in which healthy and affordable food is scarce. In these same neighborhoods, Wendy’s and Taco Bells flourish on every corner. The multi-billion-dollar meat, agriculture and fast food industries collude to make their products cheap and easily accessible. As a result, obesity is rising in low-income areas and has surpassed smoking as a leading cause of death. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to go vegan isn’t as simple as plants versus meat or right versus wrong.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These industries work together to trap the marginalized in a vicious cycle of poverty. The fast food industry is one of the most unequal industries in the U.S. While their CEOs are among the highest paid, their employees are by far the lowest paid. The meat and agriculture industries pocket an enormous profit from overworking and underpaying their employees. Many of these laborers are undocumented immigrants with no other employment opportunities. Fast food corporations profit as well, exploiting their workers and selling their labor back to them in the form of hamburgers and chicken nuggets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these industries have the lower class right where they want it: on both sides of the counter. There is no place for veganism in the struggle to survive on minimum wage. It’s not even a topic of conversation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, claiming that veganism is universally accessible is ignorant. Preaching that veganism is morally superior is similarly inconsiderate. The implication that anyone who doesn’t convert doesn’t care about the earth vilifies the underprivileged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More importantly, it distracts people from the task at hand: finding solutions. The decision to go vegan isn’t as simple as plants versus meat or right versus wrong. Budget, schedule and family size also need to be taken into consideration. Veganism’s mission goes beyond winning over individuals — it involves tackling the intertwined injustices of the immigration system, poverty and the meat industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than imposing judgment, advocates of veganism should focus on education and activism. There are also smaller-scale fixes. Vegans can encourage people to cut down on food waste and meat consumption, buy locally if they can afford it and teach people how to do their best with limited resources. The food industries may be rich and powerful, but there are still opportunities to affect change through individual action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reality, a plant-based diet is doable for most Americans. Protein sources like meat and dairy can be swapped out for beans, nuts and grains without additional cost. But to realize the vision of a sustainable food economy, veganism must be presented as more accessible and less elite. Otherwise, meat-eaters who can afford to convert will feel discouraged from doing so. Those who cannot will be left out of the conversation entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time you hear someone say, “Everyone could go vegan if they wanted to,” challenge them to consider who they mean by “everyone” and who they’re leaving out.</span></p>\n<p><em>Harper Lambert brings up the issues of making veganism a trend.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7283.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Harper Lambert</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Harper Lambert is the editor-in-chief for the 2020-2021 school year.
