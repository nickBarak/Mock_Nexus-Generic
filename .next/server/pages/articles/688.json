In that game, the Mustangs shot 48.7 percent from the field and tallied 22 assists. Junior center Molly Schelmer scored a career-high 28 points while senior guard Kayla Griffin nearly tallied a triple-double with eight points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>“It was the first game we watched the next day,” Mitchell said. “They just strike so quickly. They were up 20 points on Pacific in the first half and that’s going to be hard for a team like ourselves and our style of play to recover from that. We have to come out ready to play from the tip because if we bury ourselves into that deep of a hole, it will be a long night.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game with momentum as well, after a dominating 58-43 performance over UC Davis Saturday. Defensively, the Gauchos held the Aggies to 11 first-half points, the fourth lowest point total by an opponent in a half in the program’s history, while assisting 17 of their 20 field goals on the offensive end. Junior guard Melissa Zornig paced Santa Barbara offensively with a career-high 24 points.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also enter with an extra chip on their shoulder as Cal Poly won both matchups last year.</p>\n<p>However, Cal Poly is a very different team from last year, having lost to graduation Kristina Santiago, who compiled the most points in program history and led the Big West last year with 23.1 points and 10.1 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“On any given night, it’s a different person leading them in scoring,” Mitchell said. “They have a lot of experience and they’re just not going to and through one person this year.”</p>\n<p>As a team, the Mustangs want to score a lot and they want to score quickly. Often playing with a three guard lineup, they rank second in the Big West in both scoring offense and three point field goal percentage at 69.5 points per game and 33.8 percent, respectively. In addition, Cal Poly leads the conference in assists with 16.5 per game.</p>\n<p>“We know they want to get out and push the ball,” Mitchell said. “We can’t match them in points, so if we can slow them down and hopefully make them execute more in the half court, then we’ll have a shot to win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB would like to keep the score much lower and allow its defense to control the game as the Gauchos rank first in scoring defense, allowing teams just 55.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>“[Defense is] always our main focus,” Zornig said.“Defense is going to win games,so if we play our defense, then the offense will flow.”</p>\n<p>As a result, the tempo will likely decide which team comes out victorious.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to slow down the ball, whether it’s being taken out or rebounded,”senior forward Kirsten Tilleman said. “We usually send a lot of rebounders to the (offensive) glass, but we’re going to have to be a lot more aware of the leaking out.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, rebounding will be a very important key for UCSB. The Mustangs lead the Big West in rebounding at 42.5 per game, which allows them to jumpstart their fast break.</p>\n<p>Helping Santa Barbara on the boards will be two of the top rebounders in conference: Tilleman and senior forward Sweets Underwood. With Underwood ranking third in the Big West with 8.6 boards per game and Tilleman pulling down 6.5 rebounds per game, the Gauchos have become the best in the Big West in rebounding defense, holding their opponents to 33.4 boards per contest.</p>\n<p>However, with Cal Poly typically playing a smaller lineup, the Gauchos will need the guards to hit the glass as well.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 4 p.m. at Robert A. Mott Gymnasium.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January 18th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49492\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/ucsb-travels-cal-poly-heated-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49492\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/ucsb-travels-cal-poly-heated-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/ucsb-travels-cal-poly-heated-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/ucsb-travels-cal-poly-heated-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/ucsb-travels-cal-poly-heated-rivalry/","id":688,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[687,686,685],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Pacific Tigers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With this year being the University of the Pacific women’s basketball team’s final year in the Big West conference, the Tigers are looking for a way to make it special.

Currently, the Tigers have three players averaging double-digit scoring.</p>\n<p>“I think if you’re relying on one or two players and they have an off night, then you’re screwed,” Roberts said. “Thankfully, we’re lucky enough to have players where if one’s having an off night, we still can score.”</p>\n<p>Leading Pacific is senior forward Kendall Rodriguez, who was voted to finish on the all-conference team in the preseason media polls. She averages 12.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Kendall Kenyon averages a double-double with 11.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, the only player in the Big West to do so.

Not only does she average 9.5 points per game, but she ranks first in assists to turnover ratio at 1.8.

UCSB took a quick 9-2 lead after a 7-0 run.</p>\n<p>“I think after the bad loss against Pacific we knew we had to come with some energy,” senior guard Angelei Aguirre said. “We had to come out with intensity if we were going to win this game because Davis is a very good team.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos held the Aggies to 11 points on 13 percent shooting in the first half. Davis’ halftime total will go down in UCSB record books as the fourth-fewest points scored by an opponent in a half.</p>\n<p>“It’s communication and discipline,” Mitchell said. “We understand that they run a system where there are a lot of backdoor hits and we took switches one through five.”</p>\n<p>As basketball is known for being a game of runs, Davis tried to narrow the gap to open the second half, using an 8-0 run to cut UCSB’s lead down to 10. However, the Gauchos responded with a 12-3 run of their own.</p>\n<p>The Aggies didn’t quit, though, using a 9-0 run to make the difference just 10 again with 5:24 to go, but Santa Barbara once again found an answer, sinking eight of its 10 free throw shots in the final two minutes.</p>\n<p>“I think we got together and knew we weren’t going to lose the game,” Aguirre said. “We buckled down, held each other accountable and got stops when we needed them.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, UCSB moved the ball quickly, passing through Davis’ infamous trapping defense. The Gauchos dished out 17 assists on its 20 field goal attempts and shot 45.5 percent from the field. Zornig and junior guard Nicole Nesbit tied for a team-high five assists.</p>\n<p>The 20 field goals marks the second-most for UCSB this season.</p>\n<p>“On the offensive side, I was extremely pleased with how we played,” Mitchell said. “The overall effort was there. I think by scoring 58 (points), we’re showing on the offensive end what we can do, whereas you might not have seen that until the last five games last year.”</p>\n<p>Zornig was the star for Santa Barbara offensively, but UCSB had many players contiribute in the victory. Aguirre scored nine points and grabbed eight rebounds and senior center Kirsten Tilleman tallied nine boards and a team-high two steals.</p>\n<p>“What [Tilleman] does for our team and the value she presents on both ends of the court, it’s never going to show up on the stat sheet — toughness, the ability to get key rebounds, and taking charges every game,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>While the Aggies lead the Big West in triples made per game with 7.1, Davis struggled from behind the arc, shooting 4-23.</p>\n<p>“A three for them is the same as a lay-up for most teams, so the game plan was to switch one through five,” Mitchell said. “Someone like Tilleman, Lei or Sweets was able to guard their point guard at times and did a great job, so it was about making them put it on the floor and we had great rotation on the weak side.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be next Saturday when the team takes on Cal Poly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 14th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49351\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-snaps-twogame-losing-streak-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49351\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-snaps-twogame-losing-streak-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-snaps-twogame-losing-streak-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-snaps-twogame-losing-streak-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-snaps-twogame-losing-streak-uc-davis/","id":686,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[685,684,683],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Downs Cal Poly in 2OT Thriller","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Taran-Brown1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Taran-Brown1.jpg?resize=500%2C320&ssl=1","description":"Rarely do rivalry games live up to their billing, let alone surpass them.

\r\n</script> \n<p>“You put this type of effort out and you get a win, it’s a positive thing for your group and hopefully it spring-boards us a little bit in terms of our toughness and how hard we play,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “I honestly think we grew up a little bit tonight.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is now 7-10 overall and 3-3 in the Big West as Cal Poly falls to 7-9 overall and 3-3 in conference.</p>\n<p>Shooting only 39 percent from the field in the first half, Santa Barbara went into halftime down 32-27, but an apparent hamstring injury to Williams — the team’s leading scorer and rebounder — late in the first half put the outcome of the game in question for UCSB.</p>\n<p>With no inside presence left, Coach Williams opted for a smaller lineup and implemented shooters at each position to offset the hole left by Alan Williams. The move worked out for the Gauchos as they still out-rebounded the Mustangs 44-41, and freshman guard Michael Bryson limited Cal Poly’s top scorer, junior forward Chris Eversley, to 24 percent shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>“We’re in this game tonight because of three freshmen: Michael Bryson [who was] defensively phenomenal on Eversley and then Sam [Beeler] and Mitch [Brewe] and their filling of Al’s shoes,” Williams said. “We had to have those three freshmen take about 40 minutes. If you would’ve told me we beat Cal Poly without Al, I would’ve said that’s highly unlikely.”</p>\n<p>After allowing Cal Poly a three-point basket with a minute left, freshman forward Taran Brown knocked down a three of his own to tie the game at 66 and send the game into overtime. With the game still tied in the first overtime, Santa Barbara’s stingy defense forced a turnover in the final possession to extend the game into another overtime period.</p>\n<p>Allowing only five points in the first overtime, the Gauchos found themselves down by one point with 21 seconds left in the second overtime, which set the stage for junior guard Kyle Boswell. With an open lane available, Boswell took the ball to the hole for the game-winning layup, taking a hard foul in the process.</p>\n<p>“They didn’t obviously want me to get the three up and that kind of left an open lane,” Boswell said. “I kind of threw it up and I knew I got fouled. I didn’t think there was a chance of it going in but sometimes it’ll surprise you.”</p>\n<p>Boswell played 41 minutes off the bench and led all Gauchos in scoring with a career-high 23 on the night.</p>\n<p>“He’s just a big-time player.
