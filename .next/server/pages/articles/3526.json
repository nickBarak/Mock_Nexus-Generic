Don’t sit-back — reform is a participation sport, and you’re up to bat.</p>\n<p>We have entered an age where a student who wants an affordable education is considered an extremist.  Next generation’s UC students will pay more than their predecessors for less of an education than the system has ever offered. While the Regents of the University of California and their police cohorts might say that UC students are rebellious gits with no respect for bureaucratic procedure, they have criminalized our inherent right to learn and better ourselves through schooling.</p>\n<p>Our campaign for education was never a radical request. In their fight for the right to education, California’s youth has never asked for more than they were entitled. </p>\n<p>However, to our dismay, the practice of denial and scapegoating has become a staple of behavior from UC leadership.</p>\n<p>We find it absolutely imperative to remind the Regents that the UC is a public institution, and that its mission is to provide an affordable quality education to those who qualify. The Regents have thus far failed in their pledge to adhere to the California Master Plan and support California students as well as uphold their right to an affordable, equal higher education decades ago.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, students braved brandished weapons and pepper spray in a commendable but likely futile effort to return balanced decision-making to the UC.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in modern times, our students are persecuted, pepper-sprayed and taunted with handguns whenever they voice their discontent.</p>\n<p>At yesterday’s meeting, a police officer pulled a pistol on student protesters. While circumstances are still unclear, the fact of the matter is that a UC police officer pointed a deadly weapon at unarmed students whose only request was to be offered an affordable education.</p>\n<p>Although police presence was requested in the case the protest went awry, yesterday’s violence between law enforcement and students is indicative of a larger desperation that has now enveloped the entire UC system.</p>\n<p>Not only did last year’s 32 percent fee increases break the bank, but Mark Yudof now proposes to add an additional eight percent to that number and raise the total cost of a public education in California to an unprecedented 40 percent over the last two years.</p>\n<p>How far can our pockets stretch? How long can UC executives reach into them to pay for the state’s fiscal mismanagement?</p>\n<p>We understand that money is scarce and times are hard — not just for the UC, but for the nation as a whole. However, this does not excuse a lack of UC investment into the classroom. We are the next generation, and we demand the same access to public education that was given to the generations before us.</p>\n<p>The Board of Regents has consistently passed responsibility for this injustice onto the state, declaring their hands and tongues tied in addressing the matter. But denial can only go so far.</p>\n<p>We have some words for the UC executives who have failed to take the students’ interests into account: take responsibility for your failure to represent us in this economic crisis. Take responsibility for the overwhelmed parents and students, the poorly paid professors, the underfunded programs, the lack of campus resources and the packed classrooms. Recognize that you are indeed the upper echelon of a decision-making process that trickles down into real world consequences for all the students you pledged to serve when you took your position. Realize your potential to change the situation for the better and to ease the sting of the recession for California citizens who deserve an education.</p>\n<p>Students: realize your responsibility to ensure that this change happens. Keep your elected representatives honest, both for your sake and the sake of subsequent generations. Silence is consent in this case, and unless you are enthusiastic about forking over more of your money to the UC Regents, we suggest you speak up.</p>\n<p>Yesterday’s protest was a wake-up call. It serves to remind us of the risks our peers are willing to take to ensure our right to an accessible education is still existent. The risks, consequences and future of a declining and unaffordable UC system are real.</p>\n<p>We are delusional to appreciate the efforts of our UC leadership. Students have every reason to believe that we have been forsaken. The UC was once recognized as an accessible path to higher education; it was once considered an affordable option for a world-class education. Now, elitist values and exclusionary prices ensure that this education is only extended to the rich.</p>\n<p>The UC Board of Regents has failed you. It’s time to take matters into our own hands.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30176\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30176\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/","id":3526,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3525,3524,3523],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[1843,3129,3259,3502,3503,3504,3507,3508,3509,3518,3526,3536,3579,3646,4290,7849],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A Love Affair With Ink","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There’s no doubt that tattoos have meaning.

He interviewed hundreds for his 2008 book “Permanence: Tattoo Portraits” in search of what inspires people to embody their stories in ink.</p>\n<p>“My work has always been about identity,” Fulbeck said. “I’m not interested in the actual tattoo. I’m more interested in why they do what they do.”<br>\nIn all of his travels, Fulbeck said the only constant has been that everyone has their own different reasons for getting inked.</p>\n<p>J.J. Ortiz, one of the owners of downtown Santa Barbara’s 805 Ink, discovered his love for the art at a young age when he saw some older men tattooing in a backyard.<br>\nHe was hooked. The sound of the needles, the time spent with his neighborhood friends and the chance to be creative were addicting.</p>\n<p>“[Tattooing] didn’t look that hard,”  Ortiz said with a laugh. “I did my first tattoo on this girl in junior high. She wanted a “J” for this guy she liked, and they actually ended up getting married. It wasn’t good at all, but that was the beginning.”</p>\n<p>[media-credit id=20169 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"969699489\" data-slb-group=\"33472\"><img data-attachment-id=\"33476\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/cbf_16feb2011_tattoofeature-007/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?fit=2700%2C780&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2700,780\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XTi\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1297743431\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature 007\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?fit=250%2C72&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?fit=888%2C257&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007-250x72.jpg?resize=250%2C72\" alt=\"\" title=\"cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature 007\" width=\"250\" height=\"72\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33476\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?resize=250%2C72&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?resize=1024%2C296&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]Ortiz graduated high school, breezed through SBCC with straight A’s, received his bachelor’s degree and was set to be a teacher. But the itch to ink was persistent and soon he started working as an apprentice.</p>\n<p>“It’s constantly a learning process,” Jay said. “Every day is learning. Every tattoo counts.”</p>\n<p><em>And each person involved in the process counts. Every artist has a different forte; every customer a different vision.</em></p>\n<p>In his travels, Fulbeck said he noticed that some tattoos show obvious evidence of foresight while some seem more spur-of-the-moment. Some, like Amy Romeo, a second-year biopsychology major, incorporate their own designs and enduring life experiences into their work — as opposed to the much teased ‘tramp stamp’ effect.<br>\nRomeo creates her own artwork and recently started tattooing her friends. She illustrated the tattoo on her back, which pictures her ribcage as if layers of skin had been peeled back with a zipper, before it was inked by a tattoo artist.</p>\n<p>“[The drawing] was originally for my concentration portfolio in high school for my AP art class,” Romeo said. “We had to come up with a theme and a lot of my artwork ended up coming out with anatomy. I’ve always liked human anatomy; I find it fascinating.”</p>\n<p>These different ‘schools of tattooing,’ Fulbeck said, were evident across the globe.</p>\n<p>“There are those who get tattoos without putting much thought into what they want,” Fulbeck said. “Some people end up liking them, and some don’t. [The tattoos serve] as a scar on your body, kind of showing who you were at that time. It’s like a historical roadmap. Then there is the second school of people who wait and wait and wait and do their research, get to know different artists and then get the tattoo.”</p>\n<p>In Japan, he met several artists who emphasized the importance of the relationship between the tattoo artist and the tattooee. Fulbeck met Horitaka — now a close friend and the author of the foreword to “Permanence” — who introduced him to Horiyoshi III, the most renowned Japanese tattoo artist alive. In fact, Horiyoshi III gave Fulbeck a tattoo.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”PHOTO COURTESY OF Nicole Rogers” align=”alignleft” width=”199″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1219229395\" data-slb-group=\"33472\"><img data-attachment-id=\"33478\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/nicole/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg?fit=1008%2C1263&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1008,1263\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPhone\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1249075440\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"nicole\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg?fit=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg?fit=817%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole-199x250.jpg?resize=199%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"nicole\" width=\"199\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33478\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]“I think, especially in Japanese style, you have to have a relationship with the artist — you really have to synchronize,” Fulbeck said. “There is a tremendous amount of trust involved. I have an original piece of art on my back that burns with me after I die. I’m always indebted to Horiyoshi III for the work he did.”<br>\nWhen he came back from Japan, Fulbeck said, the prevalence of tattoo shops in the U.S. seemed to show a slightly more pop-culture tinge to American ink.<br>\nNonetheless, hordes of tattoo artists treat their craft with a seriousness matching the permanency of their art.<br>\nPat Fish of Santa Barbara-based LuckyFish Tattoo, a specialist in Celtic art, says she invests her time heavily into each tattoo assignment to connect on an individual level with each client.</p>\n<p>“I do a lot of research and find out what’s really meaningful to you,” Fish said. “Say you wanted a bird. If it came to it, I would go to the Natural History Museum to find the exact bird you wanted.”</p>\n<p>According to Fish, the majority of her clientele has been with her for 26 years, and respects her mastery of the tattoo so much that individuals will fly out from various parts of the world to get a new tat.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to do an art form that was a craft, and had immediate connection with the client,” Fish said. “No art gallery, no publisher, just me and the person for whom I was creating the art. I saw tattoos as having an ineluctable savor, providing a sign more permanent than almost anything else in life.”</p>\n<p>Fish said she takes the tattoo process seriously because of her personal values.</p>\n<p>“I’m really moral,” Fish said. “I believe I’m responsible for what I do in this life. If I’m putting a piece of art on [someone’s] back, it’s got to be good — I can’t have that bad karma. I do the best I can to be the agent of completion — people come to me with an idea, and I complete it.”</p>\n<p><em>The great thing about tattoos is that each one has its own flavor — a personalized blend of artist and recipient. Sometimes, a third party inspires or draws a tattoo before it is even taken to the artist to be inked.  Also the musculature of every human body varies enough that each tattoo is unlikely to ever be repeated.</em></p>\n<p>“The canvas is constantly moving,” Fulbeck said.</p>\n<p>Ali Obsorne, a second-year environmental studies major, said her tattoo placement was inspired by the nature of her design.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”PHOTO COURTESY OF Sonni Johnson” align=”alignleft” width=”152″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2043953081\" data-slb-group=\"33472\"><img data-attachment-id=\"33480\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/sonni2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?fit=847%2C1390&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"847,1390\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"sonni2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?fit=152%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?fit=624%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2-152x250.jpg?resize=152%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"sonni2\" width=\"152\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33480\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?resize=152%2C250&amp;ssl=1 152w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?resize=624%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?w=847&amp;ssl=1 847w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]“It’s a redwood leaf and I got it to symbolize where I grew up, which is Humboldt County, and we are famous for our redwood trees,” Osborne said. “I got it on my shoulder because I wanted it to look like it fell on my shoulder. I go to Sequoia Park a lot and the leaves always fall all over my body and hair, and I wanted one permanently on my body.”</p>\n<p>Romeo said she placed her tattoo  because it simultaenously apppears surreal and concrete as it is placed on her body.</p>\n<p>“It combined my love for art and the human body so it worked really well,” she said. “Also, it’s my art so I’m super close with it.”</p>\n<p>For others, tattoos serve as daily reminders. Ally Miller, a third-year black studies major and education and LGBTQ studies minor, said her ink is an admonition to find the simple pleasures in life.</p>\n<p>“In high school … our teacher assigned us a project called ‘Carpe Diem,’” Miller said. “It was really meaningful to me; I was going through a lot at the time. I clung to the project as the one thing that really kept me going — that I woke up excited about in the morning. When I got to college, I wanted a symbol to remind myself about everything I was going through and how amazing the projects made me feel.”</p>\n<p>Some, like fourth-year communication major Angela Chandra who has an Ohm symbol on her side, see tattoos as a form of spiritual expression.</p>\n<p>“The symbol itself stands for truth love and divinity, and the balance between the awakened state and the dream state and it also captures the sound of the universe,” she said. “I knew I wanted one for a really long time.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano, who announced her decision at the UC Regents meeting at UC Los Angeles, took over as UC president after former President Mark Yudof resigned in 2013. She was the first woman to lead the 10-campus system and tackled several issues during her time in office, including legislation related to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in which the UC system </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-08/breaking-uc-files-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-for-unlawful-daca-repeal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sued the government on behalf of DACA recipients</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in September 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Napolitano received heavy criticism following the decision to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-18/regents-vote-to-increase-nonresident-tuition-by-762/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">raise nonresident tuition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and after the reveal of a </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-uc-audit-20170425-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">state audit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that found the president’s office was mismanaging money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also faced protests during her initial appointment due to her </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2013/07/21/napolitano-confirmation-draws-protests-six-arrests/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">previous position</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the U.S. Secretary of Homeland security. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Wednesday’s meeting, she thanked her fellow Regents, particularly Chair John Pérez, for all of their help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe the university is on a solid path forward,” she said during the meeting. “Challenges, however, remain. With many new board members, with a new government and what will be seven years of service behind me, I think the university will benefit from some fresh blood.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a phone call afterward with media outlets, Napolitano addressed her accomplishments, pointing out that she’s held tuition flat every year except for one and saying the president’s office has made “substantial progress” in implementing the audit’s recommended changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Members of the board and members of the public can [now] track the dollars in and the dollars out of the Office of the President in a better way,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Napolitano officially steps down next August, she said she wants to focus on the same efforts she has dedicated the past year to: increasing the number of degrees awarded, closing graduate gaps, strengthening sexual assault and sexual harassment policies, increasing availability of student housing and moving forward with UC’s goal to be carbon neutral and 100% reliable on renewable energy by 2025. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was announced on Tuesday that the UC is pulling its money out of fossil fuels, </span><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/university-of-california-system-divestment-fossil-fuels-886203/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divesting its $13.4 billion endowment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and $70 billion pension. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano denied in a phone call the claim that she was resigning due to health issues, explaining that she had gone through chemotherapy in 2016 and 2017 and is now cancer free. She reiterated that the average time for college presidents to serve is six years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After leaving her position, she will take a one-year sabbatical before resuming teaching at UC Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy in the fall of 2021. It is not known at this time exactly what classes or subject she will teach, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked if she would ever run for public office again, accept a cabinet-level position or accept a Supreme Court nomination, Napolitano said she has “no intention in those regards” but she would “never say never.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to Napolitano’s successor, Chair Pérez said he will soon release the names of those selected to handle the nationwide search for a new UC president. The search committee will include students, faculty and alumni representatives, among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pérez said the committee will be looking for a president who will help the university “maintain its role as the top public research university in the world and one that serves as the public mission the people of California have come to expect, and one that builds on the board’s commitment to expanding access and affordability.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

media outlets for accounts of wars the U.S. wages abroad, 61 students currently enrolled at UCSB have experienced military service firsthand. And for students like Antonio — who entered the Air Force shortly before 9/11, was dispatched to Afghanistan last summer and now awaits redeployment — war can mean something entirely too real, full of hardships and experiences that their civilian peers cannot fathom.</p>\n<p>A saddening phenomenon, Antonio said, is that even on the eve of Veteran’s Day, many students and community members question the merit of the holiday and project their disdain for the politics of the war onto the men and women who comprise the nation’s front lines.</p>\n<p><strong>The Choice to Serve</strong></p>\n<p>Dano Pagenkopf, who served in the navy from 1991-97 as a nuclear propulsion plant operator, said society often misinterprets soldiers’ reasons for signing onto the armed forces.</p>\n<p>“It’s okay to not like a cause, like be against the war in Iraq or Afghanistan,” he said. “But to take it out on individual soldiers — it’s not cool. People say, ‘oh they had a choice.’ It’s not like that. People join for various reasons … a lot of students get help from their parents [to fund their college education]. Some people can’t afford that luxury.”</p>\n<p>Army sergeant Tim Webster, a first-year psychology major who served from 2002-07, said enlisting was simply ‘the right thing to do.’</p>\n<p>“I think everybody should serve, however short the term may be,” Webster said. “The money for college was appealing. I wouldn’t be able to afford UCSB without it.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, navy veteran Matthew Lewis, who served from 2003-09, said he thought joining the military would allow him to travel the world.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t want to go to college yet,” Lewis, a second-year chemistry major, said. “It presented a good opportunity to see the world and learn something interesting, do something new with my life that my friends weren’t doing.” \tFormer E-5 naval sergeant Quincy Yamada, a fourth-year economics major whose unit was attached to an airwing onboard the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier, echoed Lewis’ sentiment.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”PHOTOS COURTESY OF Denver Dale and Quincy Yamada” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"617892915\" data-slb-group=\"29464\"><img data-attachment-id=\"29470\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/war-headlines/am2-aw-quincy-yamada-dn/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg?fit=611%2C498&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"611,498\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AM2 (AW) Quincy Yamada DN\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg?fit=250%2C204&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN.jpg?fit=611%2C498&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AM2-AW-Quincy-Yamada-DN-250x203.jpg?resize=250%2C203\" alt=\"\" title=\"AM2 (AW) Quincy Yamada DN\" width=\"250\" height=\"203\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-29470\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>“[What motivated me was] travel and an urge to get out of the bubble I was in,” Yamada wrote in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>According to Yamada, whose unit was responsible for search and rescue, combat search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare efforts, his squadron was the first navy-helicopter squadron deployed in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Antonio, currently a third-year sociology and global studies major, said watching his friends graduate college and sink into traditional nine-to-five careers was impetus to seek something else.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to do something that was bigger than myself,” Antonio said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Financial Aid Director Mike Miller said his experience enlisting in the army deviated from the norm because he joined the military to pursue athletic goals.

For me, the military filled that void … People think the military is all about war, but it has unique programs like the World Class Athlete Program.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Game Changer</strong></p>\n<p>The catastrophic events of 9/11 drastically altered the original mindset of most active duty members, pitching their early days of service into discordant confusion.\tRaymond Morua, a third-year political science major, joined the army months prior to the World Trade Center attacks. Morua, who was stationed in Germany for two years, Kosovo for six months and saw active combat duty in Iraq for one year and three months, said his initial plans to earn money for college and learn about different cultures were cast aside after 9/11.</p>\n<p>“When I joined, the invasion hadn’t happened yet — there was no war at the time,” he said. “I thought I would get to travel the world, go learn, get money. It didn’t turn out that way; I didn’t think I would be playing G.I. Joe. It was pretty surreal.”</p>\n<p>Antonio, who joined the Air Force one week before 9/11, said he and his troop waited an additional month before they were able to watch news clips of the terrorist attacks.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit name=”PHOTOS COURTESY OF Denver Dale and Quincy Yamada” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"709715723\" data-slb-group=\"29464\"><img data-attachment-id=\"29467\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-10/war-headlines/lollipops/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg?fit=1280%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"CYBERSHOT\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1100822578\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"9.3\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"lollipops\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lollipops-250x187.jpg?resize=250%2C187\" alt=\"\" title=\"lollipops\" width=\"250\" height=\"187\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-29467\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>“When Sept. 11 kicked off, my platoon thought it was a drill,” he said. “The next thing you know, it was real.
