Thus the</em> </em><em>taking into custody of Deleveau on March 9 was a detention only, and not an arrest.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE 4/10:</strong> Although Otis Dezjuan Washington identified himself as such, he is currently not enrolled as a UCSB student as initially reported in the press release.</em></p>\n<p>Last night, a stabbing occurred on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive at approximately 10:45 p.m., after which a large crowd surrounded the police officers who were investigating the scene and grew to become an “unlawful assembly,” resulting in the arrest of two UCSB students.</p>\n<p>The victim of the stabbing was a 20–year-old non-resident from Rhode Island, who was in Isla Vista visiting his brother, according to a press release from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. The perpetrator was Lompoc resident 18-year-old Kuriyan Summers-Dickinson, and the incident occurred after a fight broke out at the residence. The victim is currently in a stable condition at a local hospital, and Summers-Dickinson was arrested and charged with attempted murder, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>Following the stabbing, a large crowd accumulated around the deputies who were attending to the incident, and Isla Vista resident Otis Dezjuan Washington was found jumping on top of vehicles and arrested for “vehicle tampering and resisting arrest.” As police arrested Washington, more people crowded around the deputies and “began chanting and throwing bottles,” according to the press release, eventually resulting in an unlawful assembly with an estimated one thousand people. Law enforcement pushed back the crowd, using pepper spray and batons on those who refused to leave, resulting in the arrest of UCSB student Tomas Delaveau for battery on a peace officer.</p>\n<p>Public Information Specialist for the SB County Sheriff’s Office Kelly Hoover maintained that the crowd would not be considered a riot, but that it risked becoming one.</p>\n<p>“It was an unlawful assembly which could have turned into a riot,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Hoover said the crowd assembled as a result of being intrigued by Washington’s arrrest, and began shouting things like “Let him go,” and “Fuck the police.”</p>\n<p>“I believe they just saw that someone was being arrested, and they gathered around the deputies who were making the arrested and the handcuffed student,” Hoover said. “I think when it started out it was a couple hundred people, and then as they saw there was something happening more and more people gathered.”</p>\n<p>Hoover expressed frustration with the behavior of the crowd, saying the crowd restricted the law enforcement’s ability to keep the area safe.</p>\n<p>“It’s disappointing that when law enforcement is out there trying to keep people safe, to have individuals who are making that effort more difficult and being disrespectful to our law enforcement,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>A fourth-year resident of the 6600 block of Del Playa who requested to remain anonymous said she was disappointed with the crowd’s response to the police, given their role in keeping the community safe.</p>\n<p>“It is completely disrespectful and shameful for the crowd to have yelled such insults to our police officers, the ones who are working to control crimes such as the horrific rape that occurred this month. I’d like to feel safe in my community,” she said.</p>\n<p>Photos Courtesy of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>This story appeared as an online exclusive on Sunday, March 9, 2014.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54433\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54433\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-09/three-arrested-over-stabbing-and-unlawful-assembly/","id":3789,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3788,3787,3786],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to two cases of sexual assault — in addition to alcohol-related crimes and citations for trespassing and false imprisonment.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to two cases of sexual assault — in addition to alcohol-related crimes and citations for trespassing and false imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Local law enforcement have now released some of the details of a sexual assault incident that occurred on Friday night on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. According to IVFP Sergeant Mark Signa, deputies observed a girl sitting on a curb near the Isla Vista 7-11 crying and saying she had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p>“She was very upset and — interviewed by IVPF — she stated she had been sexually assaulted on Del Playa Drive after leaving a party,” Signa said. “The suspect is unknown. He was either a Middle Eastern or Asian male.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday morning, deputies responded to a trespassing report on 6500 Del Playa Drive at 11 a.m. A female resident reported that at around 1:30 am, an unknown male had entered her home through a bathroom window. She and her boyfriend found the suspect, a college-aged Hispanic male, in their bathroom and then escorted him outside. After seeing the UCSB emergency alert regarding a sexual assault, the couple contacted officials and reported the incident.</p>\n<p>Also on Saturday night, Signa said deputies stopped a Del Playa resident from falsely imprisoning some of his party guests, after he attempted to flee authorities and prevented them from entering his house.</p>\n<p>“On Saturday night, on the 6700 block of Del Playa after midnight, several males were making lewd comments from their residence to passersby [mainly females], and in violation of noise ordinance,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa states that when deputies attempted to make contact with the males, they ran inside the house and refused to answer the door.</p>\n<p>“After 30 minutes of attempting to convince residents to open the door, deputies observed a female attempting to leave but was being physically restrained. The door was forced open. Approximately 70 people were inside,” Signa said. “Two people were contacted inside that were trying to leave, but were not allowed to.”</p>\n<p>One resident was given a citation for obstruction of justice and a misdemeanor charge of false imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Between 11 p.m. on Saturday and 4 a.m. on Sunday, another sexual assault occurred at an unknown location. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office reported that a 19-year-old female UCSB student was beaten and raped by three suspects described only as “Asian males.”</p>\n<p>According to Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, before the incident, the victim was last seen walking alone between midnight and 12:30 a.m. near Embarcadero Del Mar and Segovia Road. The Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department is working alongside Isla Vista Foot Patrol and UC Police Department to locate the crime scene and suspects.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4:15 p.m. on Tuesday, County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue volunteers were called in to search for any evidence that could assist with the investigation. They also plan to search possible crime scenes in eastern Isla Vista and on the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>Hoover said the victim was released from the hospital Monday afternoon and is now with her family.</p>\n<p>The location of this assault and the suspects in both cases of sexual assault are still unknown.

After the incident, the student returned to her home in I.V., her roommate contacted police and she was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of her injuries and an examination, according to a press release. The other victim was a female of undisclosed age who was sexually assaulted behind a vehicle on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. The assault occurred near a party held on the same block in the early hours of Saturday morning. The assailant was described as a 5’6” male of “thin build” with dark hair and dark eyes who fled west — away from campus — after the assault, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Sherriff’s Office Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, the recent incident of sexual assault in which one victim was beaten, as well as raped, by a group of suspects is a particularly rare and severe case.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, reports of sexual assaults in Isla Vista are not uncommon; however, this is definitely an extreme case,” Hoover said in an email. “The incident underscores the importance of not walking alone, especially at night, and to do everything in your power not to put yourself in a situation where you could become a victim.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair of Take Back the Night — a campus group that supports victims of sexual assault — Kelty Kauffman, who is a second-year feminist studies and English double major, said the university and local law enforcement should do more to combat sexual assault on campus and in I.V., such as more educational campaigns.</p>\n<p>“There is never enough. The fact that we don’t teach a thorough discussion around consent to our freshmen is a problem,” Kauffman said. “When freshmen have to take Gaucho FYI, there’s a very minor portion on consent and I think that should be elaborated on because a lot of people don’t actually know what the definition of consent is.”</p>\n<p>While Kauffman said there is work being done to improve how the UC deals with sexual assault cases, she said there is still need for a change in how law enforcement treats rape cases and how victims are generally treated by society.</p>\n<p>“Currently, we enforce a culture of violence,” Kauffman said. “I have heard personal accounts of the police in Isla Vista not taking rape allegations seriously here and being condescending or dismissive of survivors, and that continues to contribute to a culture that tell survivors not to come forward with their stories and allows rapists to go free.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, Sheriff’s Deputies and UCPD Officers are seeking information throughout the Isla Vista area as well as around campus to help identify and locate the suspects with the assistance of a Sheriff’s K9 Unit.</p>\n<p>If you have any information on the cases, the Sherriff’s Office asks to call 9-1-1 immediately or to leave an anonymous tip call at 805-681-4171.
