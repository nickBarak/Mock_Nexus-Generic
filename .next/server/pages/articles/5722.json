During this hour-long conversation, the vlogger intimately discussed his rise to fame, experience as a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient and what it’s like dealing with crazy fans </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one of whom crashed the live session by exposing her bare breast on camera.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Associated Students (A.S.) Program Board members Gabriel Reyes and Nathaly Pacheco moderating the discussion, Dobrik was able to answer specific questions of relevance rather than relying on the hectic chat room, which filled up with hundreds of messages by the second. Perhaps one of the things that got so many people excited was the appearance of other beloved vlog squad members who have been with Dobrik since the beginning: Natalie Mariduena and Ilya Fedorovich. Both Mariduena and Fedorovich grew up alongside Dobrik in Chicago, Ill., and now live with him in their shared mansion in Los Angeles, Calif. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jumping right in, moderator Reyes asked Dobrik what the first thing is that he wants to do once this COVID-19 quarantine ends. Known for capturing both his and his friends’ antics on YouTube, were any of us </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> surprised when Dobrik replied with, “Probably go to the bars. I miss seeing my friends drink in public places”? Of course, after earning a laugh, Dobrik quickly followed this up with a more serious answer, explaining that he’s simply excited to get back to work.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing the conversation, Dobrik talked about his social media consumption, claiming that he’s got a special place in his heart for one app in particular: “I am probably the biggest fan of TikTok, and I hate saying this because I sound like I’m some sort of hipster, but I promise you, I was using it before it was cool.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As moderator Pacheco moved the discussion from TikTok to Dobrik’s YouTube career, Dobrik emphasized how important the element of stress was during his rise to internet fame. Although he claimed that his original schedule of posting vlogs three times a week got difficult to keep up with, the stress that came along with it ended up being the perfect amount of fire he needed to become the sensation he is today. “Moral of the story is, if you’re stressed out, keep going,” Dobrik said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, things got fun and lighthearted again as Reyes asked if Dobrik could show everyone his infamous </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nataliemachadoo/status/1262958639427416064\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flamethrower</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a gadget often used in his more daring vlogs. While we may have been happy with just seeing the instrument itself, Dobrik took it a step further and instantly put it to use (and, honestly, I was genuinely worried he might accidentally burn his house down). The gag was over in seconds, with Pacheco commenting, “I don’t think [the Zoom viewers] thought you’d actually do it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his meteoric rise in popularity, it’s no surprise that Dobrik often faces fanatic subscribers, who apparently show up at his doorstep quite frequently. “People show up to the house, and it’s so fucking scary. We hate it,” Dobrik said. While some experiences are more pleasant than others, like the time Dobrik ran into a guy who ended up playing John B in the recent Netflix series “Outer Banks,” Dobrik said that most of the time, it’s just downright uncomfortable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the topic of his most “memorable” fan encounters (and I say “memorable” with a grain of salt), Dobrik explained how every fan “thinks they’re the exception” when they show up to his home uninvited. One fan in particular, Dobrik explained, showed up to his house claiming that he needed to show Dobrik a video </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a video on how this man found out where Dobrik lives, how he followed Dobrik home from a party and so on. “Those situations are pretty sad and scary,” Dobrik said. “Once in a while, people just show up, and we think it’s our time to go.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about DACA and his current view on the political landscape, Dobrik explained how he wants his YouTube channel to be an escape from the hectic world outside the internet and not a place where his audience feels divided. “This sounds so cheesy, but it’s so true,” he said. “I just want [my channel] to be a place where people can just watch videos and forget what’s actually going on.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dobrik then recalled an instance when he was in Texas and met a number of students who are part of the DACA program, explaining how frustrating it was to see “everyday” people having to struggle when they contribute so much to society. As a DACA recipient himself, Dobrik said, “I have high hopes for all DACA people.” Although he kept his answers on these serious subjects somewhat short, it was clear Dobrik had much more to say.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the event, moderator Reyes added that his housemates (who are huge Dobrik fans) were all watching the livestream in a separate room. To this, Dobrik invited them to come join Reyes, where soon after, one of the housemates immediately pulled up her sweater to reveal her naked breast to Dobrik and everyone else watching at home. While most got a laugh from it, a few people on </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateGatsby/status/1263026527769251841\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> questioned the appropriateness of this act, wondering if it still would have been perceived as funny if it had instead been a man exposing himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this livestream was filled with several unforeseeable moments, Dobrik accomplished something great: He brought laughter and entertainment to an audience stuck at home during one of the craziest times any of us have had to face thus far. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

Last summer, I was able to take two online courses within the UC system: one at Berkeley and the other at Irvine. I am a nontraditional student and with this comes a great deal of experience. I have had a long history of brick-and-mortar college instruction followed by three solid years of exclusively online education. The current online class structure that UC Santa Barbara has hastily crafted falls decidedly short compared to that of other schools with less financial resources. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/regents-of-the-university-of-california-ucsb-spring-quarter-tuition-adjustment?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_20818766_en-US%3Av7&amp;recruiter=1069874194&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;utm_term=psf_combo_share_abi\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">public petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> circulating, with close to 7,000 signatures at the time I am writing this, in which students and their families are demanding a reduction in their spring quarter tuition fees. “I feel I am paying to teach myself,” and “Our tuition is the same, but the learning experience is sub-par” are some of the comments left on the petition. I cannot agree more. The infrastructure of UCSB’s online learning experience compared to that of the local community colleges, or even local high schools, has been inferior.

My brother attempted to make light of the situation: “Now you know what it’s like to have #haters,” he joked. But I couldn’t keep myself from refreshing the page, reading over and over again the dehumanizing words about my identity and experiences, looking through the profiles of the strangers who seemed to know me without ever trying. As I read lies and rumors about myself and my peers, the numbing ache in my stomach grew, but I was unable to tear my eyes away. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not like I’ve never received any sort of backlash before.

Yet in my experience, we are often harassed, bullied and excluded from progressive spaces on campus for our beliefs.

I am not afraid to speak my truth about issues that are important to me, and I am putting myself out there to run this campaign. I knew that displaying vulnerability would open the door for attacks on my character. However, the rest of my community, those who do not run for office or are hesitant to express themselves and those who just simply want to be accepted members of the student body, are just as affected by incidents like this.

They want to silence us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today’s society, it’s increasingly easy to pick a side hyper-fast and stick to it. To reference a saying I heard recently, conversation has become either meaningless or impossible.

When Senate meetings run for hours, Daily Nexus articles are flooded with anonymous comments full of slurs and baseless accusations and social media feeds are cluttered with ruthless campaigning and (not-so) subtle jabs at competitors, their faith in our ability to serve them dwindles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve turned into a reality show. At best, we’re the laughing stock of this campus; at worst, a waste of student fees. And when it comes to supporting our friends when it’s their turn to take the stage, we tear each other down. When elections come around, some of the most vocal people in our organization, who promise to uplift marginalized communities and uphold progressive values, are the ones who engage in this harmful behavior, stripping people of their complexities in their attempt to make them fit into their binary definitions of “good” or “bad.” Instead of fairly criticizing platform points and ideals, this has become a competition of whose identity is the most valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we expend so much energy fighting each other, we distract and become distracted from the fights that really matter — our graduate students are calling on us to support them, our balconies are collapsing while our landlords stay silent and the lawsuits against our UCPD are still stalled.

But Animal Crossing has reached </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/tech/nintendo-switch-animal-crossing-quarantine/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">its special kind of monumental success</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a two-fold reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason is that it’s creators have mastered the </span><a href=\"https://mymodernmet.com/kawaii-art-japanese-culture/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kawaii aesthetic</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Animal Crossing’s  endearing graphics and overall satisfying gameplay. Nintendo has long been a revolutionary titan in the video game industry, and Animal Crossing is just one of its exceptional successes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second is timing. Quarantine has the world flipped upside down. Nothing makes sense, and nearly everyone and their mothers are coping with the newfound anxiety of doing simple tasks (like going to the grocery store and spending sleepless nights wondering if they have enough Lysol wipes). This is an unprecedented time. Living through something like this is unimaginable and difficult to completely wrap your head around at times. But Animal Crossing has proven to be the unexpected antidote to it all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The melody of a wind chime plays. Your friends are fishing, catching butterflies and hunting for fossils. There’s not a single care in the world. There are bonfires on the beach, coconuts in the trees and the sunsets are colored in dreamy pastels. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living through something like this is unimaginable and difficult to completely wrap your head around at times. But Animal Crossing has proven to be the unexpected antidote to it all.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Animal Crossing today is what Bob Ross paintings were to the 80’s. Or maybe what Mr. Rogers was to the 70’s: singularly calming, serene and carefree. It’s the nonmedical treatment to the chaos that is our current cultural moment: a global pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first downloaded Pocket Camp, Animal Crossing’s smartphone app equivalent to the real game, I hoped it would cure my addiction to Solitaire and prove to be more interesting than Sudoku. Now, at Level 101 with a pimped-out campsite and tons of smartly dressed anthropomorphic friends, I think I can confidently say that I get the hype </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it’s real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve logged a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scary</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> amount of time on this app. When I say scary, I mean it’s too embarrassing to admit aloud. Let’s just say I’ve set alarms in the middle of the night to make sure my </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virtual</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> animal friends have enough lychee fruits and horned dynastids. I don’t even know what a dynastid is, but you can bet I’ll be tapping my phone like a psychopath at three in the morning to catch them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stigma around “gamers” is real, though. But the judgment that used to plague the idea of spending hours staring at a screen seems to be temporarily lifted thanks to the quarantine. There’s only so many Alexis Ren ab workouts I can attempt and whipped coffee one can make in a day. I’m on TikTok, applying to summer jobs on Handshake and becoming a real Martha Stewart in the kitchen, but nothing feels more satisfying or relaxing than playing Animal Crossing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pocket Camp is a judgement-free, Zoom-free, CNN-free zone. I don’t have to listen to the daily litany of lies our president rants about, I don’t have to read about the rise of death tolls without an end in sight, and I don’t feel guilty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quarantine is a uniquely strange time to begin new things, like learn a hobby, level up on Duolingo, save your GPA, go on virtual Bumble dates and an endless amount of self-care. But, most importantly, it’s a time to stop thinking that the things that give you pleasure are indulgent and unproductive. No one that’s alive has ever lived through anything like this. So use this time the way you want to, do the things that make you genuinely happy and add me on Animal Crossing. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pei Ja Anderson wants you to remember to have compassion for yourself.
