Neither did I until I watched “It.” Originally a TV-miniseries, this faithful adaptation of the book by Stephen King will leave you keyed up and on edge throughout its three-hour run time. “It” is a thriller-mystery following seven kids and later seven adults as they try to come to terms with supernatural events surrounding a killer clown named Pennywise. Ghouls and terrifying creations abound, and the movie’s theatrics are sure to make you look down every drain and up every spout. And, if you are worried about the movie running late, don’t worry. You’re not going to be sleeping anyway. Note: Coulrophobia refers to fear of clowns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9 Hours to Midnight —</strong> <strong> “The Conjuring” (2013)</strong></p>\n<p>Released with the likes of “Carrie” (2013) and “Dark Skies” (2013), “The Conjuring” is probably the best horror movie released in the four years since “Haunting in Connecticut” (2009). In spite of stiff competition and an atmosphere of rehashed movie topics in Hollywood, this movie has done wonders at the box office. Although the plot lacks in originality, the twists and the apparition makes this movie a must-see. Bone-chillingly fresh suspense keeps the pace of the movie onwards. Pro Tip: Conjure yourself an extra pair of pants before watching; you will need them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>16 Hours to Midnight — “The Hills Have Eyes” (2006)</strong></p>\n<p>It’s with happy <em>schadenfreude</em> that I present to you “The Hills Have Eyes.” Set in the Mojave Desert, a family of seven are hunted by a group of mutants looking for flesh and blood. This slasher/psychological thriller shocks the mind with grotesque violence and moments of adrenaline-fueled mayhem. Like any good horror movie, it strains against the limits of civility and pushes away common decency in a terrible display of death. Note: <em>Schadenfreude, </em>a German term, translates to “harm joy,” or pleasure at another’s misfortune.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>12 Hours to Midnight — “The Blair Witch Project” (1999)</strong></p>\n<p>Arguably the film that created the ‘found films’ genre of horror, “The Blair Witch Project” is a cult film in its own right. Its plot centers on a group of college students who enter the Maryland forest with cameras to track down the legendary Blair Witch, only to disappear. An investigation ensues and the main evidence discovered is the cameras. The story and unknown forces that haunt these students all add to the film’s scariness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8 Hours to Midnight — “The Shining” (1980)</strong></p>\n<p>How many times have you heard someone make a reference to this film in the last week? One time? Two times? Five times? This movie has thoroughly infected the horror genre’s consciousness. Led by legendary film director, Stanley Kubrick, this Stephen King novel-adapted movie is about a couple and their young son taking a winter vacation up in the Colorado mountain ranges to manage the Overlook Hotel. The story, albeit very unfaithful to the original novel, nevertheless haunts audiences throughout the world in its depiction of the Overlook Hotel. The characters are strong and the setting isn’t lacking in creepiness. The lack of detail and resolution sets a mysterious vibe that is difficult to shake off.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4 Hours to Midnight — “Mama” (2013)</strong></p>\n<p>“The Ring” (2002) meets “The Grudge” (2004) in “Mama.” Directed by master of horror Guillermo del Toro, “Mama” is about two girls that are discovered in a cabin in the woods four years after their father abducted them. Their uncle and his girlfriend take them in as adopted daughters, only to find that something else has also been invited in as well.</p>\n<p>“Mama” has a moving plot and a great character cast. Far from being simple props that get horribly slaughtered, the characters elicit sympathy and pity for their misfortunes. Of course, like any horror thriller, the tension is racked up constantly in the melancholy setting. Note: “Game of Thrones” fans, if you ever wanted to see Jaime Lannister take on creepy ghosts, then this is the film for you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Midnight — “Silent Hill” (2006)</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the video game that sparked the genesis of the Western horror genre, “Silent Hill” is responsible for multiple game adaptations, including one produced by Guillermo del Toro expected to be released in 2016, and another movie sequel, “Silent Hill Revelations” (2012). Not to be confused with the slasher-thriller, “The Hills Have Eyes” (2006), “Silent Hill” (2006) is about a mother who takes her adopted daughter up to the mountains of West Virginia. In her journey, she accidentally ventures into an otherworldly, surrealistic dimension, to find her daughter in Silent Hill. Full of occult-ish creatures, pyramid men and dead nurses, this movie is chock full of frightening twists and turns that will leave you unable to stay still. The visual special effects are spot-on and the atmosphere is sure to haunt you on foggy days. Take this journey down Silent Hill and you’ll never regret it — until you can’t sleep, of course.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Through this journey, I hope you learn all the twists and turns of your deepest nightmares. No doubt, if you follow this list, you will find yourself screaming in terror. Try not to regret the nightmares or the creepy feeling of being watched that will undoubtedly follow — be one with your dark passenger.</p>\n<p><em>Jon Choi will be watching all of these movies in the dorms of Montecito House.

Many of us have all the qualifications needed for a job, but are not hired because we fail to effectively market ourselves to employers. Is that our fault? Not really. Honestly, there aren’t that many places on campus to practice this invaluable skill. Having a stellar resume and a hard-earned bachelor’s degree proudly written at the top is only the first step to landing a job. But even if you have that, do you know where to send it? Do you have connections in HR departments at companies? I know I don’t. And I am frustrated that this school doesn’t do much to help foster those connections. How can I get across what I alone have to offer that no other college graduate has?</p>\n<p>I know I am not alone. Most students struggle with deciding how to best market themselves and prove their uniqueness because it isn’t easy. It requires an analysis of who you are and what you want. The most important thing to remember is to be true to yourself. Even if you are not currently seeking employment, it is still critical to have an “elevator pitch” prepared just in case you run into someone who works for your dream employer. An elevator pitch is a one-minute spiel that sums up who you are and what you have to offer. This is your personal brand that you should know by heart and be able to share confidently with others.</p>\n<p>Once you have your brand down, it’s important to build your network of connections. Many people will tell you that they heard about a job opening or even got hired because they had connections to the right people. As a UCSB student there do exist some connections to faculty and co-workers that we have honed over our years here. An expanded network means you have a greater chance that one of your connections leads to a job, internship or even just valuable career advice that changes your life. Plain and simple.</p>\n<p>The good news is it seems that my concerns have been heard. The Career Peers at Career Services are hosting a special event to help people like me learn how to market themselves and make connections. They’ve called their event “Brand Yourself for Success: A Night of Networking.” While this is their first attempt at doing something like this, it is nice to know that certain departments on campus really are concerned with making sure we go into the real world with a skill to help us land jobs. On Thursday, April 26, from 5 to 7 p.m. at Mosher Alumni House, they are bringing in a keynote speaker to lecture on how to brand yourself for the job market. Following the lecture, they are bringing in over 20 employers from different industries as well as some faculty to listen and critique how we come across and our first impressions. From what they say, the event is aimed at providing valuable feedback on how well we are selling ourselves. The best part is that it is an opportunity to practice networking with professionals in a setting where they are completely focused on meeting you and helping you.</p>\n<p>This event is a valuable opportunity for UCSB students to improve their professional image. Because lecture space is limited, those who want to attend must RSVP on GauchoLink by Thursday, April 19, to reserve a spot. So take advantage of this chance to develop your personal brand and mingle with professionals; I know I will.</p>\n<p>Sarah Puckette is a fourth-year zoology major and A.J.

Don’t worry, I’ve hotwired just as many cars as you have. I’m no criminal genius and have no desire to be one. I was probably just admiring the new make and model of that shiny Lexus.

I don’t own a switchblade and have never even shot a gun. I probably have no greater access to deadly weapons than any other 19-year-old with an Internet connection and student debt.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I’m probably just reaching into my sweatshirt for my cell phone so I can call up my mom or girlfriend or maybe just check the latest sports scores. Maybe I’m digging into my jean pockets for some gum or candy or cigarettes that I picked up so I can enjoy a pointless habit. Or I could be looking to arm myself with my iPod so I can change the song to Bob Marley, or Marvin Gaye, or Lynyrd Skynyrd, or the Beatles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So don’t be scared, homie.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I’m probably just walking home so I can watch the All-Star game with my father and little cousin. Because I have family too, filled with lots of young black men who will grow up with your suspecting eyes constantly leering at them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But we like candy and iced tea and cell phones. We love to watch hockey, sometimes listen to country music and think about God and family. And even if that’s bullshit, we still wouldn’t want to rob you because I’d like to believe people are good. I’d like to believe that we don’t have enough hate and fear in us to kill and rob a stranger. And I’d like to believe you believe that too.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So don’t be scared, homie.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>David Washington is a second-year political science major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45888\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-06/im-normal-guy-dont-scared/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45888\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-06/im-normal-guy-dont-scared/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-06/im-normal-guy-dont-scared/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-06/im-normal-guy-dont-scared/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-06/im-normal-guy-dont-scared/","id":6050,"author":{"id":307,"name":"David Washington"},"related":[6049,6048,6047],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Putting Our Inner Hipster Aside, Coming to Terms With Bieber Fever","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Have you ever woken up one morning and realized you’re the hipster?

But every day I feel like more and more of us are formulating our own stubborn opinions about music, television, pop culture and the like.</p>\n<p>For example, I have to acknowledge Justin Bieber has talent. Of course he does. I just don’t buy his music because it’s not my thing. I don’t mean anything personal by it and I don’t think I’m supposed to fall under the Belieber demographic anyway. That said, the boy can dance and carry a tune all right from what I can tell. That fact doesn’t concern his haters. The language that dudes my age use to describe this poor kid is nothing short of volatile.

I have never listened to a single Nickelback song, but I still have the luxury of knowing they’re the worst band in the entire world. I’m perfectly aware that that poorly formulated opinion came right out of the ether. Furthermore, it’s my prerogative to perpetuate that belief via a cowardly tweet and/or wall post. Thanks, society.</p>\n<p>In the age of the internet and social networks, it’s near-impossible to express genuine sincerity for something without a snarky retort from a cynical 15-year-old in a dark room somewhere. If I took my baby cousin to see The Lorax, I wouldn’t think about admitting to liking it. The only acceptable review is, “Fucking sucks … blah blah blah … Goddamn Hollywood … blah blah blah …” in a sardonic circle of guys smoking Camel crushes with their hoodies up to keep the sunlight and earnestness out of their eyes.</p>\n<p>When did we all get so bitter and jaded? Did this happen overnight or has it always been like this? With reality shows snatching the highest ratings on television and dance pop effortlessly topping the charts, everyone is ready to believe that their taste alone is impeccable. It’s a frightening and polarizing way to think and I don’t see it stopping anytime soon.</p>\n<p>When Conan O’Brien left The Tonight Show after the time slot controversy, he asked something of the young people in his final farewell: “Please do not be cynical. I hate cynicism; for the record, it’s my least favorite quality. It doesn’t lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get.” This is a sentiment I’ve since tried to live by. Bear in mind, it was said by someone who was muscled out of a late night institution most comedians only dream of. If Conan can still keep the faith after that experience, I’m not gonna let flashy pop stars or silly kids’ movies get me down.</p>\n<p>Where is the love?</p>\n<p><em>Dash Nye is a third-year film and media studies major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46055\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-12/putting-hipster-coming-terms-bieber-fever-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46055\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-12/putting-hipster-coming-terms-bieber-fever-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-12/putting-hipster-coming-terms-bieber-fever-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-12/putting-hipster-coming-terms-bieber-fever-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-12/putting-hipster-coming-terms-bieber-fever-2/","id":6051,"author":{"id":514,"name":"Dash Nye"},"related":[6050,6049,6048],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
