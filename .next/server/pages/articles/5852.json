","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rarely does a film come along that induces headaches quite like Pablo Larraín’s “Jackie.” It’s not the kind of headache that comes from watching an unbearable film, but the kind that emerges when a film knows how to string its audience along its ever-increasing and stressful devolution. “Jackie” is a remarkable feat in atmosphere and character analysis, but it forgoes its story and structure in favor of an intense, and at times over the top, psychological slideshow of cut and paste moments from the life of a political widow.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, First Lady Jackie Kennedy, played by Natalie Portman, contemplates her place in a world without the man she had so often been defined by. Terrified by the thought of becoming forgotten in the depths of history, Jackie works to solidify her husband’s legacy as an American icon. But through her attempts to become immortalized, she slowly begins to lose her grip on both her identity and sanity in the face of cultural irrelevance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With its focus on tone and character, “Jackie” takes some liberties with its narrative structure. The plot jumps from flashback to flashback, changing its location in time as frequently as it changes its positioning of narrative moments. The film is framed by an epilogue to the plot in the form of an interview that details Jackie’s mindset more than her actual recounting of specific narrative events. This jarring back-and-forth from contemplation to varying glimpses into the events following the assassination, prevents the audience from being able to watch a chronological story of Jackie’s descent into slight madness. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackie is always found to be in a state of distress, locking the film into a perpetual neurotic state. With such a lack of narrative progression, the film dances the line between becoming surreal and lazy. With each and every glimpse into the week following JFK’s assassination, we are treated to an overwhelming and frustrating feeling of déjà vu. Each scene feels and looks the same, with Jackie showcasing her unraveled mind amidst a materialistic environment. There is no way to escape Jackie’s situation, and we as an audience are stuck with her in this disturbingly surreal hell. The déjà vu is further established with the cinematography and soundtrack. The shots are absolutely stunning, alternating between long and ornate frames to close and claustrophobic tracking. These two styles trade off and repeat scene after scene. The score is chilling, uncomfortable and completely nauseating. Just like the cinematography, the score repeats itself over and over again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the repetition that makes the film such a fantastic headache. Having the cinematography and soundtrack paired with the monotonous narrative design, the film presents a woman stuck in limbo, unable to move on with her life. There isn’t a clear progression of character development or of plot advancement, and this delay bleeds into the redundant and nauseating feeling that nothing is progressing or moving forward, that Jackie herself is stuck in the moment that follows her husband’s death.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the most impressive aspect of the film is the character presentation. While it can be seen as one-dimensional, Natalie Portman no doubt gives one of the most haunting performances of the decade. There is a perfect comparison to be made between her Jackie Kennedy and Daniel Day-Lewis’ Daniel Plainview. Both are at times overacted, but they are both so incredibly dedicated and disturbed that their overindulgence in performance is overshadowed by the perfection of their craft. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, “Jackie” excels in creating one of the most unnerving atmospheres seen in recent cinema. With its troubling yet beautiful score and familiarized repeating scenarios, “Jackie” creates a world in which time has completely stopped. Director Pablo Larraín successfully immerses the audience into his twisted vision, trapping us with Jackie as she attempts to escape her nauseating horror through the immortalization of her dead husband. The images and moments presented are truly haunting, but its two-hour run time begins to exhaust its overdone themes and moral quandaries by the overstuffed final fourth of the film. “Jackie” never quite hammers home these themes or moral questions, but instead allows them to linger in uncertainty for the audience to contemplate long after it is over. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures have a track record for bringing compelling presentations to the school and its sphere to enrich both students and the community, and their lineup for the Fall 2016 season has a gem for every ear and eye.</p>\n<p>In celebration of their centennial anniversary, the Granada Theatre downtown will host a free screening of six-part docuseries “The National Parks: America’s Best Idea” this Saturday and Sunday the 24 and 25. The series delves into the complicated history of the parks’ development from the 1850s on and elucidates the case for conservation of the nation’s treasured resources and landscapes. As a supplement, series writer and producer Dayton Duncan comes to Campbell Hall on Nov. 15 to speak on how the National Park idea and project has developed; Duncan is just one of many speakers visiting this season in the National Parks series.</p>\n<p>Other programs on the lineup celebrating the wonders of natural spaces include a flight of short films by Telluride Mountainfilm on Oct. 20, and a pair of National Geographic Live events, where wildlife filmmaker Bob Poole will demonstrate his conservationist work in Mozambique (Oct. 30) and photojournalist Brian Skerry his own in the world’s oceans (Nov. 20). All take place right here in Campbell Hall.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Samples from A&amp;L’s impressive slate of musical acts include performances by soul saxophonist Maceo Parker, known for his work with legends like James Brown, Parliament-Funkadelic and Prince, on Oct. 27 at Campbell.

Having worked with titans like Yo-Yo Ma and Madonna, Buck promises to impress with his genre-melting flurry of hip-hop, jazz, ballet and modern.</p>\n<p>Comedy fans, i.e., people, will be glad to chuckle at “Whose Live Anyway?,” the live and on-the-road version of beloved improv show “Whose Line.” Show-goers can count on shouting suggestions at series regulars Greg Proops and Ryan Stiles on Nov. 9, and might even get to join them on the Granada stage. Comedy podcast king Marc Maron of “WTF” fame will bring his darkly honest humor to a stand-up set at Campbell Hall on Oct. 21.</p>\n<p>Virtually all of these events are ticketed at a discounted price of $10-$15 for students, but for many of us that indulgence can be denting. A&amp;L’s free events this season include the aforementioned screenings of the National Parks docuseries, and a presentation at Campbell from photographer Q.T. Luong showcasing his stunning work capturing these protected lands on Nov. 2. Free screenings include “Sonita,” the story of a Tehran teen with aspirations to be the next Rihanna (Nov. 30 at Campbell), and “Screenagers,” a doc exploring the psychology of excessive tech time on the developing brain (Oct. 16, Arlington).

other movie goers on Friday evening as they eagerly awaited the commencement of the screening of “Swiss Army Man.” For only $4, the event, hosted by UCSB’s Magic Lantern Films, boasted a night of tasty snacks, interesting trivia, themed prizes and, most importantly, an appearance by Daniel Scheinert, one of the directors of the film. The event delivered, with an arsenal of buttery complimentary popcorn at the entrance, a plethora of film posters and a swiss army knife, ready to be given away to lucky prize winners. Upon stepping into the screening area, the first sight was that of the night’s special guest, who looked nearly indistinguishable from the college students who surrounded him, chatting to a large group of curious and attentive viewers.</p>\n<p>“Swiss Army Man,” which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in January, follows the story of Hank, played by Paul Dano (“Little Miss Sunshine” and “Love and Mercy”), who is stranded on a desert island. He discovers a corpse named Manny, played by Daniel Radcliffe (of Harry Potter fame), whose body has special powers. Hank manipulates Manny’s powers, which consist of a number of odd bodily functions, to navigate their way back home. Throughout their hilarious and heartfelt journey, Hank teaches Manny what it is like to be alive and Manny reminds Hank of what it is like to not be alone.</p>\n<p>The movie thrived off of its disarming and offbeat humor, in a series of uncomfortably funny moments in which Manny attempts to understand and adapt to the conventions of the world. Yet, it displays a vulnerable, raw human connection between Dano’s lonely and undeniably relatable Hank and Radcliffe’s compassionate corpse.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The film was written and directed by Scheinert and his creative partner Daniel Kwan, who, together, call themselves The Daniels. This is Scheinert and Kwan’s first feature film. However, the two previously garnered internet fame through their innovative music videos for artists such as Foster The People and The Shins. One of their more terrifically absurd videos, created for Lil Jon’s song “Turn Down for What,” was even played before the screening of the film. Second-year Erin Sim remarked, “It was so interesting to see how their style translated from the music videos to the big screen. It was obvious some of their previous work influenced the movie, especially in terms of the special effects.”</p>\n<p>Following the screening, Scheinert climbed onstage as T. Rex’s “I Love to Boogie” blasted through the speakers of the auditorium. He explained that he “drove down from L.A. with a bunch of [his] friends with that song on repeat throughout the whole trip,” and expressed his newfound distaste for it. During a Q&amp;A session, he mentioned that the film contained many musical inside jokes much like that one, including a ballad rendition of “Cotton Eye Joe” performed by the directors’ friends, Manchester Orchestra, and the frequently hummed tune of Jurassic Park. “I always hum that or ‘Kiss from a Rose,’ by Seal, [while working with Kwan],” Scheinert joked.</p>\n<p>The audience was graced with tidbits of trivia, including how the appearance of a fictional creature in the film came to be. “Daniel Radcliffe’s bodyguard dressed up as Bigfoot one day and just ran in the back of shots,” Scheinert revealed. And when asked where the multitude of fart sounds littered throughout the movie were obtained, he chuckled, replying, “I guess it’s kind of illegal, but we actually took tracks from this video online called ‘101 Real Farts’ … We wanted the farts to be unique, because every one was supposed to be a character development moment.” As the audience roared with laughter, he expressed his hopes that “someone will recognize their own fart in [the] movie.”</p>\n<p>One audience member commended Scheinert on the impact of the film, explaining that they had gotten up to go to the bathroom during the middle of the movie, but upon seeing “everyone in pure awe, laughing and smiling” they rethought their decision. Scheinert alluded that the film’s creation process was similar: hard to abandon. He advised aspiring filmmakers to “make sure your movie is fun to make,” and to treat it like “a therapy project.”</p>\n<p>“This was one of the best audiences I think we’ve seen,” said Stephanie Lynch, Scheinert’s girlfriend. “It was a really great group of people. Everyone was so into it; it was really cute.”</p>\n<p>The turnout seemed to impress a fair few people. “This was one of the best [screening experiences] we’ve ever had,” said Magic Lantern producer DJ Palladino. “There were these guys from Ventura who made [‘Bellflower’], which The New Yorker called ‘the future of cinema’ and these guys came and they were amazing, and there were only twenty-five people in the audience. ”</p>\n<p>The evening ended in a way left up to individual interpretation, much like the film did, when Scheinert was asked what the point of “Swiss Army Man” was. Implying it was a reflection of his and Kwan’s journey as filmmakers, he added, “It’s sort of about how we all make up movies in our head.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

through a kaleidoscope whilst tripping on enough acid to give Eric Clapton pause. In its best moments, the magic-centric movie is a colorful, mind-rending ride through the cracks in time and space, bringing us through a wide palette of dimensions and folding New York City all over itself in moments reminiscent of “Inception,” something which a patron several seats away from me loudly noted to her friend.<br>\n“Doctor Strange,” however, is not an avant-garde movie; it is the newest Marvel superhero film (for those of you who live under a rock or think that the movie was directed by Stanley Kubrick). The protagonist is Stephen Strange, a brilliant neurosurgeon not quite brilliant enough to know that looking at your iPad while driving really fast on a bendy road tends to give you a bad case of death. After getting into a car wreck that would kill anyone not played by Benedict Cumberbatch, he embarks on a spiritual journey in the hopes of mending his mangled hands, encountering a host of mystics and magicians, including the redeemed warrior Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) who is ancient.<br>\nThere are a couple things I like about Stephen Strange. Just to get it out of the way, Cumberbatch is, of course, excellent in the role. Also, he looks the part; during the pre-show entertainment, a bit of trivia revealed the character was designed to resemble famous horror actor Vincent Price. Cumberbatch certainly bears quite a resemblance to the late actor, having grown a goatee that ought to be encased in glass. His costume, like that of characters like Iron Man and Ant-Man, is also quite functional in addition to looking absolutely badass. I do not jape when I say that his cape is one of the film’s best characters. One of the best things about the character is that he has a good character arc that you get invested in, although, admittedly, when you get down to it, this arc can be pretty much summed up as him growing out of being a complete dick.<br>\nTo whom is he a dick? Pretty much everyone initially, including his love interest, Christine, played by Rachel McAdams. She serves as a fun comedic foil to Strange and complements him well enough, but she never quite became an interesting character in her own right. Nor did the villain Kaecilius, whose name I had to go on Wikipedia to type and sounds like some kind of nasty medical condition. Despite his fairly eye-catching power to make swords that look like they’re made out of light, he is the usual dark mirror Marvel baddie, serving as a villainous reflection of Strange. He’s the possibility of what the hero would be if he went down the dark path. Oy vey. Been there, done that. The fact that I was far more invested in Mads Mikkelsen when I saw him in the “Rogue One” trailer that I’d already seen several times before should tell you enough.<br>\nThe fact of the matter is that “Doctor Strange,” despite its absolutely incredible CGI work, leaves a bit to be desired in the writing department. The secondary characters especially could have used a little more polish, as a lot of them had some pretty vague motivations, and one ended up changing allegiances faster than Anakin Skywalker after killing Mace Windu. But the script is by no means horrible. We still get some damn good one-liners and, while generic, the story never manages to become confusing or dull.<br>\nAll in all (wow, haven’t used that since elementary school), the film is mostly on par for the course in Marvel’s case. “Doctor Strange,” despite some pretty noticeable flaws, is still a bunch of fun to watch, with the quips we’ve come to expect from Marvel, an awesome titular hero and probably the best creative onscreen visuals the company has put out to date.<br>\nTake notes, DC.  If you screw up John Constantine, I will come after you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/doctor-strange-a-fun-magical-ride/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/doctor-strange-a-fun-magical-ride/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/doctor-strange-a-fun-magical-ride/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/doctor-strange-a-fun-magical-ride/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/doctor-strange-a-fun-magical-ride/","id":5851,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5850,5849,5848],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
