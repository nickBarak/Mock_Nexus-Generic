I’m excited and honored to announce that tonight we can continue and uphold that legacy with some of the most radical organizers I know,” Gessesse said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gessesse urged students in attendance to support the hosts through Patreon, the content creator crowdfunding service, as few publicly funded resources exist for this kind of political education, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without the funds we really can’t be free and educate our people, which is something I really admire about their labor,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham, in his opening remarks, addressed the audience on his and Simons’ intention to establish a safe and inclusive space for the duration of their show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Definitely want to start by acknowledging this room is a safe space for all Black folks, we’re not free until all of us are free. If you’re not with that shit, y’all know where the exits are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham said he decided to start the podcast after graduating with a degree in journalism and spending a week with his mentor in New York, who was already a podcaster. He recalled being repulsed that the superficial commentary and focus on trivial issues by white men received obscenely high compensation, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All I seen was hella white men talking about shit that didn’t matter. It’s disgusting when you see how much white folks get paid for their bad ideas,” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham and Simons called attention to their organization, the People’s Breakfast Oakland, stating that merely talking about Black issues was inadequate when people are not addressing material needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important that we engage in these communities that we claim to serve … what are you doing besides just talking about shit?” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tradition for the podcast, Parham and Simons began the night with their segment called “Black Joy,” where the co-hosts highlight a recent positive experience in their lives in-between episodes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A part of the Black burden is life being constantly born into the struggle, everything we do is politicized, everything we do gotta be serious [and] everything we do gotta be for liberation,” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the reasons why we start the podcast [this way] is to center joy and having joy in the movement is important. Black joy, not that white shit, that hella Black joy,” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons then addressed the contradiction of being an individual Black student charting their own educational path, particularly in a predominantly white institution, with the reality that the mass struggle of Black people is why they are allowed to attend, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We go to these institutions but what is the institution telling us to do? Who is the institution training us to become? Are we going to get a degree and work at Goldman Sachs or are we going to get a degree and help our people?” Simons said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a recurring theme throughout the live show; Simons and Parham said that as educated, radical organizers, they believe in the importance of Black students putting into practice the knowledge they gain in higher education in order to benefit their communities.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What can you do as a Black student to advance the next generations of people, because there will [always] be another 18-year-old or 17-year-old. How can you make this campus more inclusive to them?”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons brought up his time as a BSU organizer at UC Berkeley, and Parham discussed his reporting of the BSU’s fight for institutional change at the university to benefit Black students. These actions led to the creation of the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham encouraged students to remain resolute and aware of the importance of their activism and its precedent in the Black struggle, claiming “don’t let these crackers sway you, period, point blank.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In thinking about Black students and [their] activism, we really have to demand and always keep carrying that torch forward because when we stop carrying that torch, Black students are going to drop off,” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What can you do as a Black student to advance the next generations of people, because there will [always] be another 18-year-old or 17-year-old. How can you make this campus more inclusive to them?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair commented on the developing situation and statement from the UCSB’s BSU Demands Team, who have been fighting for a black resource and development center over the past 50 years. UCSB recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">addressed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and agreed to meet several of the BSU’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons advised Black students to fight for their people on and off-campus as well, thinking about those who cannot afford to attend college. Simons reiterated his and Parham’s stance on Black students using their education to advance the cause of their people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you can’t explain these theories that you’re learning to your cousin or to your grandma, what good is that theory? What good is talking if you ain’t taking action?” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hosts then offered their thoughts on the forthcoming election campaigns for President of the United States, particularly on Kamala Harris. The duo made clear their denunciation of </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/19/kamala-harris-2020-election-top-cop-prosecutor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her politics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, skeptical of other current black leadership and critical of purely elections-based politics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of us as Black people can’t seem to recognize anti-Blackness and white supremacy outside of whiteness,” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham added, before pressing further into the subject, that a rejection of any commentary about Kamala Harris that is grounded in misogynoir, which is sexism or misogyny targeting Black women specifically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham and Simons had harsh words for Barack Obama as well, believing that he furthered an oppressive system that subjugates people that look like him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It’s] strategic, I always tell people ‘Obama was the best chess move for white supremacy,’ because you can put a Black face on it and it’s still going to do its job,” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two weaved together past and contemporary history, using the words of Black leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X to highlight their thoughts regarding integration and the dichotomy of</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zLQLUpNGsc\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the ballot or the bullet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons concluded with some words about the power of history, and its necessity in understanding the trajectory of revolutionary struggle and the questions which arise from this process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We come from a perspective, a revolutionary perspective, right? When we think about these systems we have to understand the history, it ain’t just an individual,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why can’t we have free food, why can’t we have free healthcare, why can’t we have free housing, why do we give billions and billions of dollars to Israel to fund the occupation of Palestine, but we have people here living on the streets?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon said that Black people must ultimately ask, “What does it mean to be a revolutionary?”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.

However, the sheer ease with which Bayern dispatched Barcelona illustrates the gulf in class between the two teams.</p>\n<p>Madrid was able to make the second leg against Dortmund interesting with two late goals at the Santiago Bernabeau, but the final result was never really in question as Los Blancos were unable to close the gap that striker Robert Lewandowski created with his four first leg goals.</p>\n<p>A common debate between soccer fans over the past few years has over which league is better, La Liga or the English Premier League? La Liga supporters argued that Spain had the best league because it has the two best teams: Real Madrid and Barcelona. EPL supporters argued that England was the best because it had better teams top to bottom than any other league.</p>\n<p>I think that argument can be put to rest, for now at least.</p>\n<p>With Bayern and Dortmund meeting each other in an all-German Champions League final, it is clear that the German giants are the best teams in the world. Gone are the days where German soccer was criticized for being too mechanical and boring.</p>\n<p>Sure, one of the main reasons Bayern dominated Barcelona was due its massive size and speed advantage across the board. Most of Barcelona’s players are less than six feet tall and are not the prototypical athletes. However, for years Barcelona has wiped the floor with bigger, stronger and faster teams. To beat them, Bayern created a game plan and implemented it to perfection: absorb the pressure, don’t let the ball go inside the box, and hit Barcelona fast and hard on the counter. With a staunch defense and two of the best wide players in the world in Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, Bayern was able expose Barcelona where it is the weakest.</p>\n<p>The humiliating 7-0 loss on aggregate may ultimately be the turning point for Barcelona, signifying the end of what was perhaps the greatest team run in sports history. The Blaugrana won La Liga three straight seasons from 2008-11 and won the Champions League in both 2009 and 2011, leading many pundits to label them as the best team of all time.</p>\n<p>However, with two of their most instrumental players Xavi Hernandez and Carles Puyol reaching the end of their careers and a defense that disappoints on a regular basis, it may be time for Barcelona to consider rebuilding.</p>\n<p>Some may say that I am overreacting, that all Barcelona needs is a couple players here and there and they will again be considered the best team in the world. That would perhaps be enough if all Barcelona was concerned about was winning La Liga. However, Barça and their fans are not content with domestic success; they need to have success in Europe as well. And with Bayern only getting better this summer with the acquisition of young German playmaker Mario Gotze from, ironically, Borussia Dortmund, and Madrid lining up bids for Tottenham’s Gareth Bale and Napoli’s Edinson Cavani, Barcelona will have an even steeper hill to climb to get back to the Champions League Final.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, on May 25 in Wembley Stadium, the world will get to see the new brand of German soccer that is being played: fast paced, exciting, but most of all, dominant.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of en.wikipedia.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/germany-takes-over-soccer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/germany-takes-over-soccer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/germany-takes-over-soccer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/germany-takes-over-soccer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/germany-takes-over-soccer/","id":3195,"author":{"id":291,"name":"Austin Richardson"},"related":[3194,3193,3192],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sports Sensations: The Best of the Best","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Tebow-npr.org_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Tebow-npr.org_.jpg?resize=948%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Professional sport is first and foremost entertainment, and marketing is the backbone of any successful entertainment industry.

We’ve all seen it, heard it and read it. John Lennon famously once said that The Beatles were bigger than Jesus, and at the time, not many were inclined to debate that with him. Since the emergence of ESPN and the boom of sports media, we’ve seen countless ascents into stardom that would make Michael Jackson blush and Babe Ruth spit out his beer in shock. So here they are: the top five sports sensations in recent memory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>5. “Tebow-mania,” Tim Tebow, Quarterback, Florida Gators and Denver Broncos</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As far as pure popularity goes, Timmy Tebow should probably be higher on this list. The guy branded public prayer for God’s sake (pun intended). He might have been the most successful quarterback in college football history, and after being written off as a future tight end by draft analysts, he still got drafted in the first round. The legend only grew when he was given credit for willing his Broncos to a playoff victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers, despite being the worst quarterback in the league. However, a quarterback needs to be able to throw the ball, and Tebow still hasn’t figured it out, leading to his release by the New York Jets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>4. “Lin-sanity,” Jeremy Lin, Point Guard, New York Knicks and Houston Rockets </b></p>\n<p>Lin-sanity is yet another example of the power of the New York media. The kid from Harvard came out of nowhere (fourth string on the Knicks depth chart to be precise) to take the league by storm. Before getting hurt, Lin strung together a streak of 20-point games that made him the most popular Asian-American basketball player since Yao Ming. Unfortunately, the madness that captured the nation was short-lived. Lin’s injury and departure to Houston cut the buzz short right at its peak. Even though Lin had a great season, the smaller market and role as second fiddle to James Harden has cooled the number of #linsanity’s that emerged last year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>3. “MT Hammer,” Mike Trout, Outfielder, Los Angeles Angels</b></p>\n<p>Alright, so MT Hammer is kinda catchy, but it doesn’t have the universal recognition of the other names on this list. However, Mike Trout had the best rookie season in professional sports history. The 20-year-old kid would have and probably should have won the AL MVP award after leading baseball in multiple statistical categories, including Wins Above Replacement. And when the actual winner also won the Triple Crown, that’s a hell of a distinction. Trout does everything you can ask for from a baseball player: showing gold glove defense, elite speed and possibly the best bat in the game. If not for the Angels missing the playoffs, Trout would have been the biggest thing to hit baseball since the ballpark hot dog.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>2. “The Next Pele,” Neymar da Silva Santos Junior, Forward, Santos (Brazil)</b></p>\n<p>Neymar is the name on this list who might be the most unknown to the average American sports fan. But make no mistake, Neymar is the most popular athlete in the world. Neymar is on the cover of video games, the star of comic books and the seventh richest soccer player in the world after receiving massive endorsement deals at the age of 17. The 21-year-old sensation from Brazil won his first of back-to-back South American Footballer of the Year awards in 2011 at the age of 19 and has already drawn comparisons to Pele and Lionel Messi. In fact, Pele himself said that Neymar is already better than Messi, sparking the debate to who is in fact the best player in the world. Prepare to hear more about the young phenom, as it was announced last week that Neymar is ready to end his loyal relationship with his original club and make his long-anticipated move to Europe, with Barcelona in the lead for his services.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>1. “Fernando-mania,” Fernando Valenzuela, Pitcher, Los Angeles Dodgers</b></p>\n<p>I know this article promised the top rises to stardom in recent memory, but Fernando was the original phenom and deserves the spot atop this list. In 1981, at the age of 20, Valenzuela won his first eight starts for the Dodgers, and the biggest baseball craze of the last 50 years had begun. Fernando’s youthful energy and enthusiasm, historic popularity, especially among the Latino community in Southern California, and all-time great screwball captured the attention of the nation. The timing was perfect as well, with ESPN only a couple years old and in prime position to fuel the fire. 1981 might have been Fernando’s best season, with the Dodgers winning the World Series and the pitcher winning Rookie of the Year and the NL Cy Young award. But the mania lasted throughout the 80s, with Fernando winning 21 games in 1986 and pitching a no-hitter in 1990. Without injuries derailing his career in the early 90s, Fernando might have gone down as one of the greatest pitchers of all-time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not

music major from UCSB in 2018 and has since worked to help local animals in need.</p>\n<p>“Right around now, early March is when we start getting hundreds of baby birds. Usually, it’s about 200 baby animals in our care at a time. That can also be baby mammals like bunnies and squirrels and raccoons,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Garvais explained that March 1 is the unofficial beginning of baby bird season, when birds including mockingbirds, towheess, sparrows, finches, crows and seagulls begin to hatch from their nests.</p>\n<p>She also emphasized the difference between birds in the hatchling, nestling and fledgling stages of development, as they should each be treated in a different way.</p>\n<p>“Hatchlings are straight out of the egg, within the past couple days. Nestlings have a couple of feathers, but are still mostly naked and are around a week old. Fledglings are fully feathered, and they are almost ready to fly,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>If found on the ground, hatchlings and nestlings should be returned to their nest if possible. However, it is normal for fledglings leave the nest as they mature.</p>\n<p>“They do spend some time on the ground for a little while once they are fully feathered, hopping around and learning how to fly. That’s normal. Their muscles are still developing for a couple of weeks,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to instruct people not to kidnap animals that don’t need to be saved. The best way for any baby to grow up is with their parents, so if you see a baby the first instinct shouldn’t be ‘I need to get this out immediately,’ it should be ‘I need to call for help.’ ”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Baby birds are hatching all over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCSB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UCSB</a>!

As soon as they are snagged, they just break off so the cat can’t get injured,” Garvais said. According to Garvais, cats are the top danger to birds in the area, injuring over 200 birds in the Santa Barbara area each year.</p>\n<p>If a bird seems injured or orphaned, or if the nestling’s nest cannot be found, Garvais encourages students to contact SBWCN’s rescue hotline at (805) 681-1080.</p>\n<p>Once under the care of SBWCN, the rescued animals will receive attentive support until they are ready to be released back into the wild.</p>\n<p>“For hummingbirds, we feed them special nectar that we get from Denmark. It’s specifically the best hummingbird nectar that you can get,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Songbirds are fed a mixture of mealworms, yogurt and vitamins that are blended together like a smoothie. They are fed by volunteers every 20 to 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>Garvais hopes to debunk common misconceptions students may have about treating injured birds.</p>\n<p>“There are all these myths associated with baby birds that if you touch one then its parents won’t be able to recognize it anymore. That is totally false. We don’t recommend that people touch the animals more than they need to be, but in order to renest a baby bird, it can be put back,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Garvais herself first learned about SBWCN when her friends brought an injured duck into her dorm room while she was living in San Miguel Hall. After a quick Google search, she discovered SBWCN and decided to take the duck over.</p>\n<p>“I actually got an Uber and brought the bird to them. It was really cool to know that this resource exists,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Garvais feels that many UCSB and Isla Vista residents don’t know about SBWCN, especially due to the constantly changing population of college students.
