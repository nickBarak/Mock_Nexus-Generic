Irvine (22-6 overall, 18-6 MPSF) enters as the second overall seed in the conference, having ended the regular season with a five-game winning streak.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the two previous meetings between the teams in the regular season, UCI defeated Santa Barbara on both occasions, sweeping the first game at Rob Gym 3-0 and prevailing at home 3-1. However, UCSB has evolved into a completely different team in the two month span since the last time these teams played.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht has turned into the go-to player for the Gauchos, recording double-digit kills in his final seven games of the season and leading the team in kills for much of that span. Having only made one total appearance as a substitute in both games against the Anteaters, Licht will add an extra dimension for UCSB’s offense.</p>\n<p>The game has added meaning for senior middle blocker Dylan Davis. In what quite possibly may be his final game of his collegiate career, Davis, the lone remaining starter from the team that reached the title game two years ago, has guided the team for much of the season and brings proven postseason experience to a relatively young squad.</p>\n<p>The team captain has delivered for the Gauchos throughout the season, posting 1.37 blocks per game and averaging a .438 hitting percentage, ranking third and sixth in the conference, respectively. In the first match against Irvine, Davis was forced to exit from the game early due to injury and could not play in the final crucial moments of the match.</p>\n<p>Sweeping five of its last seven opponents, UC Irvine enters the playoffs as the hottest team in the country and ready to repeat as champions. With the best middle blocker tandem in the league, juniors Scott Kevorken and Collin Mehring, Irvine is second in the MPSF in opponent hitting percentage (.238). Kevorken and Mehring come in with a .506 and .484 hitting percentage, respectively.</p>\n<p>If that was not enough to contain for the Gauchos, they will also have to account for AVCA National Player of the Year, junior outside hitter Kevin Tillie. This year, the Frenchman has averaged 3.83 kills per set and had a total of 32 kills in seven total sets against the Gauchos this season.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

The junior is second in the league in both kills per set and total kills, averaging 3.96 per set and recording 313 overall.</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Aggies’ senior middle blocker Katie Quinn also finds herself on the division leaderboard, ranking third in blocks per set with an average of 1.20.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, sophomore middle blocker Phoebe Grunt continues to be a division leader in hitting percentage, converting .333 of her attempts. Spindt also continues to lead to league in digs per set, averaging 4.51.</p>\n<p>“I think we will be more prepared this time for Davis, we’ve had a few hard fought matches since then,” junior outside hitter Ali Barbeau said. “I think we’re more prepared to tough it out, and stay in and be aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Bringing up the rear of the league this season are the Aggies, who currently hold the last place spot.</p>\n<p>Though it has not seemed to translate into wins, the Highlanders are currently shooting for 2,715 total attempts so far this season, putting them in the middle of the pack at fifth in the division.</p>\n<p>“So much about this time of year is just executing the game plan and being consistent, and I think we’ll be able to handle that,” Lantagne Welch said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play Davis Friday and UCR on Saturday. Both games start at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of October 30, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

winning 18-11 season and a NCAA tournament appearance in 2013, the UCSB women’s volleyball team is looking to live up to expectations as it goes into the 2014 season ranked third in the Big West preseason poll.</p>\n<p>Though the team lost key starters in opposite Katey Thompson and UCSB’s all-time digs leader outside hitter/libero Leah Sully, it also gained six new freshmen to the roster

Walthal, in addition to existing assistant coach Kolby O’Donnell.</p>\n<p>Placing first in the Big West last season counts six titles for the team and 28 total appearances in the NCAA tournament for UCSB. Returning starters for the Gauchos this year include outside hitters sophomore Ali Spindt and junior Ali Barbeau, as well as sophomore middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Allie Sullberg.</p>\n<p>Last season, both Spindt and Barbeau made the All-Big West First Team, and Grunt was named an All-Big West Honorable Mention. Spindt was also named Big West Freshman of the Year. In addition, Grunt placed first in blocks in the Big West with an average of 1.28 blocks per set, followed by Sullberg who placed fourth with an average of 1.14 blocks per set.</p>\n<p>Losing Sully will be a hit to the team’s strength and versatility as her true position as an outside hitter was sidelined to fill the role as the team’s starting libero. Searching to fill the gap left by Sully, UCSB has recruited three liberos: freshmen Sydney Bast, Kelly Bielaski and Jane Lamp.</p>\n<p>Other incoming freshmen this year are outside hitter Chanel Hoffman, middle blocker/opposite Megan Sullivan and setter/outside hitter Noa Nightingale.</p>\n<p>The four remaining seniors on this year’s squad are setter Ali Santi, libero Keely Stevenson, outside hitter Jordan Pehanick and middle blocker Elizabeth Meddaugh. Last year Santi ranked second on the team in sets with 399 overall.</p>\n<p>As for the rest of the team, redshirt junior setter Hanna Nielson is returning this season after ranking seventh in the Big West and first on the team in assists with 719 overall, and an average of 6.6 assists per set. Junior opposite Jaylen Villanueva will also be returning this season after reaching a career-high of 102 kills last season.</p>\n<p>In the Big West Preseason poll, the Gauchos came in behind Hawai’i and Long Beach State and one spot ahead of long time powerhouse Cal State Northridge. The first Big West conference game for the Gauchos will be at home in the Thunderdome against rival Cal Poly on Saturday, Sept. 27. at 7:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55980\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/ucsb-attempts-to-repeat-as-big-west-champs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55980\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/ucsb-attempts-to-repeat-as-big-west-champs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/ucsb-attempts-to-repeat-as-big-west-champs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/ucsb-attempts-to-repeat-as-big-west-champs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/ucsb-attempts-to-repeat-as-big-west-champs/","id":5298,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[5297,5296,5295],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stepping Up When it Matters Most","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-11.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"If you thought the only underdogs winning in college were in basketball, think again.

The UCSB men’s volleyball team is entering the playoffs on a streak very reminiscent of when it went on its Cinderella run two years ago all the way to the NCAA title match.</p>\n<p>After starting the season 5-11 and ranking as low as last place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, the Gauchos finished the regular season winning 10 of their last 14 games and are in perfect position to make some noise, just like they did two seasons ago.</p>\n<p>In a rollercoaster season with ups and downs throughout, the one constant for UCSB has been the leadership of senior middle blocker and team captain Dylan Davis. The lone remaining starter of the team that finished as the national runner-up two seasons ago, Davis has led the team not just with his excellent play, but also with his experience that has propelled UCSB into becoming a serious contender.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“With some of the young guys we have on the team, it’s not about me being a hyper-aggressive captain or anything like that,” Davis said. “The best way I can be captain and leader on this team is by playing my best every night and making sure the other guys can have an even mind when we’re playing teams.”</p>\n<p>Davis let his playing do much of the talking this year, finishing the season with 210 kills and ranking first on the team in hitting percentage (.438) and blocks (151). His 437 total blocks throughout his career ranks third all-time in program history. However, what you don’t see is Davis’ significance to the young team inside the locker room.</p>\n<p>“He’s been a great leader; he’s our captain and he’s gotten these guys to push every day in practice and really set their goals, and really work towards them,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “That wasn’t an easy thing to do when we were 3-9 in league and he kept going and kept to the task, and now we’re [11-13] in league and we’re in the playoffs.”</p>\n<p>As a sophomore, Davis was thrust onto volleyball’s biggest stage with six seniors starting alongside him and despite losing in the title game against Ohio State, that experience has been invaluable in shaping Davis’ role as team captain this year.</p>\n<p>“Being one of the only guys left on the team that was able to experience [the NCAA Final Four], I realize that I have to bring a kind of leadership to this team and just be the most complete player I possibly can,” Davis said. “And just allow the other players to build off of it [and] gain their own confidence … That’s pretty much been my own goal.”</p>\n<p>Sneaking into the MPSF playoffs as a No. 7 seed in 2011, the Gauchos went on an improbable run, defeating the No. 2, No. 6 and top overall seed USC en route to capturing the conference title and ultimately losing the national title game in five sets. Yet, perhaps no game in that incredible run was more significant to Davis than the national semifinal rematch versus USC.</p>\n<p>On the game’s biggest stage, Davis picked the right occasion for his coming-out party. In the match, Davis recorded 15 kills and a NCAA tournament record .882 hitting percentage, leading his team to the championship game and marking the beginning of Davis’ transition to being the leader he is now for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“It gave me confidence in that I could compete with anybody on the other side,” Davis said. “I knew that the way I played was going to be the way I dictated my season and that game — having one of the best games of my career, really taught me I can hang with whomever.”</p>\n<p>Despite losing back in 2011, Davis has used the loss to fuel him to get his current team to where he wants them to be as they prepare to make their first postseason appearance after missing out last year.</p>\n<p>“I think it gives him the desire to get back there and win it,” McLaughlin said. “We had a tough loss back there two years ago and I think that just makes Dylan even hungrier to get this team on the same page so we can get back there and win it.”</p>\n<p>Entering the season with a roster consisting of only three seniors, Davis had the responsibility of leading a very young team through the toughest conference in collegiate volleyball. Yet, the team has responded to Davis’ style of leadership and he has embraced his role of team captain and all the pressures that come along with it.</p>\n<p>“There are guys that look up to you. You have to always be ready to play. You can’t have an off day. You’re going to be the guy that everyone looks up to in the end,” Davis said. “It’s just one of those situations where you have to be confident and be sure of yourself that you’re going to handle that pressure of people expecting so much of you.”</p>\n<p>Now a senior and playing in his final opportunity to win a national championship, Davis understands the potential this team has developed over the course of the season and is confident his team can make a run like they did when he was just a sophomore.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is starting to click and it couldn’t have come at a better time right now,” Davis said. “I have high hopes for the end of the season and we just got to keep it going … I don’t want it to stop; I don’t want the end to come soon.”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB will have to play on the road in the first round of the playoffs against UC Irvine on Saturday, the Gauchos still have a little magic on their side in Davis, and we all know what happened last time he entered the playoffs as an underdog.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Daniel Wade of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50882\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50882\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/","id":5299,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5298,5297,5296],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
