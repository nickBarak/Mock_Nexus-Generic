This Halloween weekend, there will be approximately 200 officers from both the UC Police Department and Santa Barbara Sherriff’s Department stationed in I.V. Student organizations such as Take Back the Night (TBTM), the Associated Students (A.S.) Commission on Public Safety and the A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) office have planned multiple events this weekend to give students options to safely celebrate Halloween.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said A.S. will host Pardall Center Chill Space from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday on the first floor of the Pardall Center, open to anyone in I.V. over Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>“My main goal is only to provide local, safe and educational events during Halloween,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>TBTN Co-Chair and third-year political science major Gema Hernández Nava said TBTN will host an additional student event from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday on the second floor of the Pardall Center, called Pardall Center Safe Space. Hernández Nava said advocates from Campus Advocacy and Resources Education (C.A.R.E.) and the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center will be on site to assist students who experience harassment during the Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>“We know it can get a little hectic when people get more drunk and when it gets later,” Hernández Nava said. “It’s called a safe space so that people can come and chill if they need a place. They can talk to an advocate if they’ve experienced something dramatic or because they didn’t know what to do in a situation.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said her office will also be hosting Haunt the Loop from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday in the I.V. business area, a trick-or-treat event for Isla Vista residents to go visit I.V. businesses and receive gifts and candy.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to shift culture and get families to come and actually trick-or-treat here,” Dela Cruz said. “They can actually enjoy Halloween. It’s not just drunk students partying.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Commission on Public Safety Chair and second-year political science and global studies double-major Dwayne Mosbey said student organizations are working alongside police officers to implement the University of California Isla Vista Volunteering Program (UCIV) — a public volunteer program that mediates between police officers and I.V. partygoers. According to Mosbey, UCIV volunteers will be distributing water, escorting residents to their homes and warning residents of the noise ordinance, which restricts residents from playing loud music past 6 p.m., to prevent citations.</p>\n<p>“[UCIV] is something very simple that we at UCSB can do just to ensure that people in our community, as well as the people coming in, are safe,” Mosbey said. “Even though, in a way, it is a little bit of a reactive measure, it drastically reduces the incidents that are going to be happening that night.”</p>\n<p>According to Mosbey, volunteers and partygoers alike have praised UCIV in the past, and it will likely be a permanent facet for future Halloween and Deltopia weekends.</p>\n<p>“So far, students have loved it. [Volunteers] have a chance to interact with the community and they get volunteer hours for doing something they would have loved to do anyways,” Mosbey said. “It’s looking like it will be a permanent thing for UCSB to have.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming said the Isla Vista party scene is largely “uni-dimensional” and does not provide enough options for the university’s diverse and “sophisticated” student population. Fleming said student organizations are hosting alternative events to accommodate the wide interests of UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“Every student doesn’t just want to walk up and down the street or party. Some of our students would really like to have music, entertainment and other things to do,” Fleming said. “I think this is really about giving students options so that there isn’t just this one-size-fits-all attitude or campus environment.”<br>\nFleming said she hopes student organizations will begin hosting alternative events to I.V.’s party scene every weekend, rather than just during Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see us have a vibrant weekend music scene that would be happening on campus that would give students an alternative to underage drinking in I.V. or the kind of party scene that can be riskier,” Fleming said. “I actually think that what I’m seeing is that students want that, and I’m hoping we can have a partnership around that.”</p>\n<p>A version of

id=\"caption-attachment-66014\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Del Playa Drive was surprisingly quiet this Halloween weekend, with festivities drawing significantly smaller crowds and resulting in fewer misdemeanor arrests and medical evacuations compared to previous years.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), crowds on the streets in I.V. numbered approximately 500 people, largely UCSB students and other local residents, compared to several thousand in 2014 and 12,000 to 15,000 in 2013, a large portion of which were out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>SBSO reports an estimated 28 misdemeanor arrests were made on Friday and Saturday compared to the 40 made in 2014 and 200 over a three-day period in 2013. There were seven medical transports, also significantly lower than in previous years, according to the SBSO.</p>\n<p>SBSO attributed the quiet weekend to alternative, campus-based events, which drew crowds away from house parties and limited Halloween festivities to UCSB students. The Associated Students Program Board drew many students off the streets of I.V. and into the Thunderdome with musical performances by Fitz and the Tantrums on Friday and Snoop Dogg on Saturday.</p>\n<p>SBSO Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said the Sherriff’s Office “credits the students” for the decrease in visitors from out of town coming to I.V. to celebrate Halloween.</p>\n<p>“[The] community has been through a lot, and the students no longer wanted to risk inviting out-of-towners,” Hoover said. “We believe the students have a lot of pride in our community and had a huge hand in keeping the event local.”</p>\n<p>Hoover also said student organizations like UCIV working alongside law enforcement contributed to the relative quietness of Halloween this year.</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing like students helping enforce the rules, and they were passing out safety tips and passing out water,” Hoover said. “They were reminding students to move their cars and keep in accordance with the ordinance. It was really great working with students this weekend.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair and second-year global studies and political science double-major Dwayne Mosbey said the relationship between students and police officers was more positive than in previous years.</p>\n<p>“You could walk down the street and see officers playing Frisbee with some of the people walking about,” Mosbey said. “There was a record low number of [citations] handed out this year.”</p>\n<p>Mosbey also said the two concerts hosted by A.S. Program Board were “incredibly effective” at preventing crowds in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The only time I saw traffic while walking I.V. was students going to the concerts,” Mosbey said. “I applaud and am so appreciative of Program Board for putting on such a great program this year with artists that the students just really wanted to hear.”</p>\n<p>Mosbey also said the UCIV efforts received “incredibly positive feedback” throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>“Even when our volunteers went to warn people about the noise ordinance, their warnings were received in a very positive manner and they really appreciated what we were doing,” Mosbey said.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said organizations like UCIV help “shift the culture” in I.V. toward community policing.</p>\n<p>“These students were giving out warnings about noise ordinances and citations,” Dela Cruz said. “I’m just really glad to have seen Isla Vista safe and local.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said community events like Haunt-a-Loop, which invited local children to trick-or-treat on Pardall Road Saturday afternoon and early evening, were “really successful” in making Halloween weekend a more positive and community-based event.</p>\n<p>“That event to me signified a shift in culture — of students taking a stance and saying we want to make sure that the families and the children in our community know that they can also trick-or-treat in Isla Vista, that it’s not just a place where students are just going to get drunk,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said I.V. businesses helped collaborate with A.S. to promote a safe Halloween by providing T-shirts and giveaway items for a Scavenger Hunt.</p>\n<p>“Our local businesses came together and gave us free stuff and helped us enjoy ourselves,” Dela Cruz said. “It was a collaborative effort and students enjoyed it.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Andrea Cisneros said over the past few years the police presence has changed the Halloween culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The Halloween from my first year was very different from this year,” Cisneros said. “My first year, Halloween was a big deal. There were still some of the same regulations — like in the residence halls we weren’t allowed to have visitors — but there weren’t that many police.”</p>\n<p>Cisneros said the alternative events UCSB planned were effective in deterring students from partying on Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>“Having Snoop Dogg and filling the Thunderdome on the weekend was a great success,” Cisneros said. “I think people took initiative to plan alternative events because they understand that not everyone wants to party this weekend, which was really nice.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Lydia Gil said the alternative, student-only events helped decrease the crowds in I.V. and kept out-of-towners from visiting I.V. over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“They helped discourage the idea that it gets super crowded here during Halloween because most people were busy with the activities,” Gil said in an email. “I think this will also discourage more people from coming next year.”</p>\n<p>Gil said this year the Halloween celebration in I.V. was safer and more enjoyable than years past.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was better because there were more options, like having two concerts and the roller skating at the Rec. Cen.,” Gil said in an email. “Also, there wasn’t too many people walking the streets, so it wasn’t that crazy.”</p>\n<p>First-year biopsychology major John Nguyen said although the police presence in I.V. over the weekend was alarming at first, he felt safer throughout the weekend with a visible law enforcement present.</p>\n<p>“I think students were shocked by the amount of police presence,” Nguyen said. “But I think the ultimate consensus was that the police presence made us feel safer.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-02/halloween-events-police-presence-draw-crowds-away-from-dp/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-02/halloween-events-police-presence-draw-crowds-away-from-dp/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-02/halloween-events-police-presence-draw-crowds-away-from-dp/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-02/halloween-events-police-presence-draw-crowds-away-from-dp/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-02/halloween-events-police-presence-draw-crowds-away-from-dp/","id":4615,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[4614,4613,4612],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Officials, A.

Public Safety Commission have been coordinating with emergency response teams and local public health organizations to prepare for the upcoming El Niño, expected to hit Southern California this winter.</p>\n<p>El Niño is a weather anomaly characterized by higher-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, causing an increase in rainfall over the Eastern Pacific area. Isla Vista residents are advised to have an emergency supply kit, know the location of their electrical breaker and coordinate with landlords on gutter maintenance.</p>\n<p>According to Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services Marc Fisher, UC Santa Barbara is preparing for El Niño by preparing emergency supplies, building sandbag barriers, testing emergency generators and repairing gutters and storm drains. Fisher said he hopes El Niño will be mild, but administration is preparing the campus for heavy rains and winds.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We are hoping for the best, but planning for the worst,” Fisher said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Fisher, past El Niño weather has made campus roads and local freeways inaccessible.</p>\n<p>“In 2005, the La Conchita landslide occurred at the end of a 15-day period of record rain shutting down Highway 101,” Fisher said in an email.<br>\nFisher said the administration and A.S.

Bikes to improve bike path conditions.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said the university predicts project completion dates will be delayed.</p>\n<p>“Presently we are focused on activities such as completing foundations, installing all-weather traffic surfaces on construction sites, applying waterproofing to structures where possible and ensuring that water runoff from rains is filtered and controlled,” Fisher said in an email.</p>\n<p>Public Safety Commission I.V. liaison and fourth-year history and political science double-major Duncan Calvert said the commission has been working with administration and emergency response teams to inform I.V. about recommended precautions.</p>\n<p>“What we’ve been doing is reaching out to [Campus Emergency Manager] James Caesar, Marc Fisher, both the fire departments and talking about how we can best take their expertise and take their message and be the liaisons to the students because we have the communication channels for that,” Calvert said.</p>\n<p>Calvert said because El Niño is unpredictable and irregular, the commission is preparing for conditions more severe than past averages.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking at this year as having above average rainfalls, above average thunderstorms, wet weather, and with that in mind, we’re doing our best to prepare,” Calvert said.</p>\n<p>According to Calvert, the Commission has been studying California’s response to the 1998 El Niño.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been researching the ’98 event because that’s the closest parallel and seeing what went right there and what went wrong and trying to basically improve on that and take some lessons from that,” Calvert said.</p>\n<p>Calvert said while the current drought has created soil conditions prone to flooding and mudslides during wet weather, the university and most areas of I.V. are not in flash flood zones.</p>\n<p>“The nice thing is that Isla Vista and campus, basically to an extremely large extent, aren’t in flash flood areas,” Calvert said. “There’s one area north of FT that is in some type of a flood zone, but that’s about it. What we’re more worried about is storm drains clogging up and that causing flooding.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Hannah Lian said she purchased renter’s insurance in preparation for potential weather damage.</p>\n<p>“I was studying pretty late for a midterm and got notifications on my phone about a flash flood, and when I got home I found that there was an inch of water over the floor of our house,” Lian said. “I got renters insurance so it would be covered if it flooded again this year.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Lindsay Apperson said she is concerned with how potential cliff erosion will affect structures on Del Playa.</p>\n<p>“I am worried about the cliffs,” Apperson said. “I live on DP so I’m hoping we don’t get evacuated.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 11 of the Thursday, October 29 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65933\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/ucsb-officials-a-s-to-begin-preparations-for-approaching-el-nino/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65933\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/ucsb-officials-a-s-to-begin-preparations-for-approaching-el-nino/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/ucsb-officials-a-s-to-begin-preparations-for-approaching-el-nino/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/ucsb-officials-a-s-to-begin-preparations-for-approaching-el-nino/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/ucsb-officials-a-s-to-begin-preparations-for-approaching-el-nino/","id":4616,"author":{"id":251,"name":"Naomi Stolpner"},"related":[4615,4614,4613],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic Building to discuss what public safety services an I.V. Community Service District (CSD) could provide if created in the November 2016 county election.</p>\n<p>Discussion focused on Halloween and options for local law enforcement under a CSD. Tuesday’s meeting was the third in a series of 11 weekly meetings the Initiative has organized for I.V. stakeholders to discuss the specific framework of an I.V. CSD. As stipulated in Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3, an I.V. CSD would have the ability to contract additional law enforcement from the County of Santa Barbara, and the University of California could supplement current law enforcement.</p>\n<p>This Halloween weekend, I.V. Foot Patrol and the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) used the same tactics as in past Halloween and Deltopia events, focusing on increased law enforcement, medics, first aid, fire and search and rescue, according to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino.</p>\n<p>Plastino said most of these services were used minimally or not at all due to small crowds, and said the same amount of resources may not be necessary for future Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>“As things mellow out in Isla Vista, we can continue to reduce our presence during major events like that because they’re not so major any longer,” Plastino said. “There certainly isn’t a threat to the public, so you can scale back law enforcement when that occurs.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he was worried about the large police presence intimidating some people, but the overall response from I.V. residents was positive.</p>\n<p>“I was concerned that up-staffing of law enforcement might be negative to some people,” Plastino said. “I was very mindful of that, but that wasn’t what we heard out on the street. It was a good feeling.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Police Department Lieutenant Mark Signa said law enforcement was “toned down” this year and campus events such as Delirium helped to make this year safer than past Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>“All these things came together,” Signa said.  “Our biggest issue of the weekend was trying to get students into the concert. You really couldn’t ask for a better problem than that.”</p>\n<p>Signa said the UCIV, a program coordinating volunteers to mediate between law enforcement and I.V. partygoers, was successful during Halloween weekend and should operate more often.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’ll be into further talks about extending UCIV into a yearlong program that’s not for just major events,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa said although he supports the program, he is concerned about a partnership with UCIV and the local law enforcement creating a “stigma” against UCIV volunteers.</p>\n<p>“My major issue with being too involved with law enforcement in the program is attaching that vibe to it — and then you start losing some of the effectiveness with students,” Signa said. “I want us to be involved as much as possible in the training and the encouragement and support, but at the same time still have that independence.”</p>\n<p>According to vice president of the I.V. Downtown Business Association Jay Freeman, the lack of visitors on Halloween hurt local businesses by detracting from their usual crowds.</p>\n<p>“There needs to be some way of thinking about the problem of the events in the area that’s not ‘let’s just totally shut down the existence of events,’” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said some I.V. residents are interested in a sobering center where I.V. partygoers can go as an alternative to jail. The center would include an alcohol and drug education program.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and third year public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said I.V. Alcohol and Other Drug Council is currently working to create a sobering center.</p>\n<p>“The main thing we are trying to find is funding for it,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Field organizer for Williams’ Office Cameron Schunk said encouraging some visitors to come to I.V. every weekend, instead of attracting large crowds on Halloween and Deltopia, would help businesses without negatively affecting the community.</p>\n<p>“I’m looking at a model where every weekend is an opportunity where we set up things that will attract visitors and we have structure in place to handle those visitors,” Schunk said. “So it’s not we just get hit every once in a while with a big rush of people — it’s every weekend we expect visitors — we want them because they’re going to bring revenue.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-safety-services/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-safety-services/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-safety-services/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-safety-services/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/i-v-community-meeting-discusses-safety-services/","id":4617,"author":{"id":251,"name":"Naomi Stolpner"},"related":[4616,4615,4614],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
