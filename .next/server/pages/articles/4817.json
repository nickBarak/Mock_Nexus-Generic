The three losses for the Huskies drop them to 9-9 on the season. They have dropped five of their last six games.</p>\n<p>Before Sunday’s match began, UCSB knew it had a great opportunity to pick up its third sweep of an opponent this season as well as pick up its sixth straight victory. Because of this, it did not waste any time in putting away its opponent.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Senior infielder Connor Buckley started the scoring for his Huskies after hitting an RBI-groundout to take a 1-0 lead in the top of the second. The Gauchos quickly responded in the bottom of the inning after redshirt sophomore Josh Adams hit a two-run homer to take a 2-1 lead after two innings.</p>\n<p>UCSB added another run in the third thanks to redshirt sophomore JJ Muno’s third home run of the season and would also add one in the fourth to take a 4-1 lead.</p>\n<p>In the fifth inning Santa Barbara again was able to shut down the Huskies offense while adding more runs to its lead. Both runs scored in the inning were due to errors made by the visiting team which gave the Gauchos a 6-1 lead after five innings.</p>\n<p>The Huskies would add one more run in the seventh inning, however, they could not muster enough hits to make a comeback which lead to their eventual 6-2 loss.</p>\n<p>Gaucho pitcher Joe Record picked up his third win of the season after a solid seven-inning performance. The redshirt sophomore allowed six hits and two runs while also striking out five batters.</p>\n<p>Before having the opportunity to clinch a series sweep, UCSB first had to make a comeback if it wanted to seal a victory over UConn.</p>\n<p>Senior first baseman and captain Bobby Melley, who had a great game going 3-5 with three RBI and one homer, started the scoring for the Huskies after an RBI-single. However, they could not hold on to their lead because of errors. The Gauchos would capitalize scoring one in the third and one in the fourth to take a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>After adding one run in the sixth to tie the game at two, UConn exploded for three runs in the top of the seventh to take a 5-2 lead. Sophomore third baseman Willy Yahn ignited the scoring after a sac fly RBI and Melly hit a two run homer to help extend the lead even further.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos responded by scoring three runs on their own in the bottom of the seventh to tie the game up, courtesy of redshirt junior Andrew Calica’s RBI single, redshirt sophomore catcher Grover Dempsey’s RBI single and freshman outfielder Michael McAdoo’s RBI-double.</p>\n<p>Uconn would regain the lead one more time thanks to Buckley’s RBI single in the top of the eighth, however, UCSB was to much as it added four more runs in the bottom of the inning and won the game 9-6.</p>\n<p>McAdoo had a great game going 3-5 with three RBI and two runs scored. He has been showing flashes as of late and has been a breakout player garnering solid playing time as a freshman. Fisher also had a solid game going 2-3 on the evening with three runs scored.</p>\n<p>Before Saturday’s win, Friday’s match-up between Uconn and UCSB was the first time these two teams met in school history and it did not disappoint as the game went down to the wire with a walk-off three-run homer by sophomore DH Austin Bush that sealed the deal for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The scoring began early for Santa Barbara as it drew first blood in the first inning after a McAdoo sac fly RBI that brought in Calica. UConn tied the game in the third inning at one after senior Jack Sundberg batted in a runner with a groundout down the right field line.</p>\n<p>Bush helped his team regain the lead in the bottom of the seventh after a solid RBI-single. However, in the top of the eighth an error by the Gauchos gave UConn a run and tied the game at two.</p>\n<p>The ninth inning the real drama unfolded as junior DH Tyler Gnesda hit his third home run of the season to give his team a 3-2 lead heading into the bottom of the ninth. Down to three outs, the Gauchos showed they were not fazed by the pressure and that they were resiliant.</p>\n<p>Calica started the inning strong with a double down the left field line followed by Dempsey reaching first base on a fielder’s choice and sending Calica to third. With no outs UCSB already had the tying run in scoring position and a go-ahead runner on base.</p>\n<p>After an Adams strikeout, the Gauchos knew they still had two outs to get the tying run home or even win the game right there. The next batter was Bush, who has already had a fantastic season thus far. The sophomore added a game-winning walk-off home run to his fantastic season as his three-run shot ended the game 5-3 in favor of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Another great weekend for Santa Barbara has to have them feeling well about its start to the season. Not only has it had great offensive fireworks, but it seems as though the pitching staff is starting to improve as well.</p>\n<p>Many new faces have stepped up and has really impressed not only the coaching staff but the fans as well. Not many people predicted a 15-3 start for this young team, but that is why you play the games.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is going to be away from home Tuesday, March 22 against Cal State Bakersfield at Hardt Field  at 6 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Food Co-Op.</p>\n<p>I.V. is currently the largest unincorporated community under the direct governmental supervision of Santa Barbara County, and plans for its self-governance have been in the works throughout this past year, especially in light of past violent events such as Deltopia and the May 23 shootings. Among the different options on the table for potential forms of self-governance for I.V. — including the establishment of a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/self-governance-in-isla-vista-an-uncertain-future/\">Community Services District (CSD)</a>, the establishment of a Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) and cityhood — Abboud, Schunk and other self-governance advocates support establishing I.V. as a form of CSD.</p>\n<p>Initially presented to A.S. and county officials by recent graduate Josh Plotke, a CSD would absorb the I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVPRD) — currently the only governing body within I.V. — as well as County Service Area No. 31 and provide a number of services funded through a utility users tax.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Coalition member and comparative literature graduate student Shari Sanders, many residents believe they do not have a voice in decisions made for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The number one thing people are saying is that they don’t have access to the decisions that are made in Isla Vista that are affecting them directly,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p>According to Sanders, this disconnect stems from a lack of adequate representation for I.V. at the county level.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have our own kind of officials that are enfolded inside the county,” Sanders said. “We have an enormously difficult time holding anybody accountable for things that they say they will do for us.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine if we had the ability to install our own improved bluff fencing … The discussions about the fence could also occur in Isla Vista, instead of miles away at 9 a.m. on a Wednesday in a sterile county office building. — Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said April’s Deltopia riots exemplify the difficulties faced by I.V. when there is little student-to-county communication on how to deal with large, potentially dangerous events.</p>\n<p>“Students were tear gassed and civil unrest broke out on Deltopia because there was no cohesive plan with how to deal with the event,” Schunk said. “There was no cooperation from the county, largely.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, having an autonomous governmental entity in I.V. based off of a CSD will allow I.V. residents to leverage more power in the community via tax dollars spent on local projects.</p>\n<p>“We wouldn’t be waiting in line, or trying to entice the county to play favorites and spend money on us,” Schunk said. “We’d be able to spend the tax dollars on ourselves, on projects that were agreed upon at the local level.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58247\" style=\"width: 413px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"135838197\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58241\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58247\" data-attachment-id=\"58247\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/town-hall-meeting-st-marks-parish_kenneth-song_10-09-1024x680/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,680\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412710004\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"90\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024×680\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58247\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Town-Hall-Meeting-@-St-Marks-Parish_Kenneth-Song_10.09-1024x680.jpg?resize=403%2C268\" alt=\"Community members presented options such as a Municipal Advisory Council, Community Services District and cityhood.

It’s like a one-size-fits-all,” Abboud said. “That size doesn’t fit Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>That being said, I.V. self-governance advocates such as Abboud and Schunk are pushing for a CSD “custom made” for I.V.</p>\n<p>“We want take some of the ideas of the CSD law and then write a new law that’s specially catered to Isla Vista’s needs,” Abboud said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re writing a skeleton version of the bill, and then we’re going to give that to them for the staff in the capitol to actually write it.  — Jonathan Abboud</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk and Abboud said they have been working on drafting the “new law” with the intent of having it introduced into the California state legislature this December by Assemblyman Das Williams and State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson.</p>\n<p>“We’ve met with them a lot about introducing the legislation and they’re both supportive,” Abboud said. “We’re writing a skeleton version of the bill, and then we’re going to give that to them for the staff in the capitol to actually write it.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said that if the would-be bill is enacted into state law, the next step will be to apply through the county to have a measure passed that calls for the establishment of a special district on the ballot in the next county-wide election.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58245\" style=\"width: 424px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"588370579\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58241\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58245\" data-attachment-id=\"58245\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/iv_photos_johnclow_11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=3000%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1358266877\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"IV_Photos_JohnClow_11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58245\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11-1024x682.jpg?resize=414%2C276\" alt=\"Schunk and Abboud hope to eventually see a measure passed that calls for the establishment of a special district on the ballot in the next county-wide election.

All these things require rule changes.  — Jay Freeman</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Hutchins, the CNIV proposes a local government that involves an “inclusive democracy,” governed by a body that would be called “Isla Vista New Community Alliance.” The governing representatives would be elected by residents and five major groups: property owners, business owners, special service districts, the County of Santa Barbara and UCSB and SBCC administrations, faculty and students. But according to Hutchins, his ideas for self-governance have been mostly ruled out by much of the I.V. population.</p>\n<p>“So far, it appears that [the CNIV] has been missed by student and community activists,” Hutchins said, “and our point-of-view dismissed without thoughtful engagement or consideration.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said the disconnect between the CNIV and the rest of the community may stem from their preference for an advisory group to “provide perspective based on their efforts decades ago.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen CNIV move forward with ideas after receiving very little input from community members. They seek to dictate the terms of self-governance themselves,” Schunk said. “We need the involvement of every single group.”</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident, local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-07-23/i-v-community-discusses-self-governance/\">complete cityhood</a> for I.V. would be the best option for self-governance. According to Freeman, addressing issues such as renting, leasing and property owner accountability “can only be fixed if we have the ability to change the rules and change the laws that we operate under.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you were to go out there and ask people in Isla Vista about self-governance, two-thirds of them don’t know what that means. — Shari Sanders</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The issues that I see with the Community Service District and the Municipal Advisory Council are that the Community Service District is not allowed to change the rules about how this area works,” Freeman said. “All these things require rule changes.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman’s<a href=\"http://www.ivisacity.org/\"> webpage</a>, the services proposed under a CSD and its method of self-governance by levying taxes do not provide a completely sustainable model for the currently “unsustainable” I.V.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58244\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a

discussion.” <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“At this point, the primary concerns people have about Isla Vista becoming a real city are only whether it can sustain its own budget,” Freeman stated. “However, its current situation (where it is essentially subsidized by the rest of the county) is simply unsustainable: Isla Vista needs to either figure out ways to decrease its cost or increase its revenue.”</p>\n<p>Self-governance preferences set aside, Sanders said that one of the largest challenges the movement toward self-governance faces is that a majority of the I.V. community is unaware of the implications of self-governance or the existence of self-governance efforts.</p>\n<p>“If you were to go out there and ask people in Isla Vista about self-governance, two-thirds of them don’t know what that means,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, these issues are something that future conversations will hopefully resolve.</p>\n<p>“There are a couple primary things that I think we have to keep in mind as we work to include the folks in the conversation who are traditionally not present,” Schunk said. “The biweekly community conversations Jonathan [Abboud] and I are hosting provide an opportunity for community-driven discussion.”</p>\n<p>[<strong>Correction: </strong>A previous version of this article stated the event “<a

Student Association (GSA) held a public meeting Thursday in the GSA Formal Lounge at the MultiCultural Center to discuss the role graduate students play in improving Isla Vista.\n<p>GSA held the meeting to determine specific ways for graduate students to help improve I.V., discussing the possibility of working with Associated Student’s External Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk and his staff to gain a better understanding of I.V.’s needs in order to see how graduate students can help to meet those needs. During the meeting, GSA representatives also said it is essential the association hold regular monthly meetings concerning issues surrounding I.V. that are open to public input and discussion.</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of Student Affairs Jason Hopkins, a Ph.D. candidate in the sociology department, said the first step to having graduate students become more involved in I.V. involves determining what the I.V. residents want from graduate students through a some form of assessment of I.V. residents’ needs. </p>\n<p>“We need to take concrete action steps to make a lot of our ideas realized,” Hopkins said. “If we are going to do things that are a little bit more involved and impactful, it would be important to know what the students want. There are over three-thousand grad students that want something to do.”</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of Committees and Planning Matt Sayball, a Ph.D. candidate in the philosophy department, said graduate students should help support local small businesses and break certain norms that accompany being a teacher’s assistant, such as refraining from reaching out to I.V. residents. </p>\n<p>“Grad students live like homeless people in Isla Vista,” Sayball said. “It’s a cool place. It’s funky and it’s got freedom of expression to it that people associate to the UC system and California. We need to support that however we can.”</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of External Affairs Yanira Rivas Pineda, a Ph.D. candidate in the department of political science, led the meeting and said her biggest concern is that by taking action the GSA might offend someone or encroach on the lives of I.V. residents. </p>\n<p>“We want to be more present in Isla Vista, but we have to be really careful,” Pineda said. “We can’t treat the residents there as test subjects for our research.”</p>\n<p>According to Shari Sanders, a Ph.D. candidate in the comparative literature department, GSA should take steps to have more of a presence in Isla Vista. </p>\n<p>“We should go to the more meetings and say hey, we’re GSA representatives and we plan to be more active in the community,” Sanders said. </p>\n<p>Hopkins also said he had specific ideas about actions GSA can take to improve Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We need to print bilingual fliers to give to the residents of Isla Vista and try to make parking more accessible by providing parking permits.”</p>\n<p>Hopkins also said he hopes to see specific improvements made to the GSA website to further promote graduate students’ involvement with I.V. by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the year we should see a volunteer corps that publicly announces what different organizations need so graduate students can help provide those services,” Hopkins said. “By the end of the year, I’d like to see the GSA website have a list of these organizations.”</p>\n<p>According to Pineda, GSA should hold more social events increase graduate student presence in I.V. </p>\n<p>“I think a lot of graduate students feel like outsiders,” Pineda said. “We’re isolated. The more you experience I.V., the more you’ll care and want to help out.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article quoted Sanders as saying “We need to print bilingual fliers to give to the residents of Isla Vista and try to make parking more accessible by providing parking permits.” Sanders did not say this. The statement was actually made by Jason Hopkins.
