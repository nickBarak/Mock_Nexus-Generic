The Golden Bears will look to improve upon their 11-1 record.</p>\n<p>However, for UCSB, overcoming its 12-year winning drought vs. Cal will be no easy feat. In what will be the only regular season matchup between the two programs this year, the anticipation surrounding the Gaucho-Golden Bear showdown has certainly increased after meeting each other a total of four times last season.</p>\n<p>Entering Saturday with an advantage will be Cal as it won each of the four matches.</p>\n<p>Despite already experiencing a loss to the Golden Bears last Saturday, the Gauchos remain confident in their capabilities to overcome their hump but know they must sustain consistency against Cal’s ongoing attack.</p>\n<p>“[Last Saturday it was] 9-8 in the third quarter. [We] gave up a couple of sloppy goals,” Asssitant Coach Ryan McMillen said. “It’s a four quarter game. We had three good quarters, [so] we’re working towards having four solid quarters on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Still, the Gauchos’ potential to upset the Golden Bears remains probable behind the recent play of senior utility Reed Cotterill. A transfer from Golden West College, Cotterill is emerging as one of Santa Barbara’s top players after playing in 28 games, scoring 25 goals and tallying seven assists in his first season at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Cotterill leads the Gauchos in scoring with 15 goals and recently helped Santa Barbara get back on a winning track with a hat trick performance against No. 14 Princeton last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Aiding Cotterill has been the play of junior attacker Shane Hauschild. A Santa Barbara native, Hauschild finds himself second on the team in goals with 14 and is the team’s leader in shots and assists.</p>\n<p>While much time remains on the Gauchos’ schedule to develop as a team, Hauschild understands his role when in the pool and is looking to establish himself more as a team leader.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a new role for me this year,” Hauschild said. “In my first two years I scored a lot because I was the young kid that other teams thought they could leave me and let me try to beat them by myself. This year, me and Reed are getting more of that attention because we’re the older players. [Teams] kind of know who we are are so that’s opening things up for a lot of other guys on our team. I think this year will be a lot more balance scoring wise between everyone as opposed to one or two guys having way more goals than everyone else.”</p>\n<p>As UCSB will hope to establish balance on offense, it will need to ensure it does the same on defense as it prepares to face one of the nation’s best players.</p>\n<p>A pivotal asset within the Golden Bears’ success over the Gauchos all last season and currently having a strong 2016 campaign thus far is sophomore attacker Johnny Hooper.</p>\n<p>Building off an excellent freshman year in which he was crowned the 2015 MPSF Newcomer of the Year, Hooper’s current team-high of 37 goals ranks atop the conference in scoring along with his league-leading 3.08 goals per game.</p>\n<p>While Hooper serves as the Golden Bears primary attacker on offense, Cal possesses an arsenal of scorers that can emerge during any period of the game. Overall, the Golden Bears offense has accumulated a conference-high 192 team goals in 12 games played and lead the MPSF with 16.0 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Even without Hooper included, six other Golden Bears have recorded double-digit goal totals. Following Hooper’s team-high at 15 goals apiece are redshirt freshman Jordan Hoover and true freshman Safak Simsek.</p>\n<p>Set to face one of the most lethal offenses in the nation, it’s inevitable that the Gauchos’ defense will be tested. Cal is one of three teams this season that has reached UCSB’s season-high of 15 goals allowed.</p>\n<p>While no team can truly put the Golden Bears’ offense to a halt, Santa Barbara did return to the drawing board in pursuit of different results come Saturday. But it may take more than a week’s worth of practice for the Gauchos to reach their final form as a team as they have been doing double the work out of the pool.</p>\n<p>“It’s early in the seaosn for us,” McMillen said. “We just got done with our hell month. Most other school weren’t going through that, they were through two hard weeks. We were going eight hours a day for the first four weeks with a day off each week. Now school just started, we’ve done a little bit of a taper and we’re only going about two and a half hours a day.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and Cal’s matchup will begin at noon this Saturday, Oct. 1, at Spieker Aquatics Complex.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of September 29, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy

In that match, Whitelegge had 11 saves to help lead his team to a narrow 6-5 victory in his final home match. Those 11 saves made Whitelegge UCSB’s all-time saves leader with a total of 828.

Both these teams have not fared well against UCSB throughout their respective programs history as UCSD is 18-45 while Occidental has gone winless in nine matches.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the Gauchos went 2-0 against the Tritons. Both matches were close and went down to the wire, including one that was decided in overtime.</p>\n<p>Having not won a game against Santa Barbara in Campus Pool since 2002, UC San Diego will look to junior utility Arman Momdzhyan to break the more than a decade long streak. The transfer leads the team in goals (21) and was named conference player of the week on September 14<sup>th </sup>after registering 14 goals in the Princeton Invitational.</p>\n<p>Not to be forgotten are senior utilities Nick Alexander and Andy Moore. Alexander leads the team in assists while Moore is known as the do-it-all player on his squad.</p>\n<p>UC San Diego certainly has talent, but it might not be enough to rival Santa Barbara’s. Led by Shane Hauschild, the Gauchos are a team that can score double-digits in a short time if their opponent slacks off. Hauschild, a junior attacker, currently leads the team in goals (9) and points (13). He has scored at least two goals in all four matches this year.</p>\n<p>After facing the No. 13 team in the country in what should be a good match, UCSB will turn its attention to Occidental who it has not met since 2005.</p>\n<p>The match against the Tigers could prove to be the classic trap game for the Gauchos. On paper, UCSB should handle Occidental with ease as it has been outscored 88-31 in its six winless matches this season.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara will be playing Occidental immediately following the UC San Diego match. While the visitors will be fresh for the 2 p.m. start time, the home team might be a bit exhausted which is why they might have to count on newcomers to handle the load for the second match.</p>\n<p>Falling under this category is junior attacker Josh Jordan who has had a great start to the season thus far. In 2015, Jordan scored eight goals all season, but this year the California native has stepped up big registering seven goals in four games.</p>\n<p>Playing a double header will be no easy feat for the Gauchos, but it is made easier knowing they will have the roar of their home crowd behind them once again for the new season.</p>\n<p>UCSB is set to play on Saturday, September 17 at Campus Pool against UC San Diego at 12 p.m. and Occidental at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

game of the weekend and UCLA 7-4 the following day. However, the two-time defending champion came short to No. 1 USC in a nerve-wrecking game that came down to the last six seconds of the match ending 8-7 in favor of the Trojans.</p>\n<p>In the opening game on Friday, Stanford came out ready to dominate the competition, nearly shutting out the Gauchos in the first half.</p>\n<p>The first goal came at the 5:19 mark, which initiated a 3-0 run in the first quarter for the Cardinals. The second period started off the same way, with Stanford controlling the tempo of the match allowing it to score another six goals before the end of the first half.</p>\n<p>Midway through the second quarter, UCSB drew the first exclusion of the game. The Gauchos capitalized on the play and junior utility Miranda Schrader found junior attacker Brenna Thomas on the left wing to put Santa Barbara on the board for the first time.</p>\n<p>However, Stanford’s stout defense restricted UCSB to the lone goal, maintaining its eight-point lead going at halftime by a score of 9-1.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game was more favorable for the Gauchos as they seemed more settled and showed glimpses of what got them to the first-round matchup.</p>\n<p>“I think we came down a little bit from the excitement of being here. We found our rhythm and matched their tempo,” Head Coach Serela Kay said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense held off the Cardinals in the third quarter, limiting them to only two goals, both of which came toward the end of the period. Then senior utility Samantha Murphy initiated an offensive breakthrough for the Gauchos, in which they outscored the Cardinals 4-3 in the second half.</p>\n<p>Murphy went 2-3 in the game. Her second goal came in the fourth where she faked out the defense by looking one way and sending the shot to the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The other two goals came courtesy of Schrader with a shot from the right side and junior attacker Jenna Solberg, who got the last goal after she stole it and went for the point herself with only six seconds left on the clock. Solberg picked up a team-high of two steals, while senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw had one along with six saves.</p>\n<p>“We are excited to be playing here at the NCAA Tournament for the first time,” Kay said. “And we know that today was part of the process in getting experience with the bright lights and everything that comes with playing in the ‘Big Dance,’”</p>\n<p>UCSB faced No. 10 UC San Diego the following day in the consolation bracket. Senior attacker Bryn Hudson led the team with two goals and two assists, but it was not enough to take down the Tritons in a 10-5 loss.</p>\n<p>It was Hudson who opened up the scoring for both teams at the 6:47 mark in the first quarter. From the right wing, she shot to the far post where it was impossible for UCSD’s keeper to reach.</p>\n<p>The Tritons answered immediately, scoring their first goal 38 seconds later on a power play. This was the first of six goals that UCSD would make as a result of its 6-on-5 advantages out of the seven they registered.</p>\n<p>After four consecutive plays in which the Tritons scored, the Gauchos were able to break the 4-0 run in the second quarter with a steal from Schrader right in front of the cage. The Gauchos counter-attacked, and a pass from Brokaw to Hudson left the attacker in a one-on-one match against the goalkeeper, completing the play and trimming the score to 4-2.</p>\n<p>Yet again, however, the Tritons reacted with another goal of their own to gain a 5-2 lead at the break.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior center Lauren Martin picked up a goal early in the third period after drawing one of her team-high three ejections in the match to make the score 5-3. Despite an early fourth quarter goal by junior utility Taylor Shore and a last-minute goal by Solberg, the Tritons had managed to score three more before the end of the third period ended and two more in the fourth to secure their victory.</p>\n<p>In the final game of the weekend, UCSB faced the No. 13 San Diego State Aztecs for seventh place, in which the Gauchos finished their 3-0 season sweep of the Aztecs with an 8-2 win.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the nerves that came with being in the Big Dance seemed to finally disappear for the Gauchos in the final match of their season. The defense shut out the Aztecs in three of the four quarters with the help of Brokaw who collected 10 saves and a steal.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the team worked together to tally eight goals in total, six of them coming in the second half. Martin, Shore and junior defender Sophie Trabucco all recorded a pair of goals.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos did not win the tournament, it was a great learning experience for the younger ones who hope to make an appearance again next year and an unforgettable memory for those that are graduating.</p>\n<p>In one season, they broke several records and completed what no other team in program history had accomplished. A major puzzle piece to that success is the Gauchos’ squad of graduating seniors in First Team All-Big West selections Brokaw, Murphy and Martin. Martin was also named to the Second Team All-Tournament.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, next season looks to be just as promising as the Gauchos will welcome back returning players like Thomas, Shore, Schrader, Solberg, Trabucco and the talent from freshmen Ashley Riley and Sarah Kreiser.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
