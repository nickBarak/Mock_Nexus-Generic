This could be due to the fact that the Gauchos are replacing five seniors including star guard Michael Bryson, who was a two-time All Big West First Team selection during his collegiate career.</p>\n<p>Bryson led the team in points per game with 20.1, and fellow seniors forward John Green and center Sam Beeler were third and fourth on the team with 10.8 and 6.7 P.P.G., respectively. Bryson also led the team in rebounds with 6.4 per game.</p>\n<p>Despite that, Santa Barbara has retained two key pieces who will look to be huge factors for the team this season in point guard Eric Childress and shooting guard Gabe Vincent.<br>\nChildress is the only senior on the team this season and has hopes of ending his career well.</p>\n<p>“Nothing much changes for me,” said Childress. “I just want to be a leader for these young guys and help keep them composed during the game. These guys are going to look at me to show them the right way to go.”</p>\n<p>Last year, the 6’0” guard was named a Big West honorable mention after averaging a team-high 4.3 assists per game and leading the team in three-point percent at 45.1 after knocking down a career-high 32 long balls. He was also tied for the first in steals with Vincent at 1.2 per game.</p>\n<p>With that being said, Childress knows he still needs to sharpen his game in some levels in order to be the most effective floor general out there, both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>“You always want to cut down turnovers as a point guard and I definitely want to find some more scoring opportunities,” said Childress. “I want to play the best I can but I don’t want to ruin this team’s chemistry. I just want to fill my role and be a leader.”</p>\n<p>Like his senior teammate, Vincent was also a Big West Honorable Mention after hitting 80 three-pointers last season, second most in school history, and averaging 14.1 points per game, second best on the team.</p>\n<p>“I had a pretty good offseason, worked on my game,” said Vincent. “Every year people expect more and I expect a lot from myself as well. I’m excited to show what I’ve been working on and see how far we can take this team. The goal is to get that ring and go play in the big tournament.”</p>\n<p>The former Big West Freshman of the Year has some big hype surrounding him due to his great shooting ability. Last year he knocked down over 40 percent of his shots, higher than 38 percent from long range, and shot a career high from the line with 80.8. With constant improvement, the Gauchos will expect nothing less this year.</p>\n<p>“Gabe is a great player offensively and can play both ends of the floor,” Williams said. “I expect big things from him; I think he will have a big year.”</p>\n<p>While returning players are always welcomed, ultimately what will carry this Santa Barbara team is the new additions, and none come with more expectations than City College of San Francisco transfer junior Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>During his 2015-2016 campaign at CCSF, the 6’8” forward was named 2016 California State Player of the Year after leading his team to a 32-1 record and a California Community College title while averaging 13.3 points, 9.1 rebounds and 3.4 blocked shots per game.</p>\n<p>“I want to bring rebounding and defending to my team,” Canty said. “For this team to be successful, I’ll be willing to do anything.”</p>\n<p>Returning to the helm for his 19th season, Coach Williams will look to continue to add to the solid legacy he has built at UCSB so far. He is only one of three coaches in Big West history to earn over 300 wins.</p>\n<p>“Love dealing with kids and young men who want to be good and want to get better,” Williams said. “They rejuvenate you. Every year the chance to deal with new fresh kids, and watching their growth.”</p>\n<p>Excited to open the 2016 campaign, the Gauchos will face off against Fresno Pacific in an exhibition match this coming Sunday. Last season, the Sunbirds went 14-13 en route to a disappointing finish in which they were eliminated from postseason contention after losing their senior day matchup.</p>\n<p>Under the helm of a new coach in first-time Head Coach C.J. Haydock, however, Fresno Pacific will look to bounce back and make a statement that this upcoming season will be a better one.</p>\n<p>The Sunbirds are projected to finish 11th in their conference, but they do return two starters from last year’s team, including the team’s second-leading scorer redshirt senior guard Spencer Krannitz, who averaged 14.9 PPG and shot 50.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Although picked to finish fourth in the Big West for the second consecutive season, the Gauchos have the pieces to make a much better run. Besides the two returning guards and Canty, the Gauchos are looking forward to contributions from many other players on the young roster.</p>\n<p>Hopefully Sunday’s exhibition match will be a coming out party for the Santa Barbara team.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s exhibition vs. Fresno Pacific tips off at the Thunderdome on Sunday, Nov. 6 at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

While it hasn’t been the hottest start to the season for Williams and his team, Saturday’s big win could potentially signal a turning point for the Gauchos who currently stand among the middle of the pack with a record of 9-11 overall and 3-4 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After helping UCSB hand the Anteaters their first loss in conference play, Williams expects the skilled play of wing guards Eric Childress and T.J. Taylor to translate over to this week’s match.</p>\n<p>Childress has found his niche as the floor general for UCSB after taking over for former senior and starting point guard Zalmico Harmon. The junior from Hawthorne is among the top guards in the Big West in shooting ability and ball handing, leading the conference in three-point percentage at 51.2 percent and ranking third with an average of 4.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>“The play of Eric has steadily grown throughout the year,” Williams said. “He’s played exceptionally well this last month having one of the best assist-to-turnover ratios on the West coast and shooting from over 50 percent beyond the arc.” [Eric] is really making strides as a player, leader, and helping run the show for us so I’m really proud of him,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>The development of Childress has been evident this year and as of recently he has averaged a total to 10 ppg in the team’s last five contests.</p>\n<p>For Taylor, the senior guard is embracing his role as the sixth man for UCSB. Following a six-game drought without scoring a basket, Williams believes Taylor’s eight point outing on Saturday will open up more opportunities for him as he continues to play quality minutes behind Childress.</p>\n<p>“T.J. hasn’t really had any real opportunities [these past couple of games], but for him to snap out of it and hit a couple big shots was a real spark plug,” Williams said. “He is beloved by this team and to have him step up and contribute was special.”</p>\n<p>It’s been a steady incline for the 5-9” Oakland guard after sitting out the entire 2013-2014 season with a medical redshirt. As his minutes increase, Taylor’s shooting ability will likely draw opponents and leave the floor open for guards Gabe Vincent and Michael Bryson.</p>\n<p>As for first-year Head Coach Eran Ganot and the Warriors, Thursday will also be a defining moment within their conference schedule after having their seven-game winning streak snapped at home by senior guard Nick Faust and the Long Beach State 49ers.</p>\n<p>Hawaii fell to the ‘Beach’ 78-64 last Saturday as Faust erupted for 28 points on 5-8 shooting from downtown. With hopes of bouncing back from the loss, Ganot will likely utilize his deep rotation of guards in Thursday’s matchup by running the team’s offensive sets through All-Big West players Roderick Bobbitt and Aaron Valdes.</p>\n<p>The two guards have been the offensive anchors for the Warriors combining for a total of nine 20-plus point outings this season. The only duo to exceed that this year are UC Riverside’s own Taylor Johns and Jaylen Bland leading the conference with 14 20-plus scoring performances.</p>\n<p>Third year forward Mike Thomas looks to have a strong presence on the road as well finishing with a career-high 20 points in last week’s loss to Long Beach. The junior has been a mismatch against bigs down low using his speedy 6’7” frame to slash by defenders and finish at the rim. Thomas went 7-11 from the field on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins its home stand against Hawaii this Thursday, Feb. 4 at 7 p.m. The Gauchos will also welcome Cal State Fullerton to the Thunderdome on Saturday, Feb. 6 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67888\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-set-to-face-another-big-west-heavyweight-in-hawaii-at-home-this-thursday-host-csuf-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67888\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-set-to-face-another-big-west-heavyweight-in-hawaii-at-home-this-thursday-host-csuf-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-set-to-face-another-big-west-heavyweight-in-hawaii-at-home-this-thursday-host-csuf-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-set-to-face-another-big-west-heavyweight-in-hawaii-at-home-this-thursday-host-csuf-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-set-to-face-another-big-west-heavyweight-in-hawaii-at-home-this-thursday-host-csuf-saturday/","id":367,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[366,365,364],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes a Trip to the Bayou State to Face LSU and La.-Lafayette","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Womens-Basketball-10-1-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Womens-Basketball-10-1-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team hopes to end its six-game losing streak with a road trip to Louisiana to face LSU on Sunday and Louisiana-Lafayette next Tuesday.

After not being on the court since last Thursday, the Ragin’ Cajuns returned to the court on Saturday to earn an 84-36 win versus Dillard University.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB did not have one player average double-figure points per game last season. However, sophomore guard Makala Roper has emerged as the Gauchos’ top scorer this season, averaging 12.4 points per game.</p>\n<p>She has scored within double-figures in five of the team’s nine games, in which four of these scoring performances occurred while she was coming off the bench. Most notably, she scored a career-high 27 points against Pepperdine, prompting her addition to UCSB’s starting lineup. While the free throw line has been troubling for UCSB, Roper leads the Gauchos in free throws made with 31 and is just two three-pointers shy of the team-high of 15 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>LSU is undefeated in home games this season at 3-0. Due to unspecified disciplinary reason, the Tigers lost their leading scorer in former first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection guard Danielle Ballard.</p>\n<p>Still, the Tigers have managed to make up for Ballard’s averages of 14.5 ppg and 7.2 rebounds per game from last season. After starting in just one game and averaging 5.7 ppg last year, sophomore guard Jenna Deemer has embraced a larger role for this year’s LSU team.</p>\n<p>The New Orleans, Louisiana native leads the Tigers in scoring with an average of 11.3 points per game. Nonetheless, she has been LSU’s best deep range shooter. Deemer has made a team-high 20 three-pointers this season and is currently shooting a superb 42.6 percent from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Although junior guard Raigyne Moncrief and transfer forward Alexis Hyder average double-figures in scoring as well at 10 ppg each, it’s their rebounding abilities that makes them most effective on the court. Hyder leads the team in rebounds with 8.2 per game as Moncrief follows behind her at 7.0 per game.</p>\n<p>On average, Santa Barbara is outrebounded in the paint. UCSB averages 34.3 rebounds per game while its opponents have averaged 39.8 rebounds per game this season. Yet, if the Gauchos can be aggressive on the boards and find a way to limit LSU’s second chance points, it may increase their odds in Sunday’s bout.</p>\n<p>Finding a way to gameplan against the Ragin’ Cajuns’ arsenal of guards will be the most challenging aspect in Tuesday’s game for UCSB.  The Gauchos have a chance to end Louisiana-Lafayette’s winning streak in what will be the first meeting between the two programs ever.</p>\n<p>Louisiana-Lafayette has a veteran trio of guards in senior Keke Veal, senior Kia Wilridge and junior Jaylyn Gordon. Each player averages 14 points per game, providing different talents on the court. Wilridge is currently shooting an impressive 53.8 percent from the field while Gordon has been a sharpshooter from behind the three-point line with a 40.4 percentage.</p>\n<p>The Ragin’ Cajuns have held opponents to a measly 27 percent from behind the three-point line so far this season; however, the Gauchos’ ability to knock down their long distance shots may be the best chance they have to combat the level of scoring in Louisiana-Lafayette’s backcourt.</p>\n<p>Along with Roper, freshman shooting guard Coco Miller provides UCSB with the best three-point shooting ability. She holds the team-high of 15 three-pointers made this season and finished 5-10 from behind the perimeter in a 19-point performance versus Santa Clara last Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s game against LSU will tip-off at 1:00 p.m. Pacific time while next Tuesday’s matchup on Dec. 15<sup>th</sup> against Louisiana-Lafayette will begin at 9:00 am Pacific time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66969\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-12/ucsb-takes-a-trip-to-the-bayou-state-to-face-lsu-and-la-lafayette/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66969\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-12/ucsb-takes-a-trip-to-the-bayou-state-to-face-lsu-and-la-lafayette/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-12/ucsb-takes-a-trip-to-the-bayou-state-to-face-lsu-and-la-lafayette/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-12/ucsb-takes-a-trip-to-the-bayou-state-to-face-lsu-and-la-lafayette/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-12/ucsb-takes-a-trip-to-the-bayou-state-to-face-lsu-and-la-lafayette/","id":368,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[367,366,365],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
