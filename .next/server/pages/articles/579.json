Northridge’s defense bothered the Gauchos’ offense the entirety of the game with Santa Barbara struggling to get a quality shot off. Only one player for UCSB finished in double-figures with Nesbit tallying 13 points and six rebounds on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Yet, this is Carlene Mitchell’s team and per usual for her, the problem was on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>“Some of (the offensive troubles) can be pressing too much. Some of that can be taking the wrong shots. I don’t worry about it,” Mitchell said. “It is the defensive side of it. I pulled the stats out from last year for the team and last year we scored 45, we scored 55 and maybe 47 against Northridge. So, here’s that double edge sword that we scored 70 in the first three games and most of the first half of the season, so offense is going to be the question, but my question is, ‘how can we score 46 but also win the game?’”</p>\n<p>Northridge shot 44.8 percent from the field. The Matadors also outscored the Gauchos 34-10 in the paint and outrebounded them 45-31.</p>\n<p>After allowing Northridge to go on the 17-2 run in the first half, Santa Barbara then didn’t contain the Matadors to open the second half, allowing them to start the final period on an 8-1 run, which eventually reached a game-high 24 points.</p>\n<p>“We know we need to stick to our defensive principles,” Nesbit said. “At times, we have lapses in defense, but we know as long as we continue to turn up the intensity on defense and stick to the fundamentals that we’ll be okay.”</p>\n<p>Needing to come from behind has become a recent trend for UCSB, falling behind by large deficits in all three Big West games, and the team hasn’t fared well, going 0-3 in those games.</p>\n<p>“As we continue on the season, we need to learn to put two halves together,” Nesbit said. “We sometimes come out flat in the second half and that tends to snowball, but we know that we need to come out with intensity in both halves.”</p>\n<p>Individually, Janae Sharpe led her team with 18 points, eight rebounds and four assists. She was one of three players in double-figures for Northridge. 6’3’’ sophomore center Bernadette Fong, who averages just 5.8 points per game, made UCSB pay down low, scoring 16 points.</p>\n<p>The loss snaps a 14 game win streak over Northridge and emphasized the struggles of UCSB recently. The team has dropped eight of its last nine games with its last win coming on Dec. 28.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the Gauchos remain winless in Big West play, dropping to 5-11 overall and 0-3 in conference. Northridge, on the other hand, improves to 7-11 overall and 3-1 in league.</p>\n<p>“We have the answers within us, but its how do we put that together?” Mitchell said. “Talent alone is never enough. I’ll continue to say in our conference, we’re one of the most talented, but at this point, we haven’t meshed as a team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to action Thursday against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-19/ucsb-downed-by-northridge/","id":579,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[578,577,576],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Everyone Looks Up to These Gauchos … Literally","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Nexus Sports Sits Down With the Big Men of the UCSB Men’s Basketball Team","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I had the chance to sit with Sam Beeler, Alan Williams and Mitch Brewe yesterday at practice and got to know them a little better.

You go around and you can just hang around with basically anybody, have a good time on weekends and have a good time in class. It’s challenging enough for it to be difficult, but it’s also easygoing enough for you to have a good time and enjoy your college experience.</p>\n<p>Brewe: The people know how to have a good time but still are smart and kick ass in school. Which is crazy because it’s such a good academic university even though it’s Isla Vista and all that crazy stuff going on … ­­to still be academically focused, that’s pretty cool too. And the beach, too! It’s awesome being around the beach.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Has there been a funny incident or something unusual that happens to you because you’re tall?</strong></p>\n<p>Brewe: I ride my long board everywhere and this tiny Asian girl riding her long board got so indecisive when she saw me coming, she just totally bailed out and fell into the grass and I was literally like five feet away from her and not going to hit her whatsoever. She literally just tumbled into the grass with her backpack and everybody was like, “What just happened?” I think I kind of intimidated her off her skateboard a little bit.</p>\n<p>Williams: Spider webs suck when you’re big and tall. Another thing is when you walk around, everybody looks up at you and stares in awe. You just get a whole bunch of crazy looks all the time.</p>\n<p>Beeler: My shower at home is terrible. I bend down in it all the time and I end up just sitting in it. The most common thing is I’ll be sitting in class next to someone, and I’ve already been sitting in there prior to them coming in, so we’re just talking or whatever and class ends and I get up and they’re like, “Oh my God, like, you’re huge. I didn’t realize it when you were sitting down.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Do people usually ask you about your height?</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Williams: Everybody asks me, “Can I ask you a question?” It’s just like, yeah of course, I already know what you’re going to ask: “How tall am I?” So, you just tell them, “6’8”.” And they’re like, “Oh my God, that’s so tall.” They ask us how tall we are all the time. You should see Sam in airports, it’s ridiculous. Sam in an airport gathers so much attention because he’s 6’11”. He’s just huge and everybody will ask him how tall he is.</p>\n<p>Beeler: And then it’s all the jokes that you’ve heard before too. I know some people get offended by it or whatever, but for me I just try to be nice about it. I’m so used to it at this point it doesn’t even bother me. It’s just another thing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite part about being a basketball player?</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: I’d say it’s the travel for me. I’ve been so many places thanks to just playing basketball in general; just places I’d never imagined going. Sometimes it’s a bad thing that I’m in the middle of nowhere, Northern Illinois or something like that. A lot of times you get to go to a lot of places like Hawaii, Seattle, Salt Lake (City), Louisiana. It’s awesome to be able to experience that, especially with people that you actually like being around too.</p>\n<p>Brewe: This is going to be corny, but I kind of like representing the school, like being a part of something bigger, you know. Being a part of the university and being kind of a face of the university, and hopefully we can set a good example and be a good part of the legacy here. I think that’s pretty cool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Is it tough balancing being a normal college student while being a student athlete?</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: There’s no “normal” being a college student when you’re an athlete because it’s just so time-consuming. But you get to do the simple stuff sometimes. It’s good when you have a couple days off and you can relax and go to the beach or relax and go hang out with your friends. But a lot of times our focus is always on getting better every day. We spend countless hours shooting in the gym or lifting and stuff like that. In everything we do, we try to incorporate how it’s going to make us a better player, and if that means we can go and hang out on the side, that’s a good thing. We put our sports and our academics first all the time.</p>\n<p>Beeler: That’s the thing about being a student athlete; you have to figure out the balance and time management, that’s a big thing.</p>\n<p>Williams: Mitch is like a super smart, A-plus student so he can tell you all about that.</p>\n<p>Brewe: Finding the time for homework is the hardest. You get home from practice and you just want to lie in your bed and not do a thing. I just want to sleep. But you have to get home and you have to be like, “In 10 minutes I’m going to open this damn book and I’m going to read.” Really just committing yourself is pretty tough. Like these guys said, it’s time consuming but I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Do you guys ever get a chance to go out on DP and do you go as a team?</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: All the time, definitely. We hang out a lot, especially on the weekends when we get a couple of days off if we don’t have practice the next day we’ll go out and enjoy ourselves out there. But we always know there are consequences with doing that kind of stuff. We’re seen as, like you said, someone other than just a normal college student and whatever we do represents our team and our university in either a positive or negative way. When we’re out there, we do it in a smart way and we’re always safe.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tell UCSB students why they should come out and watch you play Long Beach on Thursday.</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: It’s fun; it’s a great energy. You see a fast-paced kind of sport. We’re up and down, we’re dunking the ball and three-point shots ­­­— all that kind of stuff. It’s a lot of intensity and it’s a lot of tradition that goes into UCSB basketball. We put in a lot of hard work for this university, so it’d be great to have them come out and support us.</p>\n<p>Beeler: It’s fun for us when we get big crowds like that and hopefully it’s fun for them to come and be a big crowd. We’re super grateful for the people who do come out and it’s just awesome when they do.</p>\n<p>Williams: And it’s on TV too. Be on SportsCenter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53531\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53531\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/","id":576,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[575,574,573],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Rival Long Beach State in Televised Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Brock_BBall_1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Brock_BBall_1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hosts Long Beach State at 8 p.m. on ESPNU.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Crowded stands are becoming a regular sight at the Thunderdome for the UCSB men’s basketball team this season.

The big man is certainly motivated not to let the Gauchos lose a second straight game in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s definitely important for me; I haven’t beat them yet so it’d be good to get that first win over Long Beach,” Big Al said. “It’s always been a big rivalry: they’ve always been known to play us really tough and us to play them really tough in return. It should be a lot of exciting play on Thursday.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach enters the contest with a 5-11 overall record and 1-1 mark in conference play. The 49ers began Big West play with a narrow loss to UC Irvine on Thursday before handily beating UC Davis on Saturday. Despite sporting a losing record, Long Beach has faced a number of good teams this season, possessing the second strongest non-conference schedule in the nation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great game. Long Beach is a good team. They’ve played a lot of good teams this year,” sophomore guard Michael Bryson said. “Their record doesn’t show how good they are but we know what we need to do coming into this game and we’re going to make sure we come out of this game with a 1-1 record.”</p>\n<p>Bryson will face a tough test defensively as he will match up against junior guard Tyler Lamb, a transfer from UCLA in his first year with Long Beach, who has averaged over 18 points per game in his six games of play since becoming eligible in late December.</p>\n<p>Other Long Beach players to watch will be junior guard Michael Caffey and senior forward Dan Jennings. Caffey is sixth in the conference averaging 16 points per game, while Jennings is fourth in rebounds with 7.5 boards per game. UCSB junior point guard Zalmico Harmon and Big Al will each face tough assignments against Caffey and Jennings.</p>\n<p>“I think [Harmon is] ready to play against Caffey. I think Caffey is a very good player, he does an excellent job,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They also have Jennings who is a great center and Tyler Lamb is one of the best wings in the league. We think Long Beach is one of the top teams in league.”</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to rebound from Saturday’s loss they will need Bryson along with sophomore forward Taran Brown and senior guard Kyle Boswell to hit outside shots. UCSB shot 2-17 in the loss to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“We put it behind us. We’re a team that we know we can shoot,” Bryson said. “We know that if we get inside to Al and he throws outside to us, he knows we’re going to knock it down for him. We just need to keep the same confidence.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has not defeated the 49ers since the 2011 Big West Tournament Championship Game, which sent the Gauchos to the NCAA Tournament. Fans can be sure the Gauchos will bring their A-game on Thursday in hopes of playing in front of another large crowd and a television audience.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s vital [when fans show up], especially for a lot of guys, it just gives something to play for and a lot more energy in the crowd so that we don’t have to produce it ourselves,” Big Al said. “We’re going to come out and play with our own intensity and our own energy, but it always helps to have the crowd’s energy and support behind you.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s game against rival Long Beach State is scheduled for 8 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPNU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53568\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-16/ucsb-hosts-rival-long-beach-state-in-televised-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53568\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-16/ucsb-hosts-rival-long-beach-state-in-televised-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-16/ucsb-hosts-rival-long-beach-state-in-televised-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-16/ucsb-hosts-rival-long-beach-state-in-televised-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-16/ucsb-hosts-rival-long-beach-state-in-televised-game/","id":577,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[576,575,574],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Long Beach State in ESPN Televised Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB snapped a five-game losing streak to Long Beach State on Thursday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It had been three seasons and five straight games that Long Beach State had UCSB’s number.

Tied at 24 and with the final possession, freshman point guard Eric Childress made a brilliant pass to sophomore forward Sam Beeler who slammed the ball home a second before the halftime buzzer to give UCSB a 26-24 lead at the break.</p>\n<p>A quick 9-0 start to the second half stretched the Gaucho lead and UCSB continued to push the 49ers, eventually building a 50-31 lead with just under nine minutes remaining in the contest. Long Beach would rally to as close as eight points with over four minutes left to play by forcing numerous turnovers, but the Gauchos quickly shut the door on any comeback hopes.</p>\n<p>Bryson twice drove baseline and dunked the ball over Long Beach defenders, sandwiching a Sportscenter worthy dunk by sophomore forward Taran Brown that put the game away for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I was really happy with the fact that there was some aggressive straight line drives by Michael and Taran, that [Zalmico] was more aggressive,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “[I was happy] everybody else on the team felt the need to step up and be more of a weapon offensively because we put too much on pressure on Al when we don’t.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Alan Williams who entered the game third in the nation averaging over 24 points per game was held to 12 points in the contest, his second fewest this season. Despite Williams’s lack of scoring, the big man still managed to pull down 15 rebounds, improving his pre-game average of 11.1 per game which ranked sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>Bryson finished the contest with a team-high 13 points to go along with nine rebounds for the Gauchos. Brewe, meanwhile, registered a career-high 12 points and finished 2-2 from behind the three-point line, a recent addition to the power forward’s game.</p>\n<p>“It was important that we had other players make plays,” Coach Williams said. “I think what Long Beach watched was the Cal Poly game where other players didn’t make plays and Al had to carry the load with 33 and 15. What I liked best is Al only gets 12 tonight but he has 15 rebounds again. He stayed after it.”</p>\n<p>Point guard play was certainly a factor in this game as junior guard Zalmico Harmon scored seven points to go along with a game-high nine assists for the Gauchos. Long Beach junior point guard Michael Caffey led the team with 21 points but his impact was matched by Harmon’s intensity on the floor.</p>\n<p>“I thought Z was very aggressive and we addressed that and asked him to raise his aggression level. Z has been good as an assist to turnover guy on the year,” Coach Williams said. “For us, the idea that Z was aggressive, that Z scored seven points and gets nine assists, those are good numbers.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard Kyle Boswell finished with eight points and shot 2-5 from behind the arc, while Brown scored six points and pulled down four rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite turning the ball over 12 more times than Long Beach, the Gauchos were efficient with the shot opportunities they had, shooting over 50 percent for the game and 40 percent from the three.</p>\n<p>Long Beach finished 5-27 from three-point land as only one 49er finished the game in double-digit scoring. The 49ers struggled against Santa Barbara’s zone defense as the Gauchos closed down on shooters and forced Long Beach to take plenty of contested outside jumpers.</p>\n<p>“The zone really affected them. The rotations we’ve been working on constantly in practice really came into play in that game,” Brewe said. “And you won’t see a Long Beach team shoot 30 percent very often.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s victory ended a three-game homestand for UCSB in which the Gauchos twice saw large crowds support the team. UCSB will miss the comforts of the Thunderdome as it now embarks on a three-game road trip.</p>\n<p>“It was good for the fans too because they always show great support,” Harmon said. “It was good to get them a win, and get everybody back in the swing of things and show everybody we are the team that we know we are.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to face Cal State Northridge on Saturday for a 7:30 p.m. contest that will be televised live on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/","id":578,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[577,576,575],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
