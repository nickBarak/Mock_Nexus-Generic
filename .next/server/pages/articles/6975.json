The course will be taught by none other than Bay Area’s own and internationally celebrated professor, Earl Stevens. Professor Stevens, however, prefers his future pupils to call him by his stage name, E-40, short for extra 40 pounds.</p>\n<p>Professor Stevens, or E-40, on his own leisurely time, is also a bona fide rapper-musician whose musical achievements are downloaded and listened to across the country. For UCSB to get E-40 to teach and share his knowledge to masses of students is a tremendous coup. The online UCSB registration system, GOLD, will definitely suffer the repercussions of the copious amount of sign-ups this summer due to the guaranteed exceptionally long waitlist. So, Gauchos, pray to the Bay Area god that your pass time is early enough to obtain a coveted spot.</p>\n<p>Just kidding. E-40 is not going to be teaching a course on his infamous slang vocabulary, but he did perform at The Hub on Thursday, May 7 to a sold-out concert. The concert was a hot ticket event two weeks before it even occurred. Tickets sold out in one day. In fact, the very last ticket was sold at 2 p.m. on April 22 (I was in line and it sold out right in front of eyes). But for those who were lucky enough to get their hands on the heavily prized ticket via the box office or the third party individuals (a.k.a. vile human beings selling an OG $14.75 ticket for prices at $40+ on the Free &amp; For Sale page), were in for one hell of night, or I should say, “hella” night.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>****</p>\n<p>Before I get into reviewing the concert, I want to get into some history. Yes, this review has become a first-person narrative because it is too personal not to be. I can still recall in the fifth grade at the Norwood Creek Elementary in San Jose, California (still considered the Bay) when I would blast E-40 on my royal blue iPod Nano with all my friends during recess and after-school studies. We would imagine the day when we’d have our own cars, not to drive, but to put the gear on neutral, open all the doors, blast E-40 on the speakers, get out of the car and dance around it as it moves. This is also known as ghost riding the whip — introduced in 40’s old-school record, <em>Tell Me When To Go</em>.” The Vallejo native has shaped my young adolescence from elementary, middle and high school years through his classic hits like “You And That Booty” and “My Shit Bang” at every school dance. To be able to see the Bay Area god perform live has been a lifelong goal of mine, and thanks to A.S. Program Board, I have now crossed it off my bucket list.</p>\n<p>The night started out full of excitement and a little bit of pregame drunkenness, just like any potential great night should. The line to enter The Hub grew longer and longer as 8:30 p.m. came closer. Slowly and surely, after people passed through body-checks and ticket-scans, the concert was finally upon us. Unfortunately, the wait time to see the rapper (two hours) felt like forever because unknown, irrelevant hip-hop groups and trap singers were opening and hyping up the show. After being pushed around in the claustrophobic madness of eager E-40 fans for what seemed like an eternity, I was able to position myself in the front row.</p>\n<p>The final, long-awaited act of the night had arrived. Dressed in a casual, yet obviously expensive, black T-shirt, black denim, a thick gold chain necklace and black matte Balenciaga Arena high-top sneakers, E-40 burst through the stage with hit after hit, along with his hype-man, Bigomeezy. The crowd went wild and grew louder as old school records were performed. Every lyric was memorized and yelled across the stage every time the hip-hop artist shoved his microphone into the audience. Giant radio songs, such as those mentioned above, and album standouts such as “Yay Area,” “White Gurl” and “Choices (Yup)” were all favored and appreciated by zealous Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Put up for your five!” E-40 shouted while gesturing his entire hand to the sky as he introduced his remix of the classic “I Got 5 On It.”</p>\n<p>After an impressive list of old-school hits, the R&amp;B crooner ended his set with his most recent chart-topper with Big Sean, “I Don’t Fuck With You.” The entire room completely lit up when the initial, recognizable beat dropped. The song has become undoubtedly one of the top “turn-up” songs thus far of 2015. So, when the lyrical genius decided to perform the song as his final dessert after an array of finger appetizers and delicious entrees, the concert became one of the most amazing and memorable events at UCSB in a really long time.</p>\n<p>Though E-40 has been off the radar for a period of time, his reemergence in Big Sean’s number-one hit and appearance at UCSB is an indication that time and age are not limitations for the 47-year-old. There are high hopes that modern fifth-graders will soon be blessed with new music from the Bay Area rapper. E-40 is the godfather of modern hip-hop because he introduced the vast vocabulary of R&amp;B slang terms that has been mentioned in every hip-hop record. But most importantly, I would not be the person I am today if I had never “popped my collar,” “got hyphy” and “flamboasted.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63570\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/get-hyphy-with-e-40-ucsb-gets-a-taste-of-yay-area/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63570\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/get-hyphy-with-e-40-ucsb-gets-a-taste-of-yay-area/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/get-hyphy-with-e-40-ucsb-gets-a-taste-of-yay-area/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/get-hyphy-with-e-40-ucsb-gets-a-taste-of-yay-area/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/get-hyphy-with-e-40-ucsb-gets-a-taste-of-yay-area/","id":6975,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[6974,6973,6972],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen","biography":"Not available","articles":[5863,5906,5980,6042,6068,6754,6762,6780,6826,6833,6886,6897,6905,6975,7017],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Burgerama: Weezer and Black Lips Headline Costa Mesa Fest","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Burgerama-art-traced.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Burgerama-art-traced.jpg?resize=616%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A swarm of guys, girls and everything in between amassed in their funkiest thrift shop getups at the Observatory last weekend in Costa Mesa, California.

The usually cozy venue was transformed into a three-stage rock festival, complete with an outdoor stage, vendor tents and port-a-potties in the parking lot. The norm was colored hair and the fashion sense of Sid Vicious if he’d lived in Southern California and had an affinity for LSD. Some string lights thrown around the trees and block letters on the roof spelling BURGERAMA officialized the two-day festival, which is put on by the Burger Record label.</p>\n<p>All-ages events can typically go one of two ways: a lot of little kids, or a cohesive mixture of young and old. Burgerama was of the latter sort, drawing in an eclectic crowd consisting of middle- and high-schoolers, college students, young parents with small kids and even a small middle-aged fanbase. Many band members could be spotted anonymously roaming around after their sets. Despite the wide age range and harshly edgy styles, the vibe was unanimously friendly and laid back. To say the least, it was pretty weird — in a good way. It was the kind of weird that ensures you can look and act in any way you like without fear of being judged.</p>\n<p>Despite donning nothing but a leather thong and face paint, King Khan and the BBQ Show singer, BBQ, was sure to also cater his set to the younger kids in the crowd. A song about a bird that gets addicted to some “white powder” inside a bird feeder segued into a short anti-drug rant. The rock duo encouraged fans to tell drug pushers to “shove it back up your ass.” This was met with heart-warming cheers and applause from the audience.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The 21+ crew (or anyone with the means to obtain a colored wristband) enjoyed access to two beer gardens located on either side of the main stage where they could see headliners like Weezer and Ty Segall from close side location. Other commodities included tacos, burgers, ice cream and T-Shirt stands — one of which featured Blake Anderson of Workaholics for meet and greets.</p>\n<p>The indoor stages were more dance-friendly albeit cramped, thanks to the psychedelic sounds of Mr. Elevator and the Brain Hotel, and the spacey Craft Spells. Shannon and the Clams also transformed the room into a vintage dancehall with their retro doo-wop sound.</p>\n<p>The event lasted from noon to midnight each day. As the sweltering heat of the afternoon gave in to skin-chilling evenings, the crowds outside grew larger for the more anticipated performances of headliners. Although not necessarily a headliner, pop-punk group Cherry Glazerr was one of the most buzzed about acts. Perhaps it was because two of the three members are teenage girls (seniors in high school), who are already living the dream of being legitimate rockstars and touring their way to fame and notoriety. But even more hype-worthy was the setlist, with each song acting as two-minute bursts of rapid-paced angst and energy. Their set paid homage to the highs and lows of teenage girlhood with songs like “Grilled Cheese” and “White’s Not My Color This Evening,” a song about menstrual pains.</p>\n<p>The outdoor stage was packed tight as fans excitedly awaited the Black Lips. Fifteen minutes after their designated set time, riotous cheers finally welcomed them to the stage. Within seconds of their first song, the entire audience evolved into a passionate, adrenaline-charged mosh pit. Drunken bodies vehemently flung around while others crouched away hoping to avoid this fearsome fate, but to no avail. This reporter’s hair momentarily caught on fire during her rigorous escape; it was pretty gnarly, but also fun, if you’re into that sort of thing. From the eventual outskirts of the mob, the band was just as enjoyable with songs like “Bad Kids” and “Family Tree.”</p>\n<p>It’s no secret that audiences love to hear bands shout out their hometown for some strange, intrinsic reason. Zac Carper, the lead singer of FIDLAR, incorporated nostalgia to the area by proclaiming “I lost my virginity in Orange County, to some Catholic school Mater Dei girl in a Jack-in-the-Box parking lot.” This was the perfect introduction to their song “Awkward,” which spread a head-banging tone into the crowd. Later on, “Cheap Beer” became a huge hit amongst those listening from the beer gardens. It was an appropriate moment.</p>\n<p>All things considered, there was perhaps no greater unifying moment of the festival than that of Weezer’s set. Everyone in the western United States instinctively knows every word of modern-day classics “Beverly Hills” and “The Sweater Song,” two songs which are the most fun lyrics to shout in a drunken sea of fans. After playing “Say It Ain’t So,” singer Rivers Cuomo introduced his father onstage. It was an endearing moment placed after a song that directs a certain amount of rage, presumably towards said father.</p>\n<p>On these two sweaty days and goosebump nights on the grungier side of Orange County, right on the brink of festival season, Burgerama played out to be an all over success. Sure, there were moments of technical difficulties and unruly crowds met with uptight security. But these were few and far in between, and they were more than outbalanced by moments of cohesive endearment and serendipitous joy. In the end, you were still left with that goofy post-festival grin days afterward, repeatedly reminiscing on the weekend’s best moments.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61979\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/burgerama-weezer-and-black-lips-headline-costa-mesa-fest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61979\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/burgerama-weezer-and-black-lips-headline-costa-mesa-fest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/burgerama-weezer-and-black-lips-headline-costa-mesa-fest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/burgerama-weezer-and-black-lips-headline-costa-mesa-fest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/burgerama-weezer-and-black-lips-headline-costa-mesa-fest/","id":6972,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[6971,6970,6969],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Interview with CORNERS","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/0003460348_10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/0003460348_10.jpg?resize=640%2C640&ssl=1","description":"Coming from Echo Park, L.A., post-punk band CORNERS talked to me after their Burgerama set last weekend about raunchy show happenings and good energy.

It’s nice to play on a big stage with a good sound system, and if you’re around a bunch of people, you can feel their energy. But same thing goes where if you’re playing at a super small spot and it’s packed with crazy energy. I personally just judge it on the energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Rick Mabery:</strong> Yeah, I think we all do.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>How would you describe the energy today?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> It was gooood. I think, being at 12 o’clock noon, it was surprisingly good. The crowd felt cool — it was a good combination.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracy Bryant:</strong> This place is always fun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>How do you guys pass time on the road when you’re traveling?</p>\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> Jokes are fun. We have a lot of stupid jokes we like to tell.</p>\n<p><strong>TB:</strong> Or we like to look at peoples’ Instagrams and make fun of them.</p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>Like whose?</p>\n<p><strong>TB:</strong> I’m not gonna say! Just weird people, not in a mean way.</p>\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> Also, listening to music is cool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>What is the weirdest thing you’ve ever seen at one of your shows?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> One show at Salt Lake City on the last tour was kind of raunchy. There was somebody having sex outside of a show we played in Salt Lake, the Mormon capital of the world. There was like a … I don’t know, I didn’t really see it personally I just saw the pictures but …</p>\n<p><strong>TB:</strong> It’s kind of weird to describe — like you know how people circle around when there’s a fight? It was kind of like that. It was very … it was weird.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> There was also a fight that day, too. There was a fight in the show and some weird sex activities outside the show.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>What is your dream tour location?</p>\n<p><strong>Band: </strong>Probably somewhere beachy, like Australia’s really fun. Maybe like Hawaii would be awesome. Somewhere that you would want to vacation to, and then you get to play shows, too. Kill two birds in one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>Who are your favorite bands?</p>\n<p><strong>TB:</strong> We don’t play favorites. There’s an eclectic amount of bands that we really like. Yeah, we all like different stuff. There’s bands that we all like. We all like The Cure, The Smiths, we like Joy Division.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> I saw Blonde Redhead play here the other day. That was really cool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>What is the most boring city you’ve played a show in?</p>\n<p><strong>TB:</strong> Not really boring, but we played in Beaumont, Texas and it wasn’t boring, it was fun, but the town was definitely, like, they were looking at us like we were from Mars or something.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> I played in Fargo before. That was really … boring.</p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>Like in the movie Fargo?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah, it was just like the movie. People were killing each other.</p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>Was Steve Buscemi there?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Yeah, that was the best part of all.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>What has been your most surreal moment [as a band]?</p>\n<p><strong>TB:</strong> Today’s pretty cool, I mean, I bought fucking Weezer’s CD when I was 10 years old so to be on a bill with a band like that is pretty wild. The Blue Album is a pretty big part of like everybody’s life, you know? Same with Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony that was just music that was playing all through our middle school. So it’s pretty cool, stuff like that.</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> Now we’re on a lineup with them, it’s kind of weird. Or not weird, but like you said, weird in a good way.</p>\n<p><strong>TB:</strong> It’s surreal, yeah.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>NB: </strong>What is your favorite song that you’ve written?</p>\n<p><strong>JR:</strong> I really like the song We’re Changing. I can say that cause I didn’t write it, Tracy wrote it, and I like it a lot. Maybe the new song that we all wrote together.</p>\n<p><strong>TB:</strong> There’s a new song that we all wrote together, I think that’s one of the best songs that I’ve ever been a part of, personally.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/interview-with-corners/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/interview-with-corners/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/interview-with-corners/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/interview-with-corners/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/interview-with-corners/","id":6973,"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor"},"related":[6972,6971,6970],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lucidity Festival","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-12.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-12.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"This year’s Lucidity arts and music festival was nothing short of magic.

From offering live instrumental music and electronic bass music to unbelievably beautiful art installations and stunning dance and theater performances to healing and growing workshops and more, this past weekend’s three-day arts and music festival did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>Held in Santa Barbara’s own backyard within the Santa Ynez mountains, Lucidity invited attendees to bask in a whirlwind of the sickest of fine art, the dopest of musical talent and the most stimulating of multi-sensory experiences. With a commitment to sustainability, environmental responsibility, community reciprocity and personal growth, Lucidity offered participants an opportunity to creatively and artistically co-create the open-source, transformational arts and music festival of their dreams.</p>\n<p>The first night of the festival, Berkeley-based electronic producer Thriftworks headlined the main stage with explosive, beat-crafting modern bass and eclectic synth samples along to a Technicolor laser lightshow unparalleled by many other concert lightshows on the West Coast. Concurrently, the world instrument/beat duo Dirtwire mesmerized audiences with sultry, traditional world music and roots tunes, sporting a myriad of instruments like the kalimba, the sitar and other obscure, mostly Middle Eastern instruments.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>According to Lucidity Co-Founder and Marketing Director Jonah Haas, along with showcasing musical stages, themed camping villages, sustainable and organic local food stands, a curated art gallery and workshops, Lucidity this year was all about community and education.</p>\n<p>“Lucidity is a place for students of the Great Mystery, students of life,” Haas said. “Lucidity is a place where magic is real, where authentic community connection is easy, and where you might learn some things that are not taught in traditional schools. There’s a ton of really inspiring educational content this year.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, a particularly notable facet of the festival had everything to do with the music. Headliner and glitch hop DJ the Polish Ambassador, a musician who also happens to be spearheading a nationwide sustainability education program called “Pushing Through The Pavement Tour,” has been traveling the nation introducing communities to permaculture design processes. The workshops include introductions to rainwater harvesting, natural building, regenerative techniques, permaculture gardening, composting, ecological principles and more.</p>\n<p>Permaculture Action Course community organizer Ryan Rising, who worked at the Permaculture Action Hub at the festival last weekend, said Lucidity offered festival-goers the opportunity to learn about everything related to permaculture — including regenerative ecology, social change, community organizing and more — for free.</p>\n<p>According to Rising, Lucidity Permaculture Action Hub staff would start teaching workshops in the morning for the first couple hours of the festival with children’s education and youth permaculture education, and then would move on to DIY skill-shares, as well as “more hands-on stuff” such as making botanical medicine, lessons on how to make kombuchas, fermented sodas and even environmentally-friendly soaps and deodorants.</p>\n<p>“Today we’re going to have an introduction to permaculture, a soils and compost workshop, followed by rain-water harvesting techniques,” Rising said, prepping for a long day of teaching while under a multi-colored cloth awning at the festival. “There’s a rewilding workshop, and a social permaculture panel discussion later on. At night we end everything off with a mycelial mixer, a networking party for permaculture folks.”</p>\n<p>Lucidity’s penchant toward substantive, forward-thinking sustainability is no secret, as big-time publications have begun to turn their eyes and ears toward the festival’s progressive efforts.</p>\n<p>“The feedback has been really amazing,” Rising said. “We got into the <em>Huffington Post</em> for the permaculture action course.”</p>\n<p>These efforts coincide with Lucidity’s recent decision to reduce attendees after Santa Barbara County asked the organization to reduce their overall capacity numbers due to concerns about the festival’s ecological impact, including the Santa Ynez Valley’s drought cycle as well as the impact of parking by cars on top of oak tree roots.</p>\n<p>“The biggest challenge has been reducing our car camping option. Last year we had 1100 cars up onsite. This year, it’s looking like we will have less than 500,” Haas said. “Making this sort of reduction when people have come to expect certain things is difficult. But we look forward to there being more space onsite and less crowding.”</p>\n<p>It is this very dedication to “Leaving It Better” that makes Lucidity a gratifyingly unique experience, leaving festival-goers with a sense of social responsibility along with memories many may not remember, with people they’ll never forget.</p>\n<p>“One of the things that horrified me the one time I went to Coachella was how everyone just threw their trash all over the grounds. I have the image of tractors piling up mountains of single-use plastic bottles when they turned the lights on at night,” Haas said. “Lucidity endeavors to be as sustainable and environmentally responsible as possible. We have a variety of initiatives that reduce our footprint and extend a deeper respect for the land.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYn4-_KR3MY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_62476\" style=\"width: 407px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1613991783\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62548\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62476\" data-attachment-id=\"62476\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/lucidity-festival/lucidity_emily-rogers-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?fit=397%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"397,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428709661\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"1400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lucidity_Emily Rogers-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?fit=397%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62476\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?resize=397%2C600\" alt=\"Emily Rogers/Daily Nexus\" width=\"397\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?w=397&amp;ssl=1 397w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lucidity_Emily-Rogers-1.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-62476\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Emily Rogers</em>/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62548\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/lucidity-festival/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62548\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/lucidity-festival/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/lucidity-festival/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/lucidity-festival/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/lucidity-festival/","id":6974,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[6973,6972,6971],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
