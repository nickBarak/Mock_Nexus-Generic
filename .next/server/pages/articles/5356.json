With a season-high four-game losing streak, the Gauchos come into tonight’s match with renewed focus.</p>\n<p>“We lost a few games in a row but the good news is this week is a new week and we have three games this week,” sophomore outside hitter Kevin Donohue said. “I think we’re all excited to get back on the court as soon as possible and snap this losing streak, and we’re going to get ready for Princeton.”</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara is already well under way with its conference schedule, Princeton will play its first game of the season against the Gauchos on its way to preparing itself for the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association conference season. Even though this match is nothing more than friendly for UCSB (3-5 overall, 1-4 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation), the team still understands the potential implications of the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’ll definitely be a confidence booster if we win and it’ll help us on our paths to getting better,” sophomore opposite Matt Marsh said.</p>\n<p>In what will be its third game in four days, tonight’s matchup will also be UCSB’s first game of three scheduled for the week — the most games in a week the team will play all season long. After tonight’s game, Santa Barbara will once again commence its conference schedule against No. 2 UC Irvine on Wednesday, followed by a game on Friday versus No. 12 UC San Diego.</p>\n<p>“We definitely just have to focus on staying healthy and staying strong for the season, and this week will be a test,” Donohue said. “… [Maybe] we’ll play a little fatigued but we just have to play past that and get our mind and body ready to go for this week.”</p>\n<p>Serving has been key for the Gauchos all season long and has been a part of their game they have been unable to execute during their four-game losing streak. The serving game will be just as important against the Tigers and will be a critical factor in helping out the Gauchos on the defensive side of the ball.</p>\n<p>“The main thing is we’re definitely going to work on serving and if we keep our serves in, it’ll help us out on blocking,” Marsh said. “We need a couple of stops so we can put Princeton in trouble and overall we just need to be aggressors as a team.”</p>\n<p>On offense, UCSB will rely on freshman setter Jonah Seif to distribute the ball and organize the offensive attack for the Gauchos. Averaging 10.37 assists per game, Seif ranks seventh in the MPSF and he will have the responsibility of getting the ball to Marsh, who leads the team with 83 kills on the season.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game against Princeton is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 29th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49812\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/gauchos-prep-for-princeton-after-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49812\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/gauchos-prep-for-princeton-after-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/gauchos-prep-for-princeton-after-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/gauchos-prep-for-princeton-after-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/gauchos-prep-for-princeton-after-skid/","id":5356,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5355,5354,5353],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Drop First Away Game of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The first road game of the season did not go as planned for the No. 9 UCSB men’s volleyball team as it lost in five sets against No. 11 Cal State Northridge Friday night, snapping the team’s three...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The first road game of the season did not go as planned for the No. 9 UCSB men’s volleyball team as it lost in five sets against No. 11 Cal State Northridge Friday night, snapping the team’s three-game win streak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were outlasted by the Matadors in the final set, dropping the team’s record to 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the MPSF.

On Tuesday afternoon, Head Coach Kathy Gregory officially announced in a press conference full of supportive and adoring players, coaches, alumni and faculty that after 38 years, she was moving on.</p>\n<p>“I really did not think I would be coaching for 38 years,” Gregory said. “I look at myself and say how blessed and lucky I am to be able to do something that doesn’t kill you, doesn’t make you hate it or want to walk away. I am the lucky one. Everyone sitting here today realize that I have something special.”</p>\n<p>Gregory leaves behind a large and lasting legacy. She compiled 882 wins, the fifth most in NCAA Division I history. Under her guidance, the Gauchos went on to 27 NCAA Tournaments and, along with only three other schools, advanced to the first 26. Gregory also took her team to the NCAA Elite Eight three times and to the Sweet Sixteen two more times. She was honored as the AVCA National Coach of the Year in 1993, was a four-time AVCA West Region Coach of the Year and a seven-time Big West Conference Coach of the Year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To Gregory, what was even more important than winning was the success and growth of her players.</p>\n<p>“The most important part of this job that I want people to realize is the students and the fact that you have to impact their lives,” Gregory said. “I am not the easiest coach, I’ll be the first to say it, but life is not easy. Life is very demanding. The challenges that all of us have faced and are going to face is what real competitors are about.”</p>\n<p>Current and past players spoke about the honor it was to play under the direction of Gregory and what it meant to be a student of her game.</p>\n<p>“It means the world to me to be a part of this with Kathy, because she has done everything for me and I will owe her everything the rest of my life and try and repay her with what she has taught me throughout the four years I played at Santa Barbara,” former player Dana Vargas said. “I would not be the young woman that I am today without Kathy. Kathy always shows you the big picture and things to concentrate on, and I am so thankful.”</p>\n<p>Speaking on behalf of the current women’s volleyball team was junior middle blocker Jenna Wilson.</p>\n<p>“I can say you’re the toughest coach I have ever had by far, and anyone who has played for her knows that,” Wilson said. “But I am so grateful. I wouldn’t have it any other way because you have taught us so much about life, not just volleyball, and helped us to grow so much. At the same time, there was never a dull moment with you.”</p>\n<p>Gregory’s infamous energy could not be calmed even on her final day. Throughout the conference she had been lively and enjoyed her time. It had been quite clear this was not a sad moment, but as she came to the end of her address, she let all in attendance know exactly how exciting it was to be around her, much to the amusement to the audience.</p>\n<p>“Everyone asks you ‘How do you want to be remembered?’ Alright, I want to tell you how I want to be remembered. Number one, I want to be remembered for commitment and always giving 100 percent of myself to this job and this program for 38 years. Two, 100 percent graduation rate of any woman that played for me for four years. Three, I lived my life filled with gratitude and appreciation for all the opportunities that I have had in my life and I have tried to instill that attitude into my players. And four, I walked away with the same competitive fire and energy that I had when I started this in 1975.”</p>\n<p>Gregory may be stepping down as head coach, but she may be moving to other endeavors on campus.</p>\n<p>“It is not the end for Kathy. We are going to ask her to look at the possibility of us starting a beach volleyball program.” UCSB Athletics Director Mark Massari said. “The NCAA announced that as an emerging sport recently. I have held off on that a little bit. Kathy has wanted to push for that. I have held off to be sure we are in it to win it. I know we are now, so she is going to start that with us.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/kathy-gregory-announces-retirement/","id":5354,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[5353,5352,5351],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Seek to Avenge Five Set Loss When Hosting UCLA Friday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Payback will be the mindset for the No. 8 UCSB men’s volleyball team this Friday at Rob Gym as they prepare to host No. 5 UCLA in a rematch of the first game of the season.

After losing to the Bruins in five sets in the first meeting, the Gauchos will finally have a shot at redeeming themselves in a game they have had circled on their calendar since the last time the two teams played.</p>\n<p>“The first match we played them was our very first game of the year and it was a close loss; we lost to them in five sets [after] being up 2-0 in that match,” sophomore outside hitter Kevin Donohue said. “Ever since that match has ended, we’ve had our sights for the game on Friday; we know we’re definitely a team capable of beating UCLA.”</p>\n<p>Last week’s defeat against Cal State Northridge ended the Gauchos’ three-game win streak and dropped them to 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the MPSF season, with each of the losses going the full five sets.

Offensively, UCSB will rely on the duo of sophomore outside hitter Austin Kingi, who leads the team in kills with 53 on the season, and sophomore Matt Marsh, who is second with 50 kills.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also look to its passing game to facilitate scoring opportunities to its hitters and throw off the UCLA defense.</p>\n<p>“We know from the service line we’re a great team and we can pass the ball well and get all our hitters going offensively; that’s going to be our biggest key against UCLA,” Donohue said. “The last four, six days, our biggest focus has been the serving pass and playing together, playing with fire and emotion, and getting ourselves mentally prepared to play UCLA.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at Rob Gym.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 18th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/gauchos-seek-avenge-set-loss-hosting-ucla-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/gauchos-seek-avenge-set-loss-hosting-ucla-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/gauchos-seek-avenge-set-loss-hosting-ucla-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/gauchos-seek-avenge-set-loss-hosting-ucla-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-18/gauchos-seek-avenge-set-loss-hosting-ucla-friday/","id":5355,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5354,5353,5352],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
