Upon searching the vehicle, officers located six Xanax pills and the suspect was booked into jail for possession of Xanax without a prescription, according to Signa, who said the search was made following a traffic stop.</p>\n<p>“Deputies made a traffic stop for a subject whom failed to signal when turning on Cordoba,” Signa said. “It was discovered that the suspect was on probation for drug sales. Per the terms of his probation, his vehicle was searched.”</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officials also responded to a call for an injured adult male at a house party on the 6700 block of Del Playa on Friday night. When they arrived to the residence, officers found the injured suspect, who is 19-20 years old, at the base of a staircase as well as a victim nearby, according to Signa. He also said the victim was pointing at the injured suspect and saying the suspect was “kicking subjects as they attempted to walk up the stairs.”</p>\n<p>“The suspect was arrested for battery and booked into jail,” Signa said. “It is unknown whether the suspect was a student or not.”</p>\n<p>In addition, deputies responded to a call from the 6700 block of Del Playa reporting a residential burglary that had occurred sometime between the previous night and early Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>“An unknown suspect entered the victim’s residence from an unlocked front door,” Signa said. “Two laptops — both MacBook Pros — were taken and the investigation is continuing.”</p>\n<p>A second burglary was also reported early Sunday morning from the apartment complexes at 781 Embarcadero Del Norte, with the incident involving the theft of three Apple Macbook Pro laptop computers from an apartment living room at 5 a.m.</p>\n<p>“One of the [female] victims heard someone moving around in the apartment and called 9-1-1,” Signa said. “Neighbors saw a suspect loitering around the apartment building before the theft [and] described [him] as a large athletic, black male adult about 6’2, wearing a black hoodie. The area was searched but they were unable to locate him.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, March 5, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54360\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-05/weekend-wrap-up-27/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54360\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-05/weekend-wrap-up-27/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-05/weekend-wrap-up-27/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-05/weekend-wrap-up-27/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-05/weekend-wrap-up-27/","id":3788,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3787,3786,3785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang","biography":"Not available","articles":[227,3070,3785,3787,3788,3790,3793,3796,3798,3799,3819],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Respond to Auto Thefts, Assaults","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to several crimes over the weekend, including a string of burglaries and multiple incidences of assault.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to several crimes over the weekend, including a string of burglaries and multiple incidences of assault.</p>\n<p>In addition to responding to several minor crimes, law enforcement officials investigated two incidences of physical assault and made arrests in connection to burglaries occurring throughout Isla Vista. IVFP Sherriff’s Lieutenant Robert Plastino said deputies encountered an individual stealing from a vehicle in an alleyway on Picasso Road on Thursday night.</p>\n<p>The suspect was identified as Sergio Torres, a resident from Ventura, who told officers he was visiting a friend. Lieutenant Plastino reported that Torres was found to be in possession of a mask, gloves, a flashlight and wire cutters.</p>\n<p>Shortly after officers requested additional sheriff units from Goleta, a man named Dennis Rizzo — who is a friend of Torres’s — was located and apprehended on the 700 block of Camino Del Sur. According to Plastino, Rizzo was found in possession of stolen property and attempted to hide some of his burglary tools upon being spotted by police. After examining the recovered stolen items, deputies determined that the two had targeted multiple areas with smash-and-grab auto burglary that night — including locations at 6512 Segovia, El Greco and Embarcadero Del Mar, as well as locations in Montecito.</p>\n<p>Plastino said the pair was right in the midst of their theft schemes when they were spotted by law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“[They] were in the process of looking for more cars to break into when they got caught,” Plastino said. “Both were on probation out of Ventura County for theft charge and are facing several charges in SB County,”</p>\n<p>The following night, on Friday, IVFP officers responded to another auto-theft incident.</p>\n<p>“An unknown suspect took the victim’s vehicle registration, insurance card, and FM transmitter from her unsecured vehicle that was parked in front of 6522 El Greco Road,” Plastino said.Sh</p>\n<p>Although one fingerprint was found and submitted to the County Forensics Department, no description of the suspect is available.</p>\n<p>Later that evening, in the early hours of Saturday morning, at around 1 a.m., deputies responded to a victim who reported being assaulted after trying to break up a fight on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>“A student was walking westbound on 6500 block Sabado Tarde and saw four men fighting. He attempted to break up the fight and while he was doing so, an unknown person punched him from behind. He lost consciousness and broke his jaw,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>The victim was immediately transported to the emergency room for treatment and surgery, according to Plastino, but he was unable to provide a description of the suspect.</p>\n<p>Plastino commented that, although the victim had positive intentions, witnesses should always first call 911 for help.</p>\n<p>That same evening, deputies responded to another assault incident on the 6700 block of Del Playa, Plastino said.</p>\n<p>“Deputies contacted the victim, who sustained a head injury as a result of the fight,” Plastino said. “Separately, deputies arrested the suspect in the nearby area. The suspect was identified by the victim as one of the people that had kicked him in the head.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, the suspect was booked for battery with serious bodily injury.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/","id":3785,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3784,3783,3782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Trump Declares State of Emergency in Calif., FEMA Will Fund Most Costs for Firefighting Efforts","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2017-12-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/US-101-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/US-101-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"FEMA will cover over 75 percent of firefighting costs in areas affected by the fire, according to Brandi Richard, FEMA spokesperson.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Donald J.

Officials also arrested two unrelated individuals for simultaneous incidents of shoplifting and battery, as reported by the owner of the 7-Eleven on Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Sheriff’s Lieutenant Robert Plastino, a strong-armed robbery occurred on El Greco Road at approximately 1:45 a.m. on Saturday. Plastino said the victim reports two males coming up to him on El Greco and hitting him repeatedly on the head.</p>\n<p>“He was knocked to the ground and when he asked what they wanted, they said ‘cash,’” Plastino said. “He gave them $40 from his wallet and the suspects fled toward UCSB.”</p>\n<p>The victim was not injured but was only able to give a limited description of his assailants, so police officers were unable to arrest anyone in connection with the incident. A UCSB emergency e-mail alert was sent to warn students of the incident and ask the public for further information.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at approximately 2:40 p.m. on Saturday, deputies intercepted and apprehended a suspected team of burglars, according to Plastino.</p>\n<p>“[California Highway Patrol] Officers observed a green GMC Envoy traveling northbound on Embarcadero Del Norte with one headlight out … and stopped the vehicle,” Plastino said. “IVFP deputies joined and contacted the people in the car.

The men were arrested and officers conducted a search on the car, which revealed several burglary tools including pry bars, cutting devices, flash lights, gloves and puncture tools. Officers also discovered a marijuana pipe, two methamphetamine pipes, a small supply of methamphetamine, three hypodermic syringes and Xanax.</p>\n<p>Plastino said officers recovered what appeared to be stolen goods, including eight cell phones and an Espana guitar in a black case that appeared to belong to an SBCC student.</p>\n<p>“All four men were arrested and charged with possession of burglary tools, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of hypodermic syringes, possession of prescripted meds without prescription [and] possession of stolen property,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, according to Plastino, deputies also arrested an intoxicated subject who was jumping on the rear trunk of a parked vehicle.</p>\n<p>“When I asked why he jumped on the vehicle, his response was, ‘Because I’m intoxicated and making bad choices,’” Plastino said. “The suspect had his older brother’s identification inside his wallet. When asked why he had his brother’s ID, the suspect responded, ‘to buy alcohol of course.’”</p>\n<p>Although Plastino said “the level of honesty was very rare,” the suspect was arrested for being drunk in public, minor in possession, causing damage to another’s vehicle and possession of someone else’s identification.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/","id":3787,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3786,3785,3784],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
