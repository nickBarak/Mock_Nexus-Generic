Coming into the match, the teams had split the last two matchups with UOP winning the last game in sudden death overtime. The win brought the Tigers’ record to 13-9.</p>\n<p>The game began with Pacific in front, as first up 2-0 and then 3-1. Santa Barbara came back to tie the game at 7-7 with a goal from senior utility Brendan McElroy with 4:36 left.</p>\n<p>The Tigers then got the tiebreaking goal from junior attacker Ikko Saito with 3:32 remaining in the game. The Gauchos had opportunities in the final minutes but could not convert as the Tigers won the game by one.</p>\n<p>Freshman attacker Shane Hauschild scored two goals to lead UCSB while UOP’s freshman attacker Devon Thumwood scored three goals for the Tigers. Junior attacker Kevin Cappon, junior 2-meter Samer Alkateb, junior 2-meter Liam Gaughan and junior attacker Ryan Baliani also scored goals for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Our six-on-five conversion rate was pretty low this weekend,” Racich said. “We were moving the ball around well but we just weren’t getting goals.”</p>\n<p>In its first match of the weekend, UCSB put up its worst defensive performance of the season, allowing 20 goals in a 20-10 loss at the hands of California. At the end of the weekend the Bears’ record was 20-4 after a loss to No. 5 Long Beach State on Sunday.</p>\n<p>It was a tale of two halves for the Gauchos as the teams entered halftime with the Bears up 6-5. Santa Barbara got goals from Hauschild and junior 2-meter Nicholas Jordan. Hauschild had two goals in the game and Jordan led the Gauchos with three goals.</p>\n<p>In the remaining 16 minutes of play, California scored 14 goals. Freshman attacker Luca Cupido led the charge with five goals while senior attacker Aleksa Saponjic and redshirt freshman attacker J.D. Ratchford added three goals each.</p>\n<p>“They have probably the best offense in the league,” Racich said. “We can’t just let them score like that.”</p>\n<p>The Bears scored the majority of their goals on the counter from mistakes by the Gauchos and physical play on their own part. The odd-man opportunities did not give junior goalie Chris Whitelegge much of a chance in front of his own net.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the rest of the season, the Gauchos have two remaining league matches against Pepperdine and UC Irvine before the MPSF tournament. Santa Barbara will hope to end its losing streak and get ready for the end of season tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts Pepperdine on Saturday at noon at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57827\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/water-polo-fails-to-get-off-the-mark-in-mpsf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57827\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/water-polo-fails-to-get-off-the-mark-in-mpsf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/water-polo-fails-to-get-off-the-mark-in-mpsf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/water-polo-fails-to-get-off-the-mark-in-mpsf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/water-polo-fails-to-get-off-the-mark-in-mpsf/","id":5338,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[5337,5336,5335],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss","biography":"Not available","articles":[172,174,176,177,187,188,193,195,197,198,212,213,214,216,233,235,412,525,725,748,779,801,804,2029,2038,3286,4901,5013,5026,5042,5063,5064,5068,5069,5101,5102,5103,5106,5124,5125,5126,5137,5141,5142,5143,5144,5145,5146,5147,5148,5149,5150,5183,5185,5186,5187,5190,5191,5310,5315,5318,5319,5320,5321,5322,5323,5338,5339,5341,5346],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Streak Ends at Seven","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MVBall-Mark-Brocher-DSC_5654.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MVBall-Mark-Brocher-DSC_5654.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"All good things must come to an end, and that was the case for the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team last night against No. 6 Cal Baptist.

From there on, the Lancers dominated the frame, scoring eight of the final nine points to steal the set.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist picked up where it left off from the first set and had an early advantage in the second game.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Gauchos mounted a comeback of their own and tied the frame at 18, despite trailing throughout. Just as in the previous set, Cal Baptist outlasted UCSB for a 26-24 win.</p>\n<p>The Lancer’s two Brazilian outside hitters, senior Levi Cabral and sophomore Guilherme Koepp combined for 24 kills as Cal Baptist won the third set 25-19 for the sweep.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist was extremely efficient on offense in its last two sets, hitting for an impressive .640 clip in the second set with 17 kills, followed by a .409 hitting percentage in the final set. The Gauchos did not help themselves either, committing 16 total errors in the game compared to just eight errors for the Lancers.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht had another big game for UCSB. Licht led all Gauchos in kills with 13, making it the sixth time in eight games he has lead the team in kills. Senior middle blocker Dylan Davis had a subpar night for his standards, hitting only .091 with five kills and two blocks.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have no time to dwell on the loss of the winning streak as it must prepare to face the top-ranked team in the nation on Friday in BYU.</p>\n<p>The Cougars enter as the only team as hot as the Gauchos before their loss against Cal Baptist. Brigham Young is currently on an 11-game winning streak and serves as a measuring stick for the Gauchos as the playoffs approach.</p>\n<p>“We know we can beat any team in our league, we proved it throughout our season,” Evans said. “We’re just going to have to take it to the teams.”</p>\n<p>In the previous match between the two teams, the Gauchos took the Cougars to the brink of defeat but were outlasted by BYU in the fifth set.</p>\n<p>In that game, four different Gauchos had double digit kills including senior outside hitter Miles Evans who had a career-high 21 kills. However, BYU’s junior outside hitter Taylor Sander had 20 kills, four digs and three blocks, which proved to be the difference in the game.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of confidence coming into the next match,” Evans said. “We know we can beat them and we really want to [win] so we can have a good chance for a good seed.”</p>\n<p>Besides serving as a measuring stick, Friday’s game against BYU will be critical in terms of seeding. The Gauchos are still in the hunt for the fourth seed in the playoffs which will grant them home court advantage. Santa Barbara has a 10-4 record at home but has struggled on the road, defeating only three conference opponents away from home and making the remaining games that more important.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are starting to feel the late season grind with only three games left in the regular season. UCSB was dealt with a devastating blow during last week’s trip to Hawaii. Evans suffered a high ankle sprain while playing against Hawaii when he stepped on sophomore middle blocker Jake Staahl’s foot.</p>\n<p>Ruled out by doctor’s for four to six weeks, the injury came as a surprise to Evans who might have played his last game as Gaucho. Evans will attempt to come back in three weeks, which will be put him on track to play in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against BYU is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 4th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50663\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50663\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/","id":5335,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5334,5333,5332],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to No. 1 BYU in Full Five Sets","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_009.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_009.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  In February, the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team lost against top-ranked BYU in Utah in five sets.

However, the Cougars responded in game two despite trailing by as many as five points in the set, mounting a comeback to win 25-20.</p>\n<p>Each team traded sets from there on, with the Gauchos winning the third set 25-18 and losing the fourth set 25-21.</p>\n<p>In the fifth set, UCSB found itself down 8-5 before switching sides of the court and going on a 7-2 run to take a 12-10 lead. Yet, BYU remained poised and won 15-13. It was UCSB’s fifth five-set loss of the season.</p>\n<p>“Typically fifth sets are a little more steady than that, but both teams gave up some runs,” McLaughlin said. “We got ourselves right back in it and we actually had the lead and probably the player of the year, [BYU outside hitter] Taylor Sander, made it when it counted. That guy came through. He was clutch; it all goes to him.”</p>\n<p>Freshman setter Jonah Seif was able to read the Cougar defense throughout the course of the match, setting up many opportunities for UCSB and recording 45 assists in the match. Santa Barbara was led by Licht, who had a career-high 21 kills to go along with four blocks and eight digs, making it the seventh time out of the past nine games he has led the Gauchos in kills.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos had 16 blocks and limited Brigham Young to just a .187 hitting percentage, Sander delivered a clutch performance and took over late in the game on his way to recording 18 kills and 11 digs. Freshman opposite Ben Patch was equally impressive with 19 kills.</p>\n<p>UCSB now gets ready to play against USC on Wednesday in its second-to-last game of the regular season at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 8th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Megali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/","id":5336,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5335,5334,5333],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Ready to Snap Two-Game Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_0072.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_0072.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With only two games left in the regular season, the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team plans to end the season strong and gain momentum for the playoffs when it plays USC tonight at the Thunderdome.

Although the team has lost consecutive games for the first time since February after Friday’s five-set loss to BYU, the Gauchos have still won seven of their last nine matches, including sweeping five of those opponents in three sets.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest thing is we’re not killing ourselves as much, we’re making teams play,” Licht said. “[Head Coach Rick McLaughlin] is giving us great scouting reports. When we get the ball we serve hard, we pass well, good things happened and it’s showed over the past few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, USC comes into the Thunderdome at 6-16 overall and in MPSF play, and are eliminated from postseason contention. In the last meeting between these two teams in Los Angeles, the Gauchos upset the Trojans 3-1, which marked the turning point in the season for the Gauchos as the team went on to win eight of the following nine games.</p>\n<p>“[USC is] going to be a lot better this time. They’re going to be hungry,” McLaughlin said. “Last time we were the ones who surprised them. They’re going to try to surprise us so we just got to be ready and play like the way we did [against BYU], and if we do that we’ll have a good chance.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Cristian Rivera will be the main threat likely to cause problems for Santa Barbara. In his last game against Cal State Northridge, Rivera had a team-high 18 kills and hit for an impressive .500 clip. This season, Rivera is third on the team with 147 kills so far.</p>\n<p>UCSB will still be without some of its key players tonight including senior outside hitter Miles Evans, whose presence was missed in Friday’s game versus BYU. Still, the Gauchos understand the importance of finishing the season strong as they prepare to play in the MPSF playoffs in two weeks.</p>\n<p>“We have to finish strong heading into the playoffs, we don’t want to go not playing our best,” McLaughlin said. “If we can play like we did [against BYU] I think we got a good shot at these next two opponents … That’s easier said than done.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match is scheduled for a 7 p.m. start in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Photo by Megali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50748\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50748\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/","id":5337,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5336,5335,5334],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
