Michael Crabtree started it. All season long, Crabtree has been talking about Sherman and about how overrated he is. He was never quite blatant about it, and most of his comments were said when few people were watching. He surely never said anything on the same stage that Sherman did. But he said it nonetheless, and it was a chip that Sherman carried on his shoulder all season long.</p>\n<p>Then after all that, Sherman still went to congratulate Crabtree on “a hell of a game”. After the final whistle, Sherman went to shake Crabtree’s hand, but his olive branch was met with a hand in the face. Crabtree might be more quiet and passive-aggressive about it, but the unsportsmanlike conduct went both ways and started with Crabtree’s “DeMarcus Cousins-esque” rejection of civility. Imagine what Crabtree would have said about Sherman if Crabtree wasn’t a loser this season.</p>\n<p>So after that, Sherman was a little fired up. He has just made the game-winning play, sending his beloved team to the Super Bowl. The adrenaline was still pumping, and Sherman’s eyes had a fierce, hungry look in them.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>He had just proved all his critics wrong, yet, again, but there was still unfinished business to attend to. He wanted it to be perfectly clear to the whole world that his Seahawks were not the underdogs against anyone, including the red-hot 49ers and the mighty Denver Broncos.</p>\n<p>Sherman has had to defy the odds and make his statement through actions his entire career. Crabtree was a first-round draft pick, Sherman was a fifth-round pick. Crabtree is making top-ten-pick money, while Sherman is making the league minimum.</p>\n<p>Crabtree is being labeled as having the best-hands of all-time, a distinction that completely disrespects previous 49er legends such as Jerry Rice, while Sherman was still an unknown entity to NFL fans even this season. Yet Sherman has been to multiple Pro Bowls and leads the best defense in the NFL, while Crabtree is just a good player on an average offense.</p>\n<p>Even Crabtree’s after-the-fact retort was weak. After the game and the interview, Crabtree tweeted “Film don’t lie. Show me the tape where the guy is the best.” Well Mike, we could show you that tape of the final play of the game a thousand times, and you still won’t get the picture. The fact that there is no other tape besides that play is a testament to the extent of which your quarterback fears Sherman Island.</p>\n<p>Which begs the question: Who do you want on your team? Seattle fans and Sherman’s teammates alike adore their star cornerback. He has demonstrated loyalty, intensity and excellence ever since he came to Seattle, and his trash talking is funny and endearing to everyone who isn’t on the receiving end of it. Pete Carroll approves of Sherman’s aura and believes it inspires the rest of the Legion of Boom.</p>\n<p>Sherman backs up his trash talk on the field and is a well-spoken, respectful, interesting dude off the field. I don’t think any “thugs”, as Niner fans refer to Sherman, have graduated from Stanford with a GPA hovering around 4.0.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that Sherman is the best cornerback in the game, and if his intensity and trash talking in the game are part of what makes him the best in the world, that’s just something fans must live with. The 12th man is behind Sherman every step of the way and love who he is on and off the field.</p>\n<p>While Sherman’s postgame interview might have been a little off-putting to some, it was an extreme and highly publicized moment. It was the culmination of years of adversity being overcome, expressed in the heat of the moment after a positive gesture was rejected. Crabtree needs to shut his mouth and hit the practice field if he wants to say anything about Sherman in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 29, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/richard-sherman-on-point-crabtree-a-sore-loser/","id":3250,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[3249,3248,3247],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco","biography":"Not available","articles":[597,2058,2084,2086,3196,3224,3228,3235,3239,3240,3242,3245,3250,3251,5105,5107,5108],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Term in Review: Student Advocate General Grecia Martinez","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GRECIA-MARTINEZ-–-Peyton-Stotelmyre.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GRECIA-MARTINEZ-–-Peyton-Stotelmyre.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Grecia Martinez overhauled many aspects of the OSA and made a lasting effect on the office, despite a lack of transparency at times in her term.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>The </em>Nexus<em> has compiled profiles of our current elected officials to reflect on their past year in office.

She said the physical space within Associated Students (A.S.) Main in the Multi-Cultural Center was in poor condition and lacked the supplies needed to do casework effectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coming in and realizing all of these things … the person who assumes this position has to really care about students and want to do it,” Martinez said in an interview with the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of immediately beginning the projects she planned for her term, Martinez said she first “had to take a huge step back” and “really pick apart the foundations” in order to improve the general functioning of the office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I settled into the position in the summer, that’s when I realized that this office needed to be number one, the foundation needed to be fixed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One fundamental part of this was rewriting A.S. Legal Code for the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) in order to better reflect the needs of students. Martinez said she changed the former divisions of casework within the office from Academic, Housing, Code of Conduct and Public Interest to consolidate some categories and create new divisions, which are now Grievances, Conduct and Academic and Financial Aid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this new organization of divisions fostered a more streamlined approach to case handling, in addition to making the process more intuitive for students.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rewriting Legal Code also included taking out the polling analyst project that was added the year before by Tannenbaum. Martinez said that the project’s execution did not reflect the initial vision or the needs of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In terms of the execution and the survey questions and everything, there wasn’t really anything there,” Martinez said. “Those questions that they had spent the whole year working on, I didn’t see how they would it would directly benefit this office.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her term, Martinez also began a project to create a database of past cases that were previously filed physically. Now, the office files all cases online, and the next S.A.G. will be able to use that database to observe patterns in the data of the cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez also helped to create a new logo for the OSA, which she said would help with outreach and better reflect the services of the office. She also noted that her office was more active on social media compared to her predecessor’s office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, Martinez did not have updated office hours for Spring Quarter 2019 available on the website, which she said was due to ongoing construction of the website. Office hours for Spring Quarter were also not readily available on the S.A.G.’s Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez collaborated with other UC campuses’ OSAs throughout the year to inform some of her projects for her term as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve done a lot of close communication to the other campuses and seeing how their student advocate offices work and what works well for them and what doesn’t.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, conversations with UC San Diego inspired Martinez to create an online appointment system for the office, similar to the one she had seen at their campus. The project is still in progress, but Martinez said she hopes it will make the office more accessible and user-friendly to students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez also helped lift a project off the ground that had been floating in the office for some time: moving OSA office to the Pardall Center in Isla Vista. The idea was something Robin Unander, the attorney for A.S., introduced to Martinez, and now something that Martinez hopes to pass on to the new S.A.G.-elect, Andrew Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The move aims to provide a more secure and confidential place for students to air their grievances, cases or concerns with OSA staff. Martinez’s case workers began holding office hours in the Pardall Center beginning in Spring Quarter 2019. The case workers from OSA literally worked alongside Undocumented Student Services and other legal services to create a more centralized space for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this quarter has focused on the logistics of moving the office, but she hopes that the OSA will be operating its services from the Pardall Center and the current space in A.S. Main will be used for administrative tasks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said a goal of hers for this year was to advocate for historically underrepresented and silenced students on campus. One way she addressed this was through her hiring decisions within the office. Martinez said she intentionally hired staff that came from different communities, clubs and cultural groups in order to better reach those people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In turn, Martinez said the staff in OSA created a more welcoming place for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The people who I hired in the office are definitely a lot more understanding of the students who come in and they know how to talk to them better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said her own background, as well as her work in various roles on campus, including as an A.S. senator in the 2017-2018 school year, helped her better understand students alongside her caseworkers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just know what it feels like to need help and not know where to go,” Martinez said. “Because of our background and experiences, I feel like a lot of people are more willing to go to great lengths to make sure that student is helped, that a student gets what they need.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said this aspect of her office is an improvement over Tannenbaum’s, citing that her office was more efficient in completing casework. Martinez said her office completed around 60 cases over the course of the year, but she noted that a lot of helping students involved giving guidance, talking things over and resolving problems that didn’t necessitate an officially documented case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez initiated significant projects during her term and followed through with a handful of the platform promises she made during her campaign. She had hoped to collaborate more with other groups on campus to specifically address student needs, but she said the conditions of the office that she inherited required more attention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Martinez at times failed to be completely transparent with the student body. Martinez <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/four-a-s-executives-over-last-5-years-were-not-enrolled-in-school-in-possible-violation-of-legal-code/\">withdrew from classes during Fall Quarter 2018</a>, but never came forward about withdrawing until after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported the withdrawal in Winter Quarter 2019. Concerns about Martinez’s eligibility for the position erupted soon after, but ultimately, A.S. Legal Code proved inconclusive on whether or not an A.S. executive could serve while not enrolled in classes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said her decision to withdraw was a hard one to make and that she withdrew on the final day of the quarter –– something Martinez said proves she was still a student and able to serve her constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not like I took a break from the quarter. It’s not like I was completely absent,” Martinez said. “I was still very much involved in everything and doing everything I had to do.”</span></p>\n<p>She later explained in a message that she initially withdrew because she “had experienced ongoing incidents of interpersonal violence… I was involved in circumstances prompting the involvement of CARE and Title IX.”</p>\n<p>“Working through the trauma and healing from the violence made focusing on academics nearly impossible.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, at the end of her term, Martinez wants to pass on her remaining projects to her successor and some advice, as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Have people who work in your office who care about students and that are represented in different communities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez echoes some of her previous goals for her term in her advice to Nguyen, but also encourages Nguyen to embrace that some of the best work is the work that sets up others to be successful as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like our whole office has done a lot of work to make sure that this office is successful in the long run and so I would just encourage Nguyen to kind of do the same.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, Martinez said the next S.A.G. needs to be dedicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just make sure that you really care about the work that you’re doing.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [5/20, 9:53 a.m.]: This article was updated to include further statements from Martinez regarding her withdrawal from Fall Quarter 2018. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The <em>Daily Nexus</em> Editorial Board wrote that Ho “fails to show professionalism” during Senate meetings, seemingly forgetting that  ”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.”</span></p>\n<p>While Ho has maintained a more professional decorum at more serious Senate meetings, such as last month’s divestment meeting, in some ways, he has continued to act unprofessionally throughout his term.</p>\n<p>Ho has been involved with A.S. for all three of his years at UC Santa Barbara, beginning as a fellow in the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office during the 2016-2017 school year before being elected as an on-campus senator for the 2017-2018 year.</p>\n<p>Two main platforms Ho emphasized during his term were expanding the A.S. Fellowship and making A.S. more visible to undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>“I think I was able to fulfill both, [but] not to the extent that I really hoped to do so,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>Ho cited deputy chief of staff resignations in both A.S. President Brooke Kopel’s office and his own, beginning the year in a scramble.</p>\n<p>“Because of academic reasons, the deputy chief of staff I had the vision with had to resign before the actual year started. So I had to try really quickly to hire a new one … so basically our hopes for it were not intermingling with the new people that were appointed,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>Ho said he took a more “proactive” role in attending meetings for various advisory boards that he said the IVP does not usually attend, including the UCEN Governance Board, A.S. Finance and Business Committee, Elections Committee and Student Fee Advisory Committee.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Legal Code, the IVP is required to attend meetings for the above listed committees, as well as the Calendar Committee, A.S. Commission on Public Safety, Transportation Alternatives Board, Parking Ratepayers Board and Tech and Media Services Committee, which Ho said he did not attend.</p>\n<p>Ho said he was “never contacted by the Calendar Committee,” “[didn’t] think [A.S. Commission on Public Safety] even had a chair this year,” didn’t know if Transportation Alternatives Board and Parking Ratepayers Board even existed and said the Tech and Media Services committee was “not existent this year.”</p>\n<p>Other responsibilities of the IVP, according to A.S. Legal Code, include ensuring honoraria is given to senators on time, ensuring a parliamentarian is hired for Senate proceedings and planning senator trainings during Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>While honoraria was issued on time during Fall Quarter 2018, the Honoraria Committee had problems meeting quorum, resulting in a late dispersal of honoraria during Winter Quarter 2019.</p>\n<p>After the A.S. Parliamentarian, Morales, resigned earlier this year, Ho could not find a replacement after multiple attempts.</p>\n<p>Ho did plan required trainings for senators on topics including anti-Semitism and sexual violence, but A.S. Legal Code states these trainings must be completed by week six of Fall Quarter 2018; Ho delayed them to the first week of Winter Quarter 2019, citing attendance issues.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to invite an external organization to come talk to less than half the Senate. I didn’t want to waste their time, I didn’t want to waste our time. So the first week of winter quarter seemed the most practical, because we got higher attendance when that happened,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>Through his work with certain committees, Ho worked alongside Finance and Business Chair Zion Solomon to extend more funding to various Boards, Commissions, and Units (BCUs).</p>\n<p>According to Ho, he and Solomon did an “excellent job” at reaching out to campus organizations to get funding through A.S.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s why we ran out of money so quickly in the year; it was really hard when you have to turn down some groups that wanted funding.”</p>\n<p>“Traditionally A.S. runs out of money week five, week six of Spring Quarter, this year it was around week three, week four that we ran out of money,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>“Other than allocating more money towards our OSL fund, and encouraging groups to go to BCUs for their funding sources [or] adjusting the A.S. Budget or maybe proposing a lock-in on top of what we already have for Finance and Business, there’s no other thing we can do.”</p>\n<p>Another goal Ho campaigned on as IVP was to make all Senate resolutions, bills, agendas and BCU minutes accessible on the A.S. website, but failed to do so due to an “outdated system.”<br>\n“The thing about editing the website, it’s super difficult because we run on an outdated system at Associated Students,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>“A lot of communication disparity happened within that and I just never got that finished.”</p>\n<p>Ho’s leadership style centered on fostering a collaborative environment for senators divided along party lines, and “[controlling] the room when it needed to be controlled.”</p>\n<p>“Obviously party politics played a huge role in this year’s Senate, even a bigger role than I’ve ever seen in my years in A.S.,” Ho said. “So [I kept] that atmosphere loose when I need to foster a collaborative environment, but if it did get hostile… [I would make] sure people aren’t out of order.”</p>\n<p>“If you met those senators, they definitely do not like each other.

The talented Seattle Seahawks cornerback has emerged as one of the most popular yet polarizing figures in the game of football thanks in large part to his postgame rant after the NFC Championship game. In case you need a refresher, Sherman yelled on camera, criticizing 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree and proclaiming himself the best cornerback in the game. Within minutes, Sherman was trending on Twitter, and he immediately became a national sensation.</p>\n<p>Sherman’s actions have received much criticism, both online and in the media, and rightfully so. His behavior showed poor sportsmanship and took away from what truly should have mattered — his teammates and the team victory. Instead, Sherman took the spotlight to belittle an opposing player who he had just trumped on national television, causing media and fans across the nation to focus more so on his antics rather than the Seahawks advancing to the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>But the way in which many have responded to Sherman is troubling and brings up an interesting and disturbing discussion. Many people, particularly online, resorted to calling Sherman a “thug,” a word with an extremely negative connotation. Is Sherman a loudmouth? Sure. Can he be described as cocky and at times arrogant? I wouldn’t argue against it. However, calling Sherman a thug and making him a villain out of a mishandled interview is certainly now way to him.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sherman came from the poor neighborhood of Compton, worked hard in high school to graduate as the Salutatorian with a 4.2 GPA and received a scholarship to play football at Stanford. Once at Stanford, Sherman continued to excel, graduating with a 3.9 GPA and a degree in Communication while balancing football and a spot in the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. He is also working towards a Master’s degree from Stanford.</p>\n<p>In addition to his academic excellence, Sherman is a generous and philanthropic man, often visiting underprivileged schools and providing students and athletes with the necessary resources that are often taken for granted in the classroom and on the field. Sherman even went as far as signing a contract with students, stipulating that if they were good students and members of the community, he would continue to provide them with classroom materials.</p>\n<p>A Stanford-educated man who has no criminal history and has shown a knack for helping children and the underprivileged certainly does not sound like a thug to me. Whether it is racism or even poor judgment and word choice on the behalf of critics, a thug is no way to describe Richard Sherman.</p>\n<p>His antics are over the top at times, but that, along with his talent on the field are what make him such a popular player. Sherman is the only defensive player in the top-10 of NFL jersey sales, and those numbers have skyrocketed in the past month.</p>\n<p>As far as his claim to be the best cornerback in the game — I’d have to agree with Sherman. The last two years he has been named All-Pro first team, registering eight interceptions in each season, a league high this year. In only three seasons of play, Sherman has registered 20 career interceptions. Not bad for a player who switched from wide receiver to cornerback in his final year at Stanford.</p>\n<p>A fifth round pick in the NFL draft by Seattle, Sherman has excelled in life every step of the way in the face of tremendous opposition. If you’ve ever heard him speak, aside from the notorious NFC Championship Game interview, you’d know Sherman is an intelligent and well-spoken man.</p>\n<p>Sherman’s actions have certainly garnered him more haters, but with that come more and more fans as well. When examining Sherman for the man he is on and off the field, and not only judging him on the one instance of poor behavior, it is hard to justify the hate. I am surprised to admit to myself that I am a Richard Sherman fan, something I never thought I’d say.</p>\n<p>You can be sure he’ll be in the spotlight come Sunday and all eyes will be on him and his actions during and after the game. Sherman is no villain, just a fiery competitor. Best of luck to you, Richard, this Super Bowl Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 29, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53757\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53757\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/","id":3249,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3248,3247,3246],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
