","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My sophomore year of college was the hardest year of my life. Following a surgery that left me in recovery for the better part of the summer, I returned to a campus that I had yet to find my place in for my second year. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked my way through roughly nine months of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) appointments, my idealism and romantic notions about college long forgotten. And yet, I found in myself a sense of strength and resilience forged from the hardships I had been forced to overcome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spending most of my time exploring Goleta and Santa Barbara by myself that year led not only to abundant self-reflection but also to an improved GPA as a result of focusing all my energy and frustration into my schoolwork. I didn’t realize until that following summer that I had improved enough to feasibly consider studying abroad for my final year, a dream I had long since abandoned as various factors seemed to work against me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My third year of college was significantly better, as I discovered my niche in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">office under Storke Tower and worked my way up to become the On the Menu editor. But after three years at UCSB, I had removed my rose-tinted glasses and realized that this school did not hold the same place in my heart that it did for so many others — and that despite having good friends, I needed to spend some time somewhere else.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Now, after months of paperwork and panicking about what I was about to embark on devoid of any safety net, I find myself reflecting on my experience thus far in my room at the University of Bristol, England. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until I was on the phone with my mom, talking about how much time had already passed, that I realized how unmistakably happy I was. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had come to England with the mindset that I would step fully out of my shell, challenging myself to overcome my social anxiety and make the most of my three months here. And somehow, that’s exactly what I did. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I talked to everyone I could and accepted as many invitations to go out as possible, spending very little time in my flat during those initial weeks. I was doing so well that after introducing my flatmate to my group of study abroad friends, she made a comment about how extraverted I seemed to be. For someone who had spent the majority of her college years in her room, it was a marker of just how far I had come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I owe a lot of my happiness here to my fellow UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) students, five of whom are possibly the greatest people I have ever met. Despite telling ourselves that we wouldn’t only hang out with other Americans, I still find myself spending most of my days with them. From impromptu pub crawls to week-long study sessions, I usually see them all at least once a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I write this, I just came back from a weekend spent in Dublin with fifteen other students, thanks to a large group chat that we somehow formed during our international orientation and kept expanding ever since. This Friday I leave for Edinburgh before setting off to Barcelona the next weekend and to London a few days after.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than spending all my time allowing my irrational brain’s constant fears and worries to stand in my way of doing things, I’m simply going out there and getting them done.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire experience seems so surreal; I had spent so long thinking that studying abroad was nothing more than a dream. If I was homesick in Santa Barbara, which was only a two-hour drive from my home in Huntington Park, how would I ever survive the over five-thousand-mile distance between home and Bristol? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most surprising thing about studying abroad has been the significant improvement to my mental health. Rather than spending all my time allowing my irrational brain’s constant fears and worries to stand in my way of doing things, I’m simply going out there and getting them done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the summer, right before I was supposed to leave, I hit a wall: my anxiety devolved into a case of a depression that made it hard to leave the bed sometimes. I was beginning to doubt my decision to go abroad without anyone I knew by my side. My family, while well-intentioned, simply encouraged me to look at things in a positive light, overlooking my sudden change in attitude as I counted down the days until my departing flight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But somehow, I made it to our London orientation in September with a clear mind and a resolve to put my best foot forward. I look at what I have accomplished in the almost two months I have been here and am surprised at how, despite missing home, I am not quite as desperate to return as I thought I would be going in.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany Velazquez wants you to take a chance on a fresh start by studying abroad. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/569616787b01b4ee0f29f140b8c9f662?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/569616787b01b4ee0f29f140b8c9f662?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tvelazquez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tiffany Velazquez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tiffany is the On The Menu Co-Editor and has been at the Nexus since spring of her freshman year.

Two bites into a baguette smeared with vegan cream cheese (what did I tell you?), the alarm bells started ringing. All the telltale signs were there: the itchiness on my tongue; the feeling of sand filling my throat as it constricts; my lips going pillowy with numbness; my swollen eyelids reducing my eyes to slits; and worst of all, the panic that sends adrenaline pinballing through my body, drumming up my heart rate and alighting every nerve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I checked the label on the container. Sure enough, the first ingredient listed was “RAW CASHEWS.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A moment of callousness and two bites of cream cheese. That’s all it took to launch my immune system into shutdown and my body into the bathroom, where I spent the next hour with my head in the toilet. This time I got lucky: With the aid of some Benadryl, my breathing returned to normal and the vomiting subsided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a thousand ways this situation could have played out, a thousand parallel universes determined by a single detail. What if I hadn’t been with friends who live minutes away from a drugstore? What if I’d been at a party surrounded by strangers? Or in a foreign country? What if my body went into </span><a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anaphylaxis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and I didn’t have my </span><a href=\"https://www.epipen.com/what-is-anaphylaxis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Epi-Pen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with me? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have experienced all of these scenarios in some form or another. From hives at holiday parties to barfing at the beach, I’ve seen it all. So it goes without saying that I am grateful my most recent reaction didn’t land me in the hospital, or worse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, a tiny, irrational part of me wishes it did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes, there is a disparity — a chasm, really — between the emotional and physical scars left by a traumatic event. Each time, my body outpaces my mind in the recovery process; my eyes de-puff before my tears dry. My allergy is life-threatening, meaning that every time I have a reaction, I am faced with the possibility of my own death.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That such a serious medical condition is called an “allergy” strikes me as wildly inappropriate. “Allergy” is a silly word that conjures up images of snot-nosed kids and springtime pollen. It undercuts the terror that seizes me when I realize that something tastes “off.” It makes it difficult for others to empathize with my experiences. No, I don’t live with chronic pain or have to inject myself with medicine on a daily basis. Yes, I am otherwise healthy and able-bodied. But when you live your whole life thinking you could die at any meal, it takes an emotional toll.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Countless times, I had wondered what my life would be like without my allergy; never had I wondered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would I be without it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this reason, the more drastic the reaction, the easier it is to cope with it. In the wake of a reaction fraught with dramatic details — pastries, Greece, family vacation, deserted island, paramedic tent, no Epi-Pen — I received an outpouring of sympathy from my friends and family. The intensity of their concern matched the misery of the experience. However, this was an exception, not the rule. Reactions that occur under ordinary circumstances, such as Sunday brunch, don’t elicit the same response even though they are no less terrifying for me. This can be extremely isolating, to say the least.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feeling of being heard but not understood makes me want to exaggerate the details of my reactions the way I sometimes embellish stories, a trait at which my friends and family often poke fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was struck by this as I lay in bed after the Bad Brunch, snapping me out of my post-reaction slump. Countless times, I had wondered what my life would be like without my allergy; never had I wondered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would I be without it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My allergy and I have been attached since birth, our fates tied together by the pad thai noodles that sent me to the hospital at age one. I can’t remember living without it, and </span><a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/peanut-allergy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data indicates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that I probably never will. Which means that for better or worse, my nut allergy is woven into the fabric of my being. If personalities are like smoothies — a random blend of family, culture, DNA and environment — who’s to say it wasn’t a formative ingredient? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some manifestations are positive, highlighting aspects of my personality that may have otherwise remained in the shadows. I was always a precocious child, the kind that enjoyed talking to adults and hogged the camera in all the home videos. Yet my engraved emergency bracelet was my first real taste of the spotlight. I would shake my chubby fist at anyone who would listen, reveling in the attention it garnered me. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually I graduated from bracelet-waving to bragging, as if being in constant latent danger was cool. I feel lucky for myself and my parents that I was such an obnoxious kid, never hesitating to announce my allergy to anyone offering me food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also credit my allergy for my Doomsday Prepper tendencies. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have to carry a chunky plastic medicine stick and 1-2 tablets of Benadryl with you everywhere, you become one of those people who anticipates disaster at every turn. I have since blossomed into a one-woman drugstore, never without band-aids, floss, tampons or gum on hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up with a severe allergy also prematurely exposed me to some dark truths. The most heartbreaking lesson of childhood is that your parents can’t protect you from everything</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I learned this early on. Proactive and careful as they were, my parents couldn’t be there every time there was an incident. In fact, they were the accidental perpetrators of a few reactions. To chalk up my neuroses and distrust of adults to a nut allergy might seem, well, nuts, but it can’t be dismissed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would I wish a fatal food allergy on anyone else? No. Can I imagine my life without it? Strangely, also no.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s part of who I am, for better or worse. The disadvantages of a fatal allergy are obvious.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They read like the side effects delivered in hyperspeed at the end of a commercial: nausea, vomiting, swelling, redness, anaphylaxis, death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the upsides? I am long past the point of considering attention one of them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o amount of pity or compassion can counteract the trauma or resulting isolation. Moreover, I do not subscribe to the “everything happens for a reason” theory </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s disrespectful toward the victims of senseless tragedies and frankly, it’s bullshit. Some clouds are gray without a touch of silver. Some lemons are just meant to be lemons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet despite the drawbacks, having a severe allergy has gifted me with an alternative perspective on my own life. Along with all of the other timelines by which we organize our lives </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relationships, family pets, schools, career milestones </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exists my personal history of reactions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The details surrounding these incidents are forever vivid in my mind: the holiday decor at the Christmas Party where I ate white chocolate walnut fudge at age nine; the sunlight and rolling green hills at my second grade field trip, crumbs glinting off the knife that had been used to cut a peanut butter cookie moments before; the security of my mom’s hand around mine when she picked me up from kindergarten after a classmate’s birthday cake made me sick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While allergic reactions make for unpleasant memories, they go hand in hand with special moments that I wouldn’t recall otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is, however, one definitive benefit of having a deathly allergy: It gives people a way to show that they care about you. There’s a line in “Lady Bird” that goes, “Don’t you think they’re the same thing? Love and attention?” In this case, I think they are. Considering how nuts are exceedingly normal and harmless for about 95% of the population, a person needs a reason to care about their presence. I am that reason for my loved ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time someone takes extra precautions to ensure my safety, I feel like they’ve just handed me a present. Like when my friend Samantha insists on asking the waiter if the pizza we ordered has nuts, even though I’ve read the menu twice and pizza never has nuts, idiot. Or when my aunt Millie hands me the bowl of sweet potatoes that she personally prepares for me every Thanksgiving. It’s not just that my people look out for me; it’s that I never have to ask. They’ve already thought of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the time, living with this condition is perfectly manageable. Unlike many people, I’m fortunate to have a support system that includes access to medical treatment in case of an emergency. As of this moment, no cure has been found, though I’m sure it won’t be long now (and when it is, it’ll probably be </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-mylan-epipen-drug-prices-20180605-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outrageously expensive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would I wish a fatal food allergy on anyone else? No. Can I imagine my life without it? Strangely, also no.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was writing this, I got a text from Aunt Millie. “Can you eat sunflower seeds?” she wanted to know. “We’re going to make an appetizer for Passover with sunflower seeds in place of walnuts.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harper Lambert has never tasted Nutella, and she is not sad about it.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_7283.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/harper-lambert/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Harper Lambert</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Harper Lambert is the editor-in-chief for the 2020-2021 school year.

I was late again, of course. I was trying to pass a sad and slow beach cruiser when I noticed a speedy road bike attempting to do the very same. He went to shoot the gap between me and the cruiser, and in doing so, pushed me into the oncoming bike traffic. In what felt like a single heartbeat, I was on the floor, my bike was on top of me, my phone was thrown across the path and my legs were covered in blood. I was left with was a splitting pain between my ears. At the moment, I had no idea why. Within seconds, I was surrounded by five kind strangers who were eager to help me get up and out of harm’s way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hadn’t realized yet just how hurt I was. I sat under a tree with my face in my hands, utterly embarrassed that everyone had just seen me wipe out. A nice man asked if I was okay since he apparently saw me hit my head on the ground. I tried telling him that I didn’t hit my head at all. He pressed on my temple to show me I was wrong. That’s when I knew I needed to get some real help.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88567\" style=\"width: 503px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88567\" data-attachment-id=\"88567\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/concussion/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/concussion-e1558635814124.jpg?fit=650%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"concussion\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/concussion-e1558635814124.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/concussion-e1558635814124.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-88567\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/concussion-e1558635814124.jpg?resize=493%2C370\" alt=\"\" width=\"493\" height=\"370\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88567\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I limped my way over to Student Health, dragging my death trap of a bicycle behind me.

This was the second brain injury I received at UCSB and I was most likely going to miss the rest of the soccer season. The way I saw it, my life was over. The thing about concussions is that you can only really understand what it feels like if you’ve had one before. Empathy is not possible. It is not just a bad headache that won’t go away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on who you are and which part of the brain you have injured, your symptoms will be vastly different. People who </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786154/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">injure their prefrontal lobe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are likely to experience a personality shift as well as disassociation with the mind and body. When I fell off my bike, I hit my left temple on the pavement, inflaming my temporal lobe. This segment of the brain controls and regulates your emotions, language comprehension and auditory perception. Because of this, I was in a bitchy mood, sucked in Spanish class and had the hearing capacity of my 85-year-old grandpa. That month was devastating — and yet, thanks to the fog, feels as though it never happened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When my friends and family ask what a concussion feels like, I freeze. There are no words with which you can articulate it. You just hope and pray they never have to experience it firsthand. The best way to describe the period of concussion is like you’re living in a fog. This fog is plagued by clouds of migraines, introspective thoughts and fears that you will never make it out. Sadly, </span><a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-dangers-of-ignoring-concussions/article17992226/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some people do not recover from a concussion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, especially if they suffer three or more in their pre-adult lives. I was one of the lucky ones.  My teammate Kayla has received five major concussions and seriously believes she is a different person because of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is recognizing this shift in personality that causes people to become depressed. They daydream about how they used to act, think, speak and even walk. Day by day, their past selves becomes more and more a stranger to them. I myself felt this depression. Even though this was difficult to go through, the fog had its upsides as well. I even grew to know my best friend better.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing about concussions is that you can only really understand what it feels like if you’ve had one before.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My best friend was diagnosed with clinical depression when she was 12 years old. Every year, her condition became more and more apparent. She saw a therapist twice a week and took three forms of medication daily. As her best friend, I was there for her whenever she needed me — whether this meant providing her a home to escape to, a shoulder to cry on or even an ear when she felt she could not trust her doctor. Slowly throughout the course of high school, I became her therapist. The pay wasn’t great, but it felt nice to help her out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always wished I could do more. I could only sympathize with what she was going through. I had never been depressed before, so of course, I couldn’t really know what was going on in her head. At lunch, I would research WebMD articles on depression and anxiety, hoping to get her answers and hoping to be a better therapist. I now realize this issue applies to concussions as well. You don’t really know what people are going through unless you’ve been there yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I continued to be there for Bella, even when we left to attend different universities. I became a long-distance therapist. We would FaceTime roughly five times a week, hoping to ease her nerves as she settled into her new life at the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Colorado, Boulder</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For the first time, we were in different states. For the first time, a phone call was my only way to comfort her. For the first time, I could not be there for her to the best of my ability. This ate at me. I was constantly worried about her. If I had not heard from her in two days, I knew something was wrong. She needed her therapist, but I was off dancing down Del Playa and tanning on the Anacapa lawn. I felt guilty. I had it so easy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My world came to a halt when I got my concussion. I was unable to do anything on my own for over a month and my GPA suffered tremendously. I became socially awkward, I lost my sense of adventure, I became introverted and I even forgot what it felt like to feel excited. My world was gray. I learned to exist, rather than to live. But above all else, I began to understand what Bella was going through. For the first time, I did not feel like her therapist. Finally, I could hear her out and understand it completely. For years she had been trying to help me see what it was like to live in a world of gray. Now I knew. So yeah, getting pushed off by bike really sucked — but it allowed me to see my friend and her condition in a whole new light. In a weird way, it felt like we were depressed together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point in our lives, we are bound to feel trapped by the gray and to feel lost in amongst the dreary clouds. I would not have gotten through my concussion if it weren’t for the love and support of those around me. It just goes to show that even on the darkest of days, someone else’s light can burn through your clouds, brighten the gray and clear your fog. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Peck encourages Gauchos to care for their concussed friends. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88566\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88566\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-26/living-in-a-fog/","id":5664,"author":{"id":375,"name":"Hannah Peck"},"related":[5663,5662,5661],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Island In The Sun","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Global Gauchos","publish_date":"2019-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calista-island-in-the-sun-art-e1548201389877.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Calista-island-in-the-sun-art-e1548201389877.jpg?resize=650%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Calista Liu espouses the benefits of studying abroad in Cyprus.

Although I had been eagerly awaiting the adventure since I sent in my application to study abroad, I have to admit that spending my birthday without my friends and family hit harder than I thought it would. As someone with minimal international travel experience, navigating major airports and traveling out of the country solo equated to a great deal of confusion, stress and, at times, tears — sometimes all three at once! However, two layovers and a panicked moment of thinking I’d lost my carry-on in Switzerland later, I had arrived at my final destination: a small island in the Mediterranean Sea.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve never heard of the country of Cyprus before, don’t worry — I hadn’t either. Last fall, as I looked through the different study abroad programs available, my decision-making process could be summarized as follows: What is Cyprus? Is this… a country? It’s on the EAP website, so it has to be a country. Probably. Where is it? Oh, Google says it’s an island in the Mediterranean Sea. Sweet, I’m going.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to hearing of my study abroad destination for the upcoming fall, most family and friends replied with either, “Cyprus?

To put it into perspective, Cyprus is approximately 9,251 square kilometers with a population of about 1 million people, while the United States is approximately 9,833,517 square kilometers with about 323 million more people. However, despite its small size, the country has managed to fill itself with a wide variety of impressive sites and excursions. From exploring the sea caves and cliff jumping at Cape Greco in Ayia Napa to hiking in the Troodos Mountains and seeing small patches of snow, I’ve only just begun to describe the range of activities that can be found on the island. When you have a moment, feel free to Google “Blue Lagoon” in Cyprus. Yes, that’s real. And yes, it’s even more stunning in person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Cyprus is more than just a pretty place. Located at the maritime crossroad of three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa), the small island has a robust history spanning 10,000 years. Throughout its existence, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Lusignans, Genoese, Venetians, Ottomans, Britons and Turks have all sought to take the island for themselves. Currently, Cyprus remains divided with the northern third run by a Turkish Cypriot government and the southern two-thirds run by the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot government. In order to visit Northern Cyprus, I had to cross a border with my passport.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, more surprising than the realization that I had moved to a divided country was how quickly this little country became home for me. Despite not speaking a word of Greek, or even knowing substantial information about the country upon arrival, the culture shock I’d anticipated was pretty much nonexistent. Honestly, I kind of relate to the Cypriots’ horrendous parking skills. When I think about the fact that the biggest obstacle I’ve faced so far has been trying to explain what tofu was to the employees at the grocery store, I become aware of just how lucky I am to have stumbled upon this island. Sometimes, I can’t believe that two months have passed by already. I really don’t want to think about how I’ll have to leave my new home in just one month.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More surprising than the realization that I had moved to a divided country was how quickly this little country became home for me.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of where you decide to study abroad (if you have the opportunity to do it, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do it</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), finding your new family will undoubtedly be the best part. There are truly no other people I would rather sprint through both the Frankfurt train station and airport with in order to make our flight or sit through a cold and drizzly six-hour ferry ride from Athens to Naxos with. If you somehow have the fortune to find the right group of people to create a family dinner rotation, to be your travel buddies, to be the reason why a foreign country can somehow be called home, then you’ll understand why I hold this small island so close to my heart. There’s a reason why they say that home isn’t a place, it’s a person — or, in this case, ten people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though some loved ones still send me messages asking, “How is Cypress?” the country’s anonymity only adds to its charm. I’ll miss everything this underrated country has to offer: from the spinach and feta cheese pies to the sweet dog I pass by every day on my way to campus to the memories that will truly last a lifetime. My biggest takeaway from studying abroad is that with an open mind and an open heart, anywhere in the world can become home.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calista Liu encourages students to consider studying abroad somewhere unorthodox. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.
