President and Morse for A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) under the FTP platform, and both will make an official announcement at the Declaration of Candidacy meeting on March 5. The idea for FTP, which will be the first new party formed since 2010, came from a campus club Morse began in Fall 2013 while a student at Santa Barbara City College (SBCC).</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, FTP aims to preserve the freedoms of individual students.</p>\n<p>“We’re about preserving the basic rights of the students, allowing people who are doing their own thing, minding their own business, to live life,” Garshfield said.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said a major component of the FTP platform will be trimming down the A.S. budget to focus on essential services, stating that the library is an example of misaligned budgetary priorities.</p>\n<p>“It’s going through this three-year renovation and that’s going to be going on almost until I graduate,” Garshfield said. “Before either using taxpayer dollars or student funds on these grand projects, we should be focusing on preserving the rights of the students, and that’s what we’re about.”</p>\n<p>Morse said A.S. should not impose funds through lock-in fees, especially considering the low election turnout during fee initiative elections. According to him, FTP will instead give students the option to pay for activities and services separately.</p>\n<p>“You’re voting with your dollar at that point,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Official People’s Party (OPP) Chair and fourth-year political science major Elijah Ettenger said in a statement that eliminating lock-in fees is not the solution to increase fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<p>“We feel the solution is instead to have a more strict process for the enactment of new lock-in fees so that only the most critical are approved,” Ettenger said.</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, one of FTP’s main concerns is “police occupation” in Isla Vista, and he criticized OPP for not addressing this alleged issue.</p>\n<p>“We’re very concerned about the police occupation,” Garshfield said. “The fact that our only elected representatives haven’t been dealing with it is something we definitely feel needs to be corrected.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said while he believes FTP’s goal to address police behavior will be “fairly noncontroversial” among students, the party’s views on how to address the issue may face opposition.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the students are fed up with the police presence,” Garshfield said. “So that at least is something a lot of students will get behind. What I think might be controversial is that we’re willing to choose freedom over safety … There are some people who believe that without the increased police presence, we are not going to be able to maintain order.”</p>\n<p>Morse said A.S. should view police relations through a framework of “community-based solutions.”</p>\n<p>“I think that there are definitely ways that we can self-regulate,” Morse said, “We don’t need this sort of martial law.”</p>\n<p>According to Ettenger however, OPP has already taken steps toward improving community and police relations.</p>\n<p>“In order to achieve this we must first bring everyone to the table,” Ettenger stated. “OPP has already begun this process by organizing programs such as Pizza with Police and Coffee with the Cops.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Foot Patrol Lieutenant Robert Plastino said he agrees that there needs to be increased efforts made to improve police relations with the student community.</p>\n<p>“Positions like a Community Resource Deputy are sorely needed in Isla Vista, yet budget and staffing issues prevent such outreach,” Plastino said in an email.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said the process he underwent to register FTP as an official party was unnecessarily complicated and could potentially discourage other student political participation.</p>\n<p>“There’s also this very complex set of rules and regulations, and I think a lot of it is designed to stop ordinary students from getting involved,” Garshfield said. “That’s something that’s concerning to me and I’d like to see the elections code made … a little simpler for students to get involved with.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science, black studies major and former Democratic Process (DP) party candidate Mohsin Mirza said he agrees the process involves many barriers. According to him, the DP party has not announced any candidates for the upcoming election.</p>\n<p>“The process is difficult, but more than just rules and regulations,” Mirza said. “If you don’t have the money, if you don’t have the time, if you’re a working-class student — it’s very difficult to be in those positions.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Chair and second-year political science major Fiona Hayman however said starting a political party is a very accessible process for students.</p>\n<p>“Anyone can start their own party if they fill out the necessary form and appoint a party liaison, who will be the point of communication between the party and the Elections Committee,” Hayman said. “I see this as beneficial for the UCSB community, as the accessibility of the processes of forming a party and running for office is essential to the efficacy of democracy.</p>\n<p>Morse said he and Garshfield decided to register a party for this spring’s election in part to ensure there is a party to compete against OPP.</p>\n<p>“It seems like the OPP party is the only one that is running, so we thought that it was important just to have a competition of different ideas,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he is worried OPP is gaining complete control of the campus’ political conversations.</p>\n<p>“Over time, I’m worried that it will become more and more of a political machine that simply turns out candidates for the sake of winning,” Garshfield said. “Someone needs to challenge the status quo, and we were the ones to stand up and do it.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, multi-sided political party competition is important to represent the variety of student voices that exist on campus.</p>\n<p>“I believe we need to have multiple parties,” Mirza said. “The fact that there’s just two parties I think is a failure, because I think students think in more than two different ways.”</p>\n<p>But Ettenger said OPP is committed to representing each and every student on campus.</p>\n<p>“Every year our party brings together a diversified group of students that provide a consistent influx of new and innovative ideas to best represent all students,” Ettenger said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to Morse, FTP has gathered support and would like to run more candidates in the upcoming A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“We’ve found some other people who are interested in running with us,” Morse said. “Generally, we have gained a lot of support.”</p>\n<p>Morse said while FTP’s conservative ideas may face challenges, he hopes the party will be seen as a vehicle for representing common student interests.</p>\n<p>“The Free Thinking Patriots is not about representing one party as a whole,” Morse said. “Its specific mandate is to rise above that and come up with common ground solutions.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, the rising cost of education makes collective funding for student groups vital in order to ensure student empowerment and diversity.</p>\n<p>“At a time when education is so expensive, we need well-funded organizations advocating for us,” Mirza said. “The idea of having students pay for things themselves, out of pocket, undermines the idea that we are stronger when we act together and pull all our resources together.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he runs the A.S. Lobby Corps, which uses A.S. funding to take students to Sacramento to meet with California legislators and lobby on student-related issue like affordability of education. Mirza said he thus feels A.S. funding for particular student activities is important.</p>\n<p>“That money is used for very important things that help students,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Mirza also said the A.S. budget could be made more efficient without having to reduce collective student funding.</p>\n<p>“Do I think that we could be doing more with the resources we have? Yes,” Mirza said. “But I think it’s absurd to say the solution is to weaken our own power by taking away our ability to fund ourselves and our projects.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, although he does not “think that it’s a secret that [he is] a conservative,” he said he hopes FTP will be seen as a vehicle for representing common student interests, not as a platform for his and Garshfield’s politics.</p>\n<p>“The Free Thinking Patriots is not about representing one party as a whole,” Morse said. “Its specific mandate is to rise above that and come up with common ground solutions.”</p>\n<p>While Garshfield called FTP an “underdog,” he said believes in its ideals and is ready to compete with OPP.</p>\n<p>“If I didn’t believe in shooting high I wouldn’t be doing this,” Garshfield said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61277\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/students-form-new-campus-party/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61277\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/students-form-new-campus-party/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/students-form-new-campus-party/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/students-form-new-campus-party/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/students-form-new-campus-party/","id":2888,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2887,2886,2885],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens","biography":"Not available","articles":[2548,2678,2698,2739,2747,2752,2759,2783,2814,2818,2875,2876,2877,2888,2903,2932,3442,4662,4698,4703,4726,4754,4755,4764,4779,4805],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

The Student Affairs Committee also listened to reports from the Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC) about a bill to create the Code of Conduct for Associated Students.</p>\n<p>The SFAC chair and fourth-year economics and accounting major Sean McKenzie said their group is separate from A.S. and is composed of 12 voting members, including two sophomores, two juniors, two seniors, two grad reps, two faculty and two staff representatives.</p>\n<p>“We are a committee under the Student Affairs Department, so we have nothing to do with Associated Students at all, even though we have Associated Students as our Ex-Officio Advisory members,” McKenzie said.</p>\n<p>According to McKenzie, the SFAC hears out public requests for departments for one-time projects such as maintenance requests, student health requests and more.</p>\n<p>“In Fall we open up public requests for those departments like the MultiCultural Center, the Rec Center, CAPS — there’s a whole list on our website actually,” McKenzie said. “So they come in [and] in the Fall they request money from us. We have a pot every year of money — it’s $285,000 each year, that’s based on a percentage of the student services fee. So based on that money, the Committee will allocate to these departments based on if they see fit whether they are going to improve the student life basically.”</p>\n<p>McKenzie also said all UC’s have a SFAC, and they meet up at various locations every quarter to work on campaigns.</p>\n<p>The Chair of the Senate Affairs Committee and second-year political science major Cassandra Mancini said SHAC had a meeting last Tuesday discussing the new meningitis vaccine, which would require three shots.</p>\n<p>“Last year, 50 percent of the student body got both shots, so that’s pretty cool. We’re very protected against Meningitis,” Mancini said. “But this new vaccine is not recommended — or you don’t have to get it if you got last year’s one — but, it would be good for new students and transfer students to get. So we will be offering that.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the new vaccine will cost money, but the amount is currently unknown.</p>\n<p>“It’ll just be in the Student Health Office, so anyone can get it at any time — it’s also not free like it was last year,” Mancini said. “They didn’t mention how much it costs. But also, I don’t know if insurance will cover it until next year, so that’s something that we might have to start talking about pretty soon.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the cost of getting the flu shot is rising, and there will be an official meeting on Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) next Thursday.</p>\n<p>“The costs of flu shots is being increased from $20-$30 for non-Gaucho Health Insurance people, and we talked about whether that was prohibitive or not,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>Mancini said the distance criteria will be extended to approximately 50 miles next year in order to include students who have Kaiser health insurance, which is currently not a sufficient alternative health care providers according to current GHI stantards, though MediCal students would still be denied.</p>\n<p>“Kaiser students can easily get waived,” Mancini said. “So that will be great for students because that was a big issue this year. Us and Santa Cruz are the only UC’s that didn’t have a Kaiser within a close distance.”</p>\n<p>FEC student representative and fourth year student Nikka Kurland said the Faculty Committee’s responsibilities include collecting information from end-of-the-quarter course assessments.</p>\n<p>“They review self-assessments from different departments and kind of like approve name changes [of] the department names like changes of majors and things like that,” Kurland said. “All the little surveys that you guys fill out at the end of each quarter,  like ranking the classes and stuff, basically that information does get compiled and people actually do look at it, and people actually take it very, very seriously.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator Matthew Santos presented an amendment to add a second policy called “A Bill to Create the Code of Conduct for Associated Students” on to policy one in the A.S. Senate Bill.</p>\n<p>“Policy one would be created as the actual code of conduct with the A.S., all elected officials and the five bullets underneath,” Santos said. “The amendment that I would propose creates policy two under that.”</p>\n<p>Mancini said the Code of Conduct had previously been voted on and approved by the Senate, but that the second policy in need of approval included the travel agreement under the five points for elected officials, appointed officials, general members and employees of A.S.</p>\n<p>According to Santos, the agreement would promote “professionalism, civility, respect and courtesy.”</p>\n<p>“We would just call that the A.S. Code of Conduct Travel Agreement… voted upon by the Senate, specific for traveling to events,” Santos said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Brock/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara psychologist and author Larry Decker gave a lecture on his recently released book <em>The Alchemy of Combat: Transforming Trauma in Combat Veterans</em> exploring post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans at Mosher Alumni Hall on Wednesday evening.</p>\n<p>The event was organized by the university’s Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS) and the Veteran Resource Center. During the presentation, Decker discussed various topics regarding PTSD, including the historical origins of the disorder, how combat affects soldiers, the difficulties soldiers face adjusting to life after duty and various PTSD treatments. During his talk, Decker, who has experience treating veterans from every war from WWII to Afghanistan, shared stories of individuals he had met and treated.</p>\n<p>Noting that he himself was not a veteran, Decker said civilians do not fully understand the extent of the psychological challenges veterans face.</p>\n<p>“[As] civilians, we’re so stupid, we don’t understand,” Decker said. “We don’t really want to understand. Civilians for the most part don’t want to know and they don’t really care. All we want is for you guys to just keep it to yourself, get over yourself, get on with your life.”</p>\n<p>Decker also said he has encountered many young veterans from Iraq who have expressed a desire to return to military life after service due to dissatisfaction with the banality of civilian life.</p>\n<p>“Think about it: in Iraq you’re armed to the teeth, you’ve got the power of life and death, the lives of your fellow men, fellow soldiers is in your hands. What could be more important, more meaningful?” Decker said. “Then you come back here. What do you have here? It’s an enormous statement about the meaningfulness of our culture.”</p>\n<p>Army veteran, Veterans and Military Services Coordinator and overseer of the Veterans Resource Center Kevin Hagedorn said services on campus seek to provide support for student veterans who are making the transition from service to college life.</p>\n<p>“As soon as we identify student veterans who are applying to UCSB, we make contact with them and try to help and facilitate their entry into UCSB,” Hagedorn said. “To getting admitted, to enrolling in classes, getting their GI Bill benefits and setting foot on campus.”</p>\n<p>Assistant Clinical Director at CAPS Kirsten Olson said there are many outreach programs for student veterans on campus to help with issues such as stress management.</p>\n<p>“We have staff psychologists who work with veterans,” Olson said. “They are welcome in our clinic and offer individual and group counseling. I work very closely with Kevin and our Veterans Resource Center to offer workshops for things like stress management, sleep habits and transitions to college.”</p>\n<p>Hagedorn said he had difficulties connecting with traditional students on campus after transitioning from military life to college life at CSU Chico after nine years of service in the army.</p>\n<p>“A lot of veterans are what we call non-traditional students, so they aren’t in the same pipeline as a lot of our students. Most of them are transferring from community colleges or they may have done school while they were in the military,” Hagedorn said. “When they come here to UCSB, they aren’t in the same loop that most of our students are. We want to make sure they get plugged into resources like CAPS, Disability Services, tutoring and career services.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

director at the American Task Force on Palestine Ghaith al-Omari presented a lecture in Campbell Hall about U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>The talk, titled “U.S. Foreign Policy and the Chaotic Middle East,” traced the history of U.S. and Middle Eastern foreign policies from the Iran war in the 1980s to modern conflicts with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a Sunni fundamentalist group controlling large portions of Northern Iraq. The speakers made points explaining how America has negatively influenced the current state of the Middle East, education in the Middle East and ways to prevent youth from joining ISIL.</p>\n<p>Ginsberg said American policy makers need to take accountability for their mistakes interfering in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“I want to see more American policy makers say that they were dead wrong,” Ginsberg said. “We’ve invested so much with [former Iraqi] Prime Minister al-Maliki. Remember President Obama’s goals, noble goals — we want to get out of Iraq. And yet we turned the keys to a prime minister that was determined to exacerbate the Sunnis, persecute Sunnis as a result of Saddam Hussein and recreate himself as a proxy puppet for the Iranian Wars.”</p>\n<p>According to Ginsberg, the U.S. may not be entirely at fault for the current status of the region but still needs to take responsibility for contributing to the disorder in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“Let’s be very clear here,” Ginsberg said. “The Middle East is a mess. It’s a jungle out there. If we don’t understand when we need to jump into the trees when the elephants are trampling through the jungle in the forest, we have no one to blame but ourselves.”</p>\n<p>Al-Omari said although the U.S. should be held liable, the lack of structure in the Middle East also took part in the rise of disorder.</p>\n<p>“First of all, it is not the U.S.’ fault that these things happen,” al-Omari said. “We have diplomats and intelligence and people on the ground. Of course they know about religion. But we don’t have structures. There’s a bankruptcy of many ideologists of the ’60s faded when Iraq turned into a dictatorship under the guise of pro-western liberals who never really tried to engage. Between Islam and the Iraq revolution, it was only natural Islam would come in and take part.”</p>\n<p>According to Ginsberg, the Obama Administration is not qualified to successfully create effective foreign policy in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“I believe foreign policy is made by people sometimes with good intentions and sometimes by people with good intentions who make mistakes,” Ginsberg said. “My biggest gripe with the Obama’s administration Middle East Policy is that there’s absolutely no one who’s been given authority in this White House who’s been in the Middle East more than two weeks of their lives.”</p>\n<p>Ginsberg said the creation of ISIL can, to a large extent, be directly attributed to the mess that was turned over to former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.</p>\n<p>“This is not the right guy to leave in front of the storm. In some respects, and I don’t enjoy saying this, could there have been an alternative, that could side step the horrible war that is claiming so many lives in such barbaric ways,” Ginsberg said. “We’ve made our share of mistakes by trying to abandon the region and thinking by doing so we can claim victory. We did that in Vietnam and we thought we could get away from it. We are not doing the same in Iraq.”</p>\n<p>Al-Omari said although there is an absence of complex critical thinking on education in the Middle East, innovators should still be given credit for their accomplishments in the brutal conditions they work in.</p>\n<p>“Although there’s a lack of such complex skills, you have to look at what these kids work through — chaos, murder, bloodshed,” al-Omari said. “There is a sheer idea that young Palestinians could work in the incubators in Israel and work in entrepreneurial computer skills that could turn into a huge center of technological enterprise in the Middle East.”</p>\n<p>According to Ginsberg, there is a significant need for critical thinking in Middle Eastern education.</p>\n<p>“I think, in terms of education, if you look at the education at the university level, there is a tremendous lack of critical thinking,” Ginsberg said. “There is a failure to provide critical thinking and skills for the marketplace. Ultimately education is about creating national identity. It is not only lack of educational skills but also lack of critical thinking that will greed into national identity.”</p>\n<p>Ginsberg said a straightforward way to prevent youth from joining ISIL exists, and one method to do so would be to take away their passports.</p>\n<p>“Three perfectly charming young educated women are on their way to Turkey to become, as they say, of the many virgins for ISIS,” Ginsberg said. “The type of person being recruited, what is driving the FBI, CIA and homeland security … there is no one way to prevent this. Parents have to ask themselves — what are their kids watching and do they have a passport? If the kids are watching bad stuff, the first thing they should do is take away their passport.”</p>\n<p>The type of kids who are most vulnerable to being recruited for ISIL are often misfits who are looking for a new adventure in life, according to Ginsberg.</p>\n<p>“They are looking for adventure, the one thing that attracts them is that they think ISIS is winning,” Ginsberg said. “They think they’ll reach a new homeland and set aside barbarity. The recruitment videos they sent out look like they’re at Disneyland!”</p>\n<p>According to al-Omari, the best way to prevent youth from joining ISIL is to try to understand and reach out to them before they are most vulnerable to join.</p>\n<p>“Once they’ve got on a plane, it’s too late,” al-Omari said. “The only thing you can do is arrest them. It’s too far out of our control. What we’re seeing right now is an attempt to start partnerships targeting communities that are the most vulnerable for being recruited and to try and understand those community members. We need to hit it before it gets to that point.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Alex Nguyen said the talk presented him with a new perspective of American foreign policy and American interests in the Middle East, and gave a clearer description of the occurrences in the Middle East and how they affect the U.S.</p>\n<p>“I had never been exposed to something like that on that kind of level in foreign affairs in that kind of detail,” Nguyen said. “It helps frame it a lot better at where the U.S. is at. You see interviews and you see press conferences on this kind of stuff all time and it always seems like it’s thrown around, but this is very condensed and helped me understand it a lot better.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said the event and others similar in nature have allowed him to apply subjects learned in his classes in order to try and solve modern conflicts.</p>\n<p>“Studying political science, you learn these theories of how people and countries work with another, and you put it in the form of what people are trying to see,” Nguyen said. “I think it’s a very healthy thing. We as college students are the minds of the future, and it’s great we’re having these events. I hope we have more.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61398\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/former-us-ambassador-gives-lecture-on-foreign-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61398\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/former-us-ambassador-gives-lecture-on-foreign-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/former-us-ambassador-gives-lecture-on-foreign-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/former-us-ambassador-gives-lecture-on-foreign-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/former-us-ambassador-gives-lecture-on-foreign-policy/","id":2887,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2886,2885,2884],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
