The board is composed of one undergraduate student and one graduate student from each UC.</p>\n<p>The board has been focused on clarifying Title IX procedures as board members believe the procedures can be hard for students to understand, according to Salvaty.</p>\n<p>“We’re in the process of changing our student procedures, not fundamentally, but adding a lot of clarity,” Salvaty said. “We’re trying to be more clear about how it works.”</p>\n<p>She said the board is considering potential amendments to the system-wide policy.</p>\n<p>The policy amendments stem from a four-year federal investigation that revealed UC Berkeley violated Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, UC Berkeley released a <a href=\"http://complianceresponse.berkeley.edu/pdf/Signed%20Resolution%20Agreement.pdf\">Resolution Agreement</a> outlining new requirements agreed upon with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), a sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Education.</p>\n<p>The changes to the policies are expected to be finalized by the end of February 2019.</p>\n<p>Salvaty’s replacement, Suzanne Taylor, previously worked as an OCR Civil Rights Attorney. Taylor currently works within UCOP as a Title IX principle investigator.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained that she believed the most meaningful work she did within OCR was in the area of sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“My goal in serving as interim is just to continue the great work that she’s done of building the office and continuing with prevention and response efforts and really identifying and helping with implementation of those practices by the campus,” she added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the May 3, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

So, rather than boring you with my philosophies on life and journalism, I’ve decided to share with you all at least a few of those things:</p>\n<p>1) Parents of incoming freshmen are really, really nervous. Oh, and sex columns scare the crap out of them.<br>\n2) Albino raccoons are invading Isla Vista. When good ol’ Albert Raccoon bit the dust last year, we thought we had seen the last of El Blanco, but we were wrong. Dead wrong. Okay, not dead wrong. At any rate, I’m taking credit for naming the celebrated I.V. mascot since I dubbed him Albert in our April Fool’s issue many moons ago. Deal with it, Facebook.<br>\n3) Associated Students elections are fierce and scary. Sometimes when I log on GOLD at night, I can still hear the screaming…<br>\n4) The Daily Nexus is the best place to work on campus.</p>\n<p>We’ve had quite the year, gang. The Daily Nexus got a front-page makeover, feature stories and a science page; our Web site got ads, videos and comment boards; UCTV made a documentary about us; we had some amazing news coverage – hello, does Hillary Clinton ring a bell? – and we took home several awards, including the honor of being named one of the top three college newspapers in the state. Oh yeah, and we stopped two subpoenas. How about them apples?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Nevertheless, I owe it to you, my amazing staff, who have suffered through some late nights, some intense stories, and above all else, my non sequiturs. I could not have done it without you. Additionally, I could not have done it without the awesome training of former editors Kaitlin Pike and Jason La.</p>\n<p>So without further delay, here is a list of my immense thanks to you all:</p>\n<p>Dianne Jobson: You have been everything I could have hoped for and more. You are the glue that holds the Nexus together. I know everyone in the office loves you, but I love you more. It’ll be weird not to work together anymore, but I’m glad that we’ll still be very close next year. I look forward to our next adventure.</p>\n<p>Sabrina Ricci: Dammit, kid, get a watch! Oh, who am I kidding. I can’t stay mad at you. You’ve done some great work with the layout this year and, holy cow, you revived the science section! Kudos, my friend.</p>\n<p>Lauren Crecelius: You are one of the most reliable people in the office. It’s been a relief to have you on the team. You are not only a fantastic editor, but a true friend.</p>\n<p>Travis Miller and Evan Wagstaff: T-Mills, you’ll always be in my heart and on my desktop, and Evan, you have a beautiful voice. Both of you have really pulled through this year and I thank you kindly. Keep it up.</p>\n<p>Aria Miran: I can’t believe you are hanging around I.V. for another year. I’m warning freshmen parents about you. Seriously, though, you have led your news desk to glory this year and we’ve had some awesome times together. I have no regrets.</p>\n<p>Jessica Mullen and Mackenzie Weinger: You write some amazing and well-researched stories and it’s always fun to watch you get excited. I am so very proud of you two and I will miss you both. Give ’em hell.</p>\n<p>Erin Currie: I thought we fired you! Ok, ok. You can keep your job. Erin, I think it’s fair to say that you are one of the nicest and most humble persons in this office. Please, don’t change!</p>\n<p>Patty Bobek and C.K. Hickey : You always come into work with a smile on your faces and you’ve handled some difficult situations with the opinion page this past year. Patty, you’ve truly encouraged me to always do more and, C.K., I suspect you are Superman, but I guess I’ll never know … I put Kryptonite in your hookah.</p>\n<p>Chris Hoffman and Alex Pavlovic: If there’s anything I’ll remember, it’s Chris’s mischievous grin and Alex’s sly-guy wit. You have rocked the world of sports this year and your columns kick ass. Call me when you make it to ESPN.</p>\n<p>Mollie Vandor and Tyler Vickers: The woman who takes shit from no one and the nicest guy in the office. You two are truly a force to be reckoned with. You guys know what you want and you take it.</p>\n<p>Erin Saldana and Rickey Mizuno: Where’s Erin? I can’t find Erin? Oh, there she is. As our pint-sized photographer you took some beautiful shots this year, and Rickey, you were always there for us when we needed you. You also make a damn fine drink. With that, I leave you with Erin’s favorite word: Chupacabra.</p>\n<p>Simon Estrada and Rick Martinez: You are so damned talented. Every time I find a piece of art I like in the paper, it usually tends to be yours, and I like the way you push your artists to excel. I see great things in your future.</p>\n<p>Valerie Tidwell, Melissa Davis, Noel Woodward, Rachel Lorencz, Virginia Yapp, and the rest of Copy: I regret that I do not have enough space to give thanks to each and every one of you. Please know that your willingness to endure some of those late nights has always left me in awe of you all.</p>\n<p>Kelly O’Halloran and Kera Zacuto: You guys made On the Menu the best section it could possibly be. Never has this section looked so beautiful. I thank you very much for you hard work.</p>\n<p>Nicki Arnold: You are too cool and I was lucky to have you by my side when I was opinion editor. I’m so glad you came back this year. You are the little sister I always wish I had.</p>\n<p>Nikki Moore, Craig Calkins and Dana Olsen: You guys may have left your desks a little early, but you never left my mind. It’s been fun growing up with you at the Nexus and I hope to run into you again post-graduation.</p>\n<p>Dan Gruen, Ryan Moll, Steve Placial: Video guys! You have helped make our vision a reality. You have formed the basis of what will likely become an integral part of the Web site. Thank you so much!</p>\n<p>Barb MacLean and J.E. Anderson: You have been my guiding lights over the past four years and you have contributed to this paper far more than you can imagine. You two are the hardest-working people we have.</p>\n<p>Jerry Roberts, Linda Meyer and Carol Dermer: I don’t know how you do it, but you do it with style.

All around, 18 to 22-year-olds are making their way towards the ocean – specifically, toward Isla Vista’s notorious Del Playa Drive. Even a few blocks away from I.V.’s main drag, the faint buzz of speakers can be heard.</p>\n<p>But first, a cup of coffee. It’s the last Friday of summer for anyone attending Santa Barbara City College, and the sergeant and his accompanying officer know that tonight is going to be a long one.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista, UCSB’s crowded, pint-sized college town is often – and falsely – called the most densely populated neighborhood on the West Coast. Its reputation for debauchery, however, is much more quantifiable: With only approximately 10 percent of the county’s total population, I.V. accounts for roughly 20 percent of serious crimes committed – the vast majority of which are linked to alcohol use.</p>\n<p>According to Sgt. Raney, curbing the use of alcohol is at the heart of what the IVFP does.</p>\n<p>“If we can control the alcohol, we can help mitigate the serious crimes and accidents [so prominent in I.V.],” Raney says.</p>\n<p><b>Not-so-medical Marijuana</b></p>\n<p>The quick jerk of the man’s hand toward his back pocket immediately catches the attention of the patrolling officers. He might as well have just walked up and told the cops he was doing something illegal.</p>\n<p>It’s 10:55 p.m. and Sgt. Raney asks the man what he just put in his back pocket. Unfortunately for this second year SBCC student, playing dumb is not going to work. Sgt. Raney suspects it may be a bag of cocaine he stuffed into his pocket (an automatic arrest), so he places the man in handcuffs and asks him again, “What’s in your pocket?”</p>\n<p>Seeing that there is no way out, the man confesses, “A gram of marijuana.”</p>\n<p>The handcuffs are removed and he is told to sit on the curb. Sgt. Raney writes out the citation for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, a misdemeanor offense that’s going to cost the toker a little more than $100.</p>\n<p>Trying to make light of the situation, the young man tells the officers he doesn’t even have a pipe to smoke his recently purchased weed.</p>\n<p>“I just figured I’d pick that up later,” he says.</p>\n<p><b>A Captain’s Tale</b></p>\n<p>“I don’t think that’s legal,” yells a reveler socializing in front of a party on oceanside Del Playa Drive. “That’s private property!”</p>\n<p>The sheriff pays him no mind and continues down the side alley, making his way toward the balcony jutting precariously out over the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>“Even if it is private property, if it’s an open party or can be viewed from the street, we have the right to enter,” Sgt. Raney says as he passes onto the property.</p>\n<p>There, unaware of his imminent arrival, are five underage drinkers enjoying the sound of the waves and the comforting warmth of Captain Morgan’s Spiced Rum. There are not many places where college students have it so good, but with the pros come the cons.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take the officers long to determine that none of the revelers are of age. However, some insist on trying to talk their way out of it, swearing that the half-drunk beers that sit directly between their feet are not theirs.</p>\n<p>Caught red-handed, however, nobody is getting out of it. All five watch as their Minor in Possessions – the most common of citations according to Sgt. Raney – are written out and their booze is poured onto the ground.</p>\n<p>One, however, is adamant about talking his way out trouble, insisting he is a good guy and that he isn’t drunk at all. Sgt. Raney agrees he is no doubt a good guy, but keeps filling out the paperwork.</p>\n<p>With the yellow citation in hand – an approximate $150 ticket plus the cost of the drug awareness classes most opt for – the young man changes gears and tries to salvage what is left of the night.</p>\n<p>“If you were honestly cool cops, you’d let me drink that beer right now,” the 19-year-old says, referring to the nearly full forty of Miller Genuine Draft sitting at his feet. Without uttering a word, the accompanying officer picks up the beer and pours it out onto the cement.</p>\n<p><b>May I Recommend a Bush?</b></p>\n<p>There are a definite drawbacks to heavy drinking (a killer hangover, a bad decision or two, not remembering if you made a bad decision or two) but few are more prevalent – or urgent – than the need to urinate.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, you just can’t find that necessary toilet.</p>\n<p>If this is the case, a trip into one of Isla Vista’s many parks could be an (illegal) necessity, but pissing on the side of building in view of the street is never a good idea.</p>\n<p>It’s 12:50 a.m. and Sgt. Raney catches a glimpse of a man making just that mistake.</p>\n<p>Upon noticing the sheriff, he instinctively grabs his phone and makes like he was busy texting, only his phone is locked and the screen remains blank.</p>\n<p>The man is asked to sit on the curb, and while the officer is filling out the citation, a resident of the apartment comes out to vouch for the man.</p>\n<p>“He’s one of my very good friends,” she tells Sgt. Raney.</p>\n<p>“Did he have permission to pee on the side of your apartment?” Raney asks with a slight smile, but receives no answer.</p>\n<p>The man is cited for breaking a county ordinance, the lesser of two possible citations. Had he been especially rude, Raney says, he could have received the more severe penalty, which carries with it a fine of over $700.</p>\n<p><b>867-5309</b></p>\n<p>It’s 1:05 a.m. and the streets of Isla Vista are still crowded, albeit more intoxicated than a few hours earlier. Sgt. Raney and his fellow officer are standing in the shadows along Del Playa Drive, waiting for something to catch their attention.</p>\n<p>A young female, clearly intoxicated, stumbles by, holding on to a young man who doesn’t appear to be a good friend. Sgt. Raney stops the pair and asks to talk with the young lady.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Raney asks if she knows her male counterpart, and she tells him that they met tonight. Her accent tells him that she is not a native to Isla Vista, and he asks her where she is staying. The young Swedish woman points back and says, “the house with the dolphins on it.”</p>\n<p>Sgt. Raney believes she is too drunk to take care of herself and, for her own safety, does not want to leave her with her newly acquired friend. He asks her if she has any other friends with her and she shakes her head, but offers to call them.</p>\n<p>The sheriff agrees, and she tries a few numbers without success, until finally reaching a friend. Sgt. Raney takes the phone from her, introduces himself and tells the young woman’s friend, “Come and get your friend, so she doesn’t go to jail.”</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, a gaggle of girls shows up and leads the young Swede away.</p>\n<p>“I was trying to protect an intoxicated woman strolling down the street with a random guy,” Raney says later. Had her friends not shown up, he says, he would have had to arrest her for public intoxication, which can have potentially serious ramifications and almost always includes a night in jail.</p>\n<p><b>Pending Sobriety</b></p>\n<p>The moon is sinking beneath the western horizon and the streets are starting to finally clear out. It’s nearly two in the morning and the fervor from hours past is starting to wane.</p>\n<p>Standing at the corner of DP and El Embarcadero, a number of the deputies congregate to discuss the night’s events, but none can help but notice when a highly intoxicated female stumbles out into the middle of street carrying her shoes in one hand and dropping her phone with the other.</p>\n<p>Two officers immediately make their way toward her, and watch as she attempts to pick up her phone, only to drop one of her shoes. The officers walk up to her and tell her to stop, but she brushes them off and continues walking, saying, “I’m not drinking.”</p>\n<p>One of the officers grabs her arm, and directs her to the curb. They ask her for her age and she tells them she’s 21. Her demeanor is combative, and she attempts to stand up, but is quickly reprimanded. She is asked her age again.</p>\n<p>“Twenty-four,” is her new answer. The deputy tells her she just gave two separate answers and she says, “I’m 23.”</p>\n<p>The officers stand her up and slap handcuffs on her. She continues to tell them that she’s not drunk, but her appeals fall on deaf ears. The deputies arrest her for being drunk in public.</p>\n<p>(An easy way to avoid this fate is to always walk with someone and never give the police a reason to stop you. Stumbling down the street and repeatedly dropping your belongings are dead giveaways.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the young lady acted unwisely and has to pay the consequences. After a few moments, a patrol car picks her up and transports her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she is housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Bates from the District of Columbia said rescinding DACA was “arbitrary and capricious,” echoing previous federal rulings earlier this year, claiming the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) failed to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful.</p>\n<p>Bates said in his decision that this marks “just two of a series of challenges to the September 2017 rescission of DACA that have already been before several district courts, two circuit courts of appeals, and the Supreme Court on two occasions.”</p>\n<p>According to Bates, neither the DHS’s legal reasoning nor its assessment of litigation risk was adequate enough to support its rescindment of DACA.</p>\n<p>The order will not go into effect until 90 days from now, giving DHS the opportunity to “better explain its rescission decision.” If the department fails to do so, it “must accept and process new as well as renewal DACA applications,” Bates said in his decision.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President specified they will not only continue to fight for DACA in the courts, but they will also urge Congress to pass legislation “that will provide permanent statutory protection for DACA.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82736\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/federal-judge-upholds-daca-will-receive-new-applications/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82736\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/federal-judge-upholds-daca-will-receive-new-applications/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/federal-judge-upholds-daca-will-receive-new-applications/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/federal-judge-upholds-daca-will-receive-new-applications/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/federal-judge-upholds-daca-will-receive-new-applications/","id":3572,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[3571,3570,3569],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
