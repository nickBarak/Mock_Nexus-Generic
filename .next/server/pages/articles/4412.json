A court date has been set for Sept. 15 of this year. <em>Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The parents of UC Santa Barbara students James Hong and David Wang — the shooter’s roommates — and their friend, George Chen, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in March 2015 against the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department and Capri Apartments, arguing that their deaths could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>While the Sheriff’s Department has been dropped from the lawsuit, Hi Desert Mobile Home Park L.P., the company that owns Capri Apartments, and Asset Campus Housing (ACH), a third-party student housing property management company, are still on the lawsuit and will face trial on Sept. 15.</p>\n<p>The defendants submitted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, but it was rejected this year on Feb. 10.</p>\n<p>Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, LLP, the two L.A.-based law firms representing the victims’ parents, claimed negligence and wrongful death against the two companies, which they believe should have properly vetted Elliot Rodger before assigning him to be Hong and Wang’s roommate.</p>\n<p>According to court documents obtained by the Nexus, the parents’ original complaint against the two companies alleged Capri Apartments was warned Rodger was a “violent and dangerous threat to his roommates.”</p>\n<p>Allegedly, the apartment company “had actual and constructive knowledge of his bizarre behavior,” yet still did not conduct a “reasonable investigation” before assigning him as Hong and Wang’s roommate.</p>\n<p>“Plaintiffs are informed and believe that [the two companies], through their on-site management personnel, were aware that law enforcement officers had come to Apt. #7 due to a dispute between Rodger and his roommates,” according to the original 2015 complaint.</p>\n<p>The complaint says as a result of the two companies’ “negligence,” Hong, Wang and Chen were “rendered completely vulnerable” to Rodger and “subjected to his violent acts, which caused their deaths.”</p>\n<p>The families are suing for any psychological, emotional or physical pain caused by the deaths of the three victims and are seeking compensation as “the Court deems just and proper.”</p>\n<p>“[The parents of Chen, Hong and Wang] have incurred funeral and burial expenses and suffered extreme and severe distress, pain, anguish and other economic and non-economic damages in an amount to be proven at trial,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Hong and Wang were assigned to Apt. #7 at Capri Apartments of Seville Road in September 2013 despite several complaints from Rodger’s old roommates about his mental well-being.</p>\n<p>In late 2011, Rodger was assigned two Hispanic male roommates who he said were “rowdy, inferior, pig-faced thugs,” according to his manifesto. Within days of meeting them, he insulted them and told them he was “superior,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>In September of 2011, Rodger was assigned a new roommate who, a few months later, “began to fear for his personal safety,” according to the complaint the parents’ lawyers filed.</p>\n<p>According to the roommate’s complaint to the apartment complex, “Living with Eliot [sic] is like living with a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, and the only way to solve this problem is by removing it. We are at the point where I fear for my safety.”</p>\n<p>The parents’ lawyers claim in a Feb. 10, 2017, court document that the three victims “simply would not have been killed” if the companies had complied with “basic industry standards and at a reasonable level of care.”</p>\n<p>A representative from Capri Apartments said they were uncomfortable commenting on the case but could say “the management company has changed since 2014.”</p>\n<p>Patrick McNicholas, partner of McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, LLP, said “the apartment was completely lacking in training its onsite managers in issues of safety, on issues of matching roommates, in issues making sure that the roommates were safe.”</p>\n<p>“The parents are very hopeful their children will not have died in vain,” he said.</p>\n<p>McNicholas also said the parents hope companies with similar business models will take student safety seriously and implement proper policies and procedures to prevent similar events.</p>\n<p>“They’re moving forward with their lives, but they are beyond devastated,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, May 25, 2017, edition of

will cost approximately $5,000, according to Kim Equinoa, assistant dean for the Women’s Center.</p>\n<p>Contraceptives like the morning-after pill and general medical supplies like Band-Aids and pain relievers will be available at the vending machine.</p>\n<p>The products will be available to Isla Vistans and UCSB students, and the machine will display information about sexual health resources available on and off campus.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center plans to finalize the full list of vending machine products by the end of Fall Quarter, according to Diane Bell, pharmacist manager at Student Health. Bell said Student Health services will restock the vending machine when required.</p>\n<p>Students proposed the vending machine because they wanted access to health services beyond the hours of normal convenience and drug stores, Equinoa said.</p>\n<p>“We started researching different ways for producing this kind of service, and our students really carried it forward,” she said.</p>\n<p>Students will be able to use cash when purchasing the products.</p>\n<p>All of the items in the machine will be over-the-counter items that are also available at Student Health. The products will cost approximately the same as those offered at the Student Health pharmacy, Equinoa said.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to keep it a little limited to begin with and then expand over time as students let us know the kinds of things that they need,” Equinoa said.</p>\n<p>A.S. approved funding for the vending machine in spring of 2015 and allowed the allocated funds to carry through to the 2017-2018 school year.</p>\n<p>The Pardall Center also offers other A.S. services to I.V. community members, such as the A.S. Legal Resource Center and the A.S. I.V. Tenants Union.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center requires that the vending machine maintains specific temperature settings so the machine does not overheat and ruin the medication. Most medications are stored in locations at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center first proposed the project in 2015, but the idea has since grown into a collaboration between UCSB Student Health services, Associated Students (A.S.) and the center.</p>\n<p>Students will have access to the vending machine during the Pardall Center’s normal hours of operation: 8 a.m. to midnight on Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Friday, 10 a.m. to 7p.m. on Saturday and noon to midnight on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center, located on the first floor of the UCSB Student Resource Building, is a department that specializes in providing resources for female students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Since its founding 40 years ago, the center has added resources for students who identify within the LGBTQ spectrum and non-traditional students, such as women who want to return to school after having children.</p>\n<p>This center also works closely with the UCSB Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) program, which deals with interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>Equinoa said she is looking forward to the vending machine’s opening in the winter and the opportunity to expand resources for students.</p>\n<p>“We’re just really excited to be able to continue providing services for students in this way and really hope to create greater access to resources for students through this project,” Equinoa said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 2, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

There will also be live music, poetry readings, craft sales and snacks.</p>\n<p><strong>SMOG OF THE SEA</strong><br>\nInterested in learning more about the wonders of the sea? Take a break from studying on Thursday and head over to the I.V. Food Cooperative at 8 p.m. to see a free screening of “The Smog of the Sea,” a documentary about a research expedition through the Sargasso Sea. The film follows an unconventional group of surfers, musicians, a spearfisher and a bodysurfer as they take a look at the amount of plastic in the ocean. There will be a raffle after the film.</p>\n<p><strong>OPEN MARKET</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Open Market from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday in Little Acorn Park will provide students with a place to buy or sell clothes, electronics and even student-made goods like clothing and artwork. Those interested in participating as vendors at the market should contact the event planner, Senga Park. Vendors must pay a vendor fee of $10, which will go toward the $200 park rental fee.</p>\n<p><strong>TO SPEAK FOR THE TREES</strong><br>\nYour Children’s Trees will be planting and maintaining a coastal oak forest at Coal Oil Point Reserve from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday. Organizers advise that interested volunteers bring water and sun protection and wear closed-toe shoes and long pants they don’t mind getting dirty. Biking to the reserve is also recommended. Your Children’s Trees is a student-run organization that hopes to create a healthier ecosystem by planting trees.</p>\n<p><strong>THAT’S SO FETCH</strong><br>\nAttention all Isla Vista pet owners: on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at People’s Park, C.A.R.E.4Paws and the UCSB Associated Students are hosting a low-cost pet vaccine clinic. Owners can keep their pets up-to-date with their vaccinations, flea medication and deworming treatment for $10 each. Owners can also buy dog licenses through Project PetSafe and sign their pet up for a free spay or neuter with C.A.R.E.4Paws. Services are first-come, first-served.<br>\n<strong> </strong><br>\n<strong>DIY GARDENING</strong><br>\nThe I.V. Food Co-op is having a home gardening workshop this Sunday from 1-3 p.m. Participants can make their own sauerkraut in a jar and learn about home gardening, including what to plant when and how to compost at home. There will be a $100 raffle giving away a home composting system.</p>\n<p><strong>SOLARBRATION</strong><br>\nThis Sunday from 3-5 p.m., the I.V. Food Co-op will be celebrating officially becoming one-third solar powered and having 100 solar panels. There will be snacks, music, raffles and a peek at the solar panels themselves. There will be an official ribbon-cutting ceremony and solar panel experts as guest speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>MEATLESS SUNDAY</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food 5 p.m. Sunday at Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Food Not Bombs is a large organization that spans the country and is a form of “franchise activism.” They believe that corporate and government priorities are skewed and allow hunger despite the abundance of food and food waste. Those interested in cooking for Sunday can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78273\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/vista-point-weekly-local-freebies-and-activities/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78273\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/vista-point-weekly-local-freebies-and-activities/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/vista-point-weekly-local-freebies-and-activities/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/vista-point-weekly-local-freebies-and-activities/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/vista-point-weekly-local-freebies-and-activities/","id":4411,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4410,4409,4408],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
