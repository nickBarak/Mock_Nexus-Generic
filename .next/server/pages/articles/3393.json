But the data it used to function has since become outdated, explained Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for information technology and chief information officer at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that most of the map’s original operators have also since left the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Due to the age of the infrastructure and some complex configuration issues, staff members with skills sets that we previously had, who understood the nuances of the configuration, are no longer here at UCSB,” Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s grown to a point where we need to staff and license it appropriately.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The map began as a joint academic project between the geography department and other data providers on campus to locate lecture halls, classrooms, food establishments and hydration stations as well as parking structures and meters, according to Hall. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/geography-dept-creates-map-of-campus-local-features/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the map was opened to the UCSB community in February 2013</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, early stages of its development began in 2008 under the leadership of Dylan Parenti, the information technology manager of the geography department at the time. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/geography-dept-creates-map-of-campus-local-features/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a Nexus article published in 2013,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the map relies on multiple layers of software which combine to make the map a multifaceted geographical tool.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the map featured interactive tools, including self-guided tours through natural spaces like the Campus Lagoon and lists of the energy consumptions of various buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Estrada, university spokesperson, said that discussions are now ongoing about “the best way to create and maintain tools and resources for navigating the university and real time and helping to ensure the best campus experience for students, faculty, staff and visitors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Hall and his team await the approval and funding they need to relaunch the map, they are working to improve certain elements of it, such as its access to the Environmental Systems Research Institute and Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage Geographic Information System, information databases that provide geographic data, Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the funding comes through, “we’ll be right back at it,” Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Feb. 18, 2020]: This article was

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The new routers should meet demand for data transmission on campus for the next five to seven years. <em>Channing Mink / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $2.7 million upgrade from 10 to 100 gigabit links is set to be completed in April, but buildings such as the University Library could see immediate improvements in data transmission speed, according to Kevin Schmidt, UCSB’s director of Enterprise Technology Services, who is in charge of the router replacement project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Schmidt said that there will not be a very noticeable immediate impact on internet speeds in most other parts of campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the previous router installation was in 2010, the rapid progression of technology in the past decade has increased demand for larger data usage, according to Schmidt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The center part of our network … is operating at speeds that were fine for its day, but the aggregate demand that we have is large enough that in order to support the future of this campus’ teaching research and community service mission, we must upgrade this,” Schmidt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new routers should meet demand for data transmission on campus for the next five to seven years, according to Schmidt, at which point they will have to be upgraded again.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $2.7 million used for the project includes the cost of the routers, labor for installation and maintenance for over the next seven years. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB data network will be down during the router installation from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. on the following Wednesdays: Feb. 26, March 4, April 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By increasing the capacity of the data network, Schmidt said the data transmission speed at individual buildings can then be improved. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If data speeds in specific buildings were increased without building more data capacity, it would be like making “really big roads that lead right into a two-lane highway,” Schmidt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want to do first is make the highway bigger, and then we’ll make the streets out to the residential neighborhoods larger,” Schmidt added, referring to various other buildings on campus as the “residential neighborhoods.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the time span for replacing the new routers is listed as three hours, the actual installations could be as short at 15 minutes, decreasing the amount of time the network is down, according to Schmidt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An upgraded network could also facilitate easier use of multimedia teaching materials, such as video, according to Rich Wolski, a professor in the computer science department at UCSB. Video uses such a large amount of data relative to other internet uses that the campus will “overwhelmingly” notice the upgrade in the form of faster video loading speeds, he added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you were to go to another research school, you would expect 10 gigabit networking to be present, you might not expect 100 [gigabits],” Wolski said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond internet usage, data transmissions on campus can typically be from researchers downloading information from NASA satellites, according to Schmidt. Information downloaded can include weather patterns and ocean temperatures over periods of time.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step in the project is to evaluate the data connections between the central network and the service in individual buildings, according to Schmidt. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We fixed the highway that brings us into the city, and then we need to look at those roads that lead off the highway into the neighborhoods,” he said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

On Dec. 9, hundreds of graduate students went on a wildcat strike, meaning the strike is not authorized by their union. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduate students, as part of their strike, refused to release over 12,000 undergraduate grades by the submission deadline of Dec. 18 until the university agreed to a COLA of $1,412 a month to supplement their current TA salaries. The university refused, and this past Monday, UCSC graduate students began an indefinite full wildcat strike, meaning a strike without the authorization of their union, UC Student-Workers Union (UAW Local 2865). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the root of the UC COLA movements is the concept of rent burden, defined as spending more than 30% of one’s wages on rent, according to the UCSC COLA website. Students’ rent burdens vary from campus to campus, but across the UC, organizers have been using rent burden to calculate COLAs specific to their respective universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While only the UCSC COLA movement has officially gone on strike, several other UCs, such as UCSB and UCSD, have now drafted and presented demands to leadership at their respective universities. At other UCs, such as UC Los Angeles, UC Berkeley and UC Davis, COLA movements are in their infancy, but are growing fast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus spoke with organizers at various UC campuses to document their COLA movements and the stages each movement is in. </span></p>\n<p>Further coverage of UCSB’s COLA movement can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><b>UC Santa Cruz:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students finished their third day on strike on Wednesday; throughout the day, hundreds of graduate students linked arms and blocked the intersection at the base of UCSC’s campus, facing off against a blockade of police officers and disrupting bus services. At least 16 people were arrested and given citations, City on a Hill Press reported, but as of 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, only one remained in custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a press release sent out by the UCSC COLA movement, at</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> least one student allegedly “had her finger broken by police, another was bleeding profusely from his head after being hit by batons, and others received bruised ribs and bones.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jane Komori, a doctoral student within the history of consciousness department and co-secretary of the UCSC Graduate Student Association, explained that at UCSC, the demand for a COLA officially began in November, when graduate students presented their demands to the university.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Santa Cruz students pay 50, 60, 70% of their wages of rent per month, which makes it next to impossible to afford most other things, especially if you have medical copays or childcare or any kind of emergency,” Komori said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, UCSC graduate students are on an indefinite strike; those who are a part of the COLA movement are not holding office hours and sections and will not release undergraduate students’ fall quarter and upcoming winter quarter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Komori said that last week, UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive offered new programs for graduate students that would help offset the cost of living, such as one that offers five years of funding at their current pay rate, and another than would provide a $2,500 a year housing supplement or fellowship for those in need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Komori called the offers “insufficient,” and said that showed, to her, that the university “doesn’t take our demands seriously at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the last she heard, administration would be starting “disciplinary action against the strike.” Several graduate students posted to social media about receiving disciplinary hearing summons and formal warning letters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Monday, upwards of 1,500 UCSC undergraduate students have also signed a petition in support of their graduate students, Komori said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Komori said the university is now refusing to meet with the striking graduate students now that they are “carrying out an unsanctioned strike.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been updating through the Twitter account </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@payusmoreucsc and on the website payusmoreucsc.com. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email statement, UC Office of the President Associate Director for Media Relations Andrew Gordon said the strike at UCSC is “illegal” and that it “does not further the discussion on how to increase housing affordability for student employees.” </span></p>\n<p><b>UC San Diego: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC San Diego’s COLA movement began last year, when the university’s Housing, Dining and Hospitality Unit — the equivalent of UCSB’s Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises — planned to increase graduate students’ rents for on-campus apartments, according to Celine Khoury, a doctoral student in literature and recording secretary within the San Diego chapter of United Automobile Workers (UAW) Local 2865, the UC-wide union representing graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students held a housing march to protest the plan, but the unit raised the price of rent regardless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was out of this momentum that the UCSD COLA movement formed, Khoury said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our [graduate students] make up 15% of our workforce,” Khoury said. “UCSD has the largest number of academic employees out of all of the UCs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a UCSD COLA fact sheet posted to the movement’s Twitter account, graduate teaching assistants made $2,434 a month, and a majority of them paid over 42% of their monthly wages in rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Khoury described the UCSD COLA moment as very “grassroots” and “collaborative,” explaining that there are a number of members of the UCSD COLA movement that are also involved with the UCSD Graduate Student Association (GSA) and the campus union, UAW 2865. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this week, the UCSD GSA unanimously passed a resolution that supported both the striking UCSC workers as well as any future action taken by graduate students at UC San Diego, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, approximately 80 members of the UCSD COLA movement, alongside a few campus groups and undergraduates, held a “peaceful march” across campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group made its way to UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla’s office, where they planned on delivering their demands, which include providing all student workers with housing stipends that translate to between $1,400 and $3,100 a month; lowering rent on all existing on-campus housing; and building affordable on-campus housing for the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Khosla didn’t open the door, Khoury said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, organizers “chanted the letter” and, before they left, “taped all of our signs to the chancellor’s door and the [outside] walls of his office.” Now, they are waiting for the chancellor to respond to their demands. The UCSD COLA movement also held a public forum Wednesday night, open to all students and faculty, to provide updates on the UC-wide COLA rallies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting online under the Twitter account @ColaUcsd. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Davis: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Rich, a doctoral student in English at UC Davis, said the UCD COLA movement began in December, in solidarity with the UCSC COLA movement. Several other UC COLA movements also held rallies in solidarity with UCSC on the same day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our initial purpose was to just try and support them, but we pretty quickly, like a lot of other campuses, were realizing that we have a lot of similar problems that Santa Cruz is having … so we used that first event as a jumping off point.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rich said the movement is currently composed of a smaller group of graduate students rather than an entire organization. They plan to attend their UCD GSA meeting and talk to the local union members about how to broaden the movement, Rich said, and they’re also starting to reach out to undergraduates as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, Rich is hoping they can draft a list of demands that also would help with equity between departments or guaranteed summer funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few members of the UCD COLA movement also travelled to UC Santa Cruz to support the strikers; according to the @ucd4cola Twitter account, one of the UCD COLA organizers was among those arrested during the Wednesday UCSC COLA strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting online under the Twitter account @ucd4cola. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Berkeley: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tara Phillips, UAW 2865 and UC Berkeley COLA organizer, said the COLA movement at UC Berkeley is “still in its infancy,” noting that it was difficult to get a COLA movement off the ground because the campus union wasn’t supportive of the movement “until recently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement’s first action was in December, she said, when around 70 people held a solidarity rally for UCSC strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We] talked about how difficult it is to get by here, how precarious the lives of grad students are because pay is so low and rent is so high,” Phillips said. “Folks were talking about landlord abuse and the inability to pay for medical treatment, loans that folks need to take out just to supplement their income … [but] also how much we love teaching, and that we wish the university valued it more.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phillips said that while most graduate students pay 50% or more of their wages on rent, that payment only lasts for 10 months of the year — nine months for the UC campuses on the quarter system — and most students “have to scramble over the summer to get rent money together, because teaching is not guaranteed in the summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re living very stressful, financially precarious lives for a long time,” she said, adding that she believes the university has done a “very poor job” in terms of equity across the various UC Berkeley departments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley’s Graduate Assembly – the equivalent of UCSB’s GSA – and UAW 2863 passed a resolution in support of the UCSC strike last week, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, Phillips said the movement is “just starting to map out what the future looks like for us, and how to keep building that movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re sort of in this educational phase … but ideally we’d like to be able to turn out a lot of graduate students to a general assembly, and discuss collectively what we want, what our demands look like, and how to pressure the administration to give us a COLA.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that UAW 2865 came up with a projected COLA for UC Berkeley to bring students out of rent burden — $2,103, the highest number so far across the UCs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting on the Facebook page “Cal COLA: Pay Us More UCB.” </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Los Angeles: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA GSA President Zak Fisher, who attends UCLA School of Law, explained that after UCSC students went on strike, the conversation of a UCLA COLA became a “hot topic of conversation.” He noted, however, that there is “no official club” for a UCLA COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen this campus today engaging this important question of, ‘How do we fight for a cost-of-living adjustment or for cost-of-living issues more generally?’ I haven’t met a graduate student yet who said, ‘No way, we get paid enough, what are you doing?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher said that he ran for GSA president on a platform of creating a cost-of-living adjustment for graduate students, among other issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, graduate students are spreading a survey around in hopes of getting a better idea of how rent-burdened students are, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As GSA president, Fisher said he has spoken to administrators about the issues that he ran on, but “they’ll give you lip service all day, saying ‘Hey, these are important issues,’ but then you’ll meet with them three months later and say, ‘Oh, what have you done? Absolutely nothing.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that he’s seen support from UCLA undergraduate students as well, noting that the undergraduate student government and the GSA unanimously passed a resolution in support for UCSC strikers, demanding that there be no retaliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone is starting to realize, this is our collective fight and our collective struggle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting under the Twitter handle @ucla4cola. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Riverside: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB COLA Outreach Committee member Adam Parison confirmed that a “pretty small” COLA movement was beginning at UC Riverside, but that the movement has no social media platforms yet, and Parison could not provide contact information for any COLA organizers at UCR.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

He founded the organization with the intention of creating a welcoming community and increasing opportunities for marginalized groups to experience outdoor adventures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdoor activities tend to be homogenous and exclude underrepresented groups, Gonzalez said. Outdoor gear is expensive and purchasing the equipment required to participate in adventures is not feasible for some students, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said he does not believe that the outdoor community intentionally excludes marginalized groups, but that there are structural factors that can limit access to these spaces, and it is important to recognize and address those factors.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People’s parents have to work, they don’t have access to the outdoors, maybe they live in cities,” Gonzalez pointed out. He also noted the lack of public transit to natural spaces, such as national parks, as a further limitation on who is able to visit those spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he acknowledged groups who aim to make adventuring more affordable for students, like UCSB Adventure Programs and Excursion Club, Gonzalez said MAPAS was created to address a deeper problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has really robust opportunities for adventure,” MAPAS Outdoors Chair and fifth-year psychology major Phoebe Rogers said. “At first glance, it’s easy to see the barrier just being a paywall, but it’s more than that for us. MAPAS is trying to carve a space where people of color and people from diverse backgrounds feel like the space was made for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea for an all-inclusive outdoor community club first came to Gonzalez from a surfing trip. While out on the water one morning, Gonzalez said an exchange student from Mexico paddled up to him and they immediately connected with one another through sharing tips and stories about surfing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He looked like me,” Gonzalez said. “I remember thinking, ‘Is this how everyone else feels? Is this how it always feels to have a community out here?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To hold onto that feeling and to encourage more diversity in the surfing community, Gonzalez had the idea to create a Latinx surfing team. But after a while, he decided he wanted the club to include all outdoor activities, not just surfing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to breaking the opportunity gap and diversifying the outdoors, Gonzalez said he wanted to bring people into the outdoors to foster greater environmental stewardship, further the conversation of environmental justice and raise awareness of the inequitable environmental burdens people of color and low-income communities experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I care about environmental issues. I’m in love with the outdoors; why wouldn’t I want to take care of it?” Gonzalez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After recruiting others who were passionate about this issue, Gonzalez said MAPAS secured funding from faculty and community members through a </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/mapas-20192020-fund?fbclid=IwAR3c5AlAFNXvwvO8n7IwuDGtpf9b3vsmwa5N073AtJ1BrWQ8q0V2mg0_nqY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GoFundMe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and applied for grants through the UCSB Healthy Campus Network. MAPAS uses these funds to purchase and rent outdoor gear, purchase food, campsites and permits, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, MAPAS has organized several hikes, kayaking trips, climbing events and volunteer restoration projects as well as a backpacking trip to Big Sur. MAPAS also hosts potlucks for its members to foster a sense of community and create opportunities for connection, which Rogers said is the ultimate goal of the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear to see what kind of community we are building, and how different that feels compared to other spaces on campus,” Rogers said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of our events feel really familial, and it’s different when you have an intention and a purpose coming together. There’s more of an energy to it,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Rogers said MAPAS has plans to continue with its “Demystifying Backpacking” workshop series to share information about backpacking. In the workshop, more experienced MAPAS members get together with first-time backpackers to break down and explain everything one needs to know about backpacking, from what gear to bring to how to purify water to what to do about going to the bathroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MAPAS also has plans to include professors in its trips to break down the “student-faculty ivory tower barrier,” Rogers said. By going on a hike with a professor, Gonzalez hopes that students can make connections with faculty outside of the classroom and learn about different research and academic opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez hopes MAPAS will be an inspiration for other UCs to create their own version of the club and eventually have a widespread community that encourages diversity in the outdoors across different campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MAPAS aims to address the lack of diversity in outdoor spaces and bring more people into the conversation,” Gonzalez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our intention is to be a launchpad,” Rogers said. “Our goal is for our members to build the skills so that they feel comfortable putting themselves into outdoor spaces and breaking down the barriers together so that those spaces don’t feel so intimidating and closed off.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92750\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/adventure-for-all-ucsb-club-mapas-provides-opportunities-for-all-students-to-experience-the-outdoors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92750\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/adventure-for-all-ucsb-club-mapas-provides-opportunities-for-all-students-to-experience-the-outdoors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/adventure-for-all-ucsb-club-mapas-provides-opportunities-for-all-students-to-experience-the-outdoors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/adventure-for-all-ucsb-club-mapas-provides-opportunities-for-all-students-to-experience-the-outdoors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/adventure-for-all-ucsb-club-mapas-provides-opportunities-for-all-students-to-experience-the-outdoors/","id":3392,"author":{"id":272,"name":"Nadia Abushanab"},"related":[3391,3390,3389],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
