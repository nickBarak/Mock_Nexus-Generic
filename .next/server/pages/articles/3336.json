They drew feedback from students in order to figure out what undergraduates wanted to prioritize in the broad subject of human sexuality, whether it be sociology, relationships, sexually transmitted diseases or the physiology and anatomy of the human sexual response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Initially, we had some dead ends as we stumbled around, trying to figure out what to do. Eventually we came up with a questionnaire where [in] the last lecture every quarter, we would ask, ‘What would you like us to expand? What would you like to shrink down?’ Eventually everything started to stabilize out,” John said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout this process, Soc 152A evolved to more heavily emphasize the subject of sexual health and the sociology of healthy relationships, while putting less time into anthropology and general biology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students] aren’t that interested in sexual variations across different cultures,” Janice explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We personally thought the stuff was fascinating. We read so many studies in anthropology, and thought, ‘Oh my God! They do it so differently!’ I mean, every culture is filled with amazing examples of how different people treat sex and gender across the planet. We just got excited — but the students weren’t that interested,” John said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time in the early ‘70s, Soc 152A also grew into a much larger class, from 100 students to 150, before the Baldwins moved to Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall, teaching 300 students. Then finally, they made the leap to Campbell Hall — with its capability to shine enormous projections of the labia, the vas deferens, ejaculation and the female orgasm — all while lecturing to 600 to 650 students at once.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the decades of teaching the course, some subjects would vary from year to year, finding time in the limelight before dropping completely off the radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are fads, you know. There was a fad of changing the minor lips [of the labia], going through surgery to get them cosmetically changed. Now the big thing is they get implants in your butt. That’s bigger than breast implants,” Janice said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Baldwins’ perspective, having two people onstage in Campbell Hall improves students’ understanding of concepts taught while also preventing students from misinterpreting what any one person says. After all, sexuality is a topic which can spur strong reactions and brings with it some baggage, Janice said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are so many people in the room that are sensitive to this. And I think if John said some of the things he says, and I wasn’t there, people could take it incorrectly,” Janice said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Soc 152A] does cover some delicate topics. We think it’s important to have tools so that people don’t think that John’s teaching this from a male perspective —”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“— or wonder whether Janice is a radical feminist,” John added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those issues don’t come up much when we’re doing it together,” Janice said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even in an era more liberal and open than when the class was initially taught, and even with the advent of the internet and online resources for sex education — which the Baldwins themselves have contributed to — the Baldwins still say there is still a place for Soc 152A.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a lot of people like international students … people from homes in which sex is not talked about, from very conservative backgrounds,” Janice said, adding that “it’s amazing how many people still benefit by taking Soc 152A.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Baldwins also found that in teaching a class like Soc 152A, their own relationship benefits. It has given them the ability to put a name onto all of the different feelings and elements which make up a loving relationship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you can verbalize things, you can plan things out a little bit better and make sure that you’ve got it really as good as you can make it,” John said. “In the old days, 50 years ago, there would have been Freudian speculation about love and relationships because it really wasn’t the science of love.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But now there really is a science of love and relationships.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"><em>Updated 2/14/2020 2:02 p.m. </em></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Life website. <em>Courtesy of Shoreline Website</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL), facilitated the initial change from paper information to OrgSync and now from OrgSync to Shoreline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he first started working at UC Santa Barbara in 2007, “the department was all paper — registration was on paper, financial transactions were paper, nothing but paper,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a simple online event-planning form that we used that we actually had to do in person with every single organization creating an event, but it was developed in the ‘90s, so the functionality was really limited,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSL then recognized a need for “a 21st-century system for student engagement” to digitize its process, Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When OSL first began to pursue digitized options, OrgSync was one of three software choices reviewed by OSL. As time went on, OrgSync was no longer properly serving the evolving needs of students from feedback the OSL had received, Ashlock said. Student organizations had trouble navigating the website and were not able to create their own sites, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, OSL began to look at different software options and found a program called CampusGroups, also known as Shoreline, Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is a student-engagement platform that doesn’t just serve the OSL, but it also serves departments in Student Affairs and across the campus and therefore is an engagement platform for every student,” Ashlock added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning from OrgSync to Shoreline had its fair share of problems, such as delays in shifting the information of organizations to the new platform, Ashlock said. The data renewal process took place last spring through a Google Form where current organizations could sign up and update their contact information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unfortunately, we lost information for about 10 organizations,” Ashlock said. “We had reached out to them on multiple occasions to invite them to complete full registration in Shoreline and up to nearly 400 organizations have. We did mention that we did contact those organizations and say, ‘You have this much time to save your website data from OrgSync, but you will lose it otherwise.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said another issue limited the number of graduate students listed, but the problem has since been fixed and graduate students are now included in the database. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the faculty and staff are being loaded onto the platform this week as well, Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSL is also working toward using Shoreline to create a more functional check-in system for when a group hosts an event. Ashlock estimates that this new feature will be ready at the end of the quarter when OSL is finished with data integration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new check-in system will offer five different ways to sign into an event, depending on the event organizer, who can enable whichever option they choose, according to Ashlock. Students will be able to check in with a QR code provided through the Shoreline app or they can scan a QR code posted at the event; alternatively, they can scan, swipe or tap their Access Card for entry, Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a lot of versatility and all of those options can exist side by side,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone with an Access Card is going to be able to check-in and keep a log of events that they’ve attended.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shoreline website is currently available online for students, and an app is in development, which will provide access to student groups and student resources, such as </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho On-Line Data (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G.O.L.D.), GauchoSpace and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billing Accounts Receivable Collections (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BARC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s basically an instant messaging platform that merges student engagement and student resources,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we developed this app, we’re looking to create, even if it’s not just a single app, a more seamless environment where students can really go and get all the information they need in an efficient way.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article <span class=\"__in\">appeared</span> on page 5 of the Nov. 21, 2019 <span class=\"__in\">print</span> <span class=\"__in\">edition</span> of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

He tallied five assists and two goals in November, finishing second behind Dortmund</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the Player of the Month voting, per </span><a href=\"http://bundesliga.com\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bundesliga.com</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with Forsberg, German striker Timo Werner is having a breakout season up top for Leipzig with eight goals in the opening 13 games. He will be hoping for a national team call-up in the upcoming months if his form keeps up. Anchoring the midfield is Naby Keïta, and the box-to-box Guinean has four goals in his first year after joining from sister club Red Bull Salzburg in the summer window.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The impact that the Austrian manager has on his teams is measurable, too.

Bundesliga on 64 points, with six points to spare on automatic promotion. In his first season with the big dogs, most notably Bayern and Dortmund, the Austrian led Ingolstadt to an 11th place finish on 40 points, worry-free of the feared relegation zone as well as earning the boss among the league</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s four Manager of the Year finalists, next to Thomas Tuchel and Pep Guardiola.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A season later, and both Hasenh</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ü</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ttl and his former club</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s fortunes have shifted drastically. Since the parties went separate ways, Ingolstadt is in deep trouble, with just six points from their first 12 games. RB Leipzig, however, in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> maiden Bundesliga season, are undefeated with nine wins and three draws, miraculously three points ahead of Munich at the top of the table.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile Arsenal, who have been in fine form early on in the Premier League season, are being forced to search for a Wenger replacement.
