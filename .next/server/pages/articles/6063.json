Career paths don’t necessarily follow the same direction (although the formulaic nature of scripts themselves are debatable). “It Starts With the Script,” a writer’s panel presented by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival hoped to shed some light onto the craft of scriptwriting and the process of using pen, paper and keyboard to project stories onto the big screen.</p>\n<p>Many screenwriters often begin work in different fields (journalism, novel penning, etc.), but quite a few have set their eyes on the movie industry from the get-go. Damien Chazelle (“Whiplash”) always knew he wanted a career in film and moved to L.A. from New Jersey. The first few years in the business found him writing for hire, doing scripts for low-budget horror and sci-fi movies until he finally found the opportunity to direct his own script.</p>\n<p>“I was hoping to get my foot in the door,” Chazelle said, “and ‘Whiplash’ was my first thing that actually convinced people to let me in. But I think that’s only because I spent a few years in the trenches writing commercial stuff before I convinced people that a jazz movie is actually viable.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Jazz was to Chazelle as journalism was to Dan Gilroy (“Nightcrawler”). After graduating college, Gilroy started writing in New York as a reporter and reviewer before deciding that writing screenplays (and working at home in his pajamas) was the way to go. But he never let go of his inner news junkie and sure enough, the control rooms of television drew him back and gave him the opportunity to fuse both passions within “Nightcrawler.” As an original screenplay, “Nightcrawler” gave Gilroy full reign to employ his creativity.</p>\n<p>“Like most of us, I do a studio job and I felt increasingly constrained by the small box that you’re allowed to move in,” Gilroy said. “Everything has to be explained, characters needed to be redeemed, and so on. I was in an ornery mood so I wrote a script for myself in which I’d decided to break every narrative rule. But it just turned out that breaking all these conventions connected with the [Nightcrawler] world.”</p>\n<p>Most scripts, however, don’t click as easily. Jason Hall (“American Sniper”) had “this tremendous responsibility and this great burden” to depict the heavy toll of war on the human psyche. Hall traveled to Texas in 2010 to meet Chris Kyle, the film’s real-life protagonist, who had left the military for about nine months. From the look in Kyle’s eyes to the way he fell on his knees to embrace his children, Hall immediately knew that this man had endured and suffered.</p>\n<p>“It’s unnatural for humans to take a life,” explained Hall. “And so, in creating this movie, we sort of did things so that it becomes easier for them to create this character that could take a life. This is a movie about a soldier. This is a story about all soldiers in a way, exploring the archetype of the warrior and what the cost is to the soldier and what the cost is to his family.”</p>\n<p>Hall wasn’t the only writer to adapt a screenplay from someone’s life story. Ever since he finished the ending of Stephen Hawking’s <em>A Brief History of Time, </em>Anthony McCarten (“The Theory of Everything”) was hooked. Writing a script about Hawking, however, wasn’t easy. McCarten didn’t want to make a movie using only publicly known facts, but Hawking didn’t allow investigation into his personal life. After reading Jane Hawking’s writing on her relationship with Stephen, McCarten took the initiative to ride a train to Cambridge and immediately declared his ambition to make a movie about her life. Brushing aside Jane’s immediate look of horror, McCarten hoped that if he was charming enough, he could have the signature for the book rights that afternoon. He waited for eight years.</p>\n<p>“The interesting point of the film was that it was about the caregiver as much as it was about the cared,” McCarten said. “They had to break their own theories about what relationships are. They’re two very conservative people, but their situation provides them to be very heroic.”</p>\n<p>For writers like Hall and McCarten, interest in someone’s life story sparked a desire to share it on the big screen. For those like Chazelle, past ambitions helped develop a screenplay with heart. For Graham Moore (“The Imitation Game”), it was both. As a teenager, Moore had a passion for computer science and was a huge Alan Turing fan. In adapting the screenplay, he put Turing’s mathematical genius at the forefront of his character, while simultaneously sparking a debate regarding the portrayal of homosexuals onscreen.</p>\n<p>“He’s a mathematician who happens to be gay, not a gay mathematician,” Moore said. “The movie was never meant to be the last word on Alan Turing; it was meant to be the first word where we wanted people to know his name. His name should be known as well as Newton’s and Darwin’s. But it’s not, because he’s gay and he’s persecuted for it.”</p>\n<p>Seeing as each panelist held a unique vision, it naturally follows that different writing strategies worked for different writers. Alex Dinelaris (“Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance”) likes to spend eight–nine months structuring a screenplay “to every inch of its life.” But often, he allows his subconscious to take over and handle the inspirational side of things.</p>\n<p>“I have two babies and when I’m changing the diaper or cooking, that’s when the subconscious starts to work,” Dinelaris explained. “An idea will hit me and when they start to pile up to the point where I think they might suffocate me, I’d fly to that little place in Puerto Rico. Cell phone doesn’t work, internet doesn’t work but eight–nine days later, I’d come back with a draft.”</p>\n<p>Max Frye (“Foxcatcher”) likes to take an old-fashioned route via yellow legal pad and felt pen. But when he takes it to the computer, the transcript is, in essence, already a rewrite. The blend of old and modern writing tools seems effective, though Frye admitted that procrastination was still an issue.</p>\n<p>“I’d get to the point where I’d keep putting it off,” Frye said, “and then it’ll be 6 o’ clock and I’d go ‘Oh, well, it’s coffee time.’ But I completely changed my life by writing first thing in the morning without doing anything else. If I even go to the bank, I’m ruined for the day.”</p>\n<p>Several panelists described similar experiences from hunting for inspiration to forcing oneself to work (Gilroy reported using stone as his writing tablet). While these were some of several recurring themes in the writers’ work, it’s clear that none of their careers started on the same course. Whether it’s utilizing the experiences from a past profession or revisiting a childhood passion, SBIFF’s writer’s panel showed that a story doesn’t necessarily start with the script as much as it starts with the heart.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60578\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60578\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-06/it-starts-with-the-script-writers-panel-sbiff-panel-uncovers-the-process-and-art-behind-screenwriting/","id":6063,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6062,6061,6060],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do","biography":"Not available","articles":[3824,3921,3922,4310,4445,5876,5902,5929,5944,5952,5975,5996,5998,6030,6040,6063,6476,6524,6949,6951,6953,6959,6960],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Alcohol Consumption No Excuse for Excessive Violence","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"One night at a party in Isla Vista I came upon a scene in which some asshole was threatening a seemingly innocent girl and consequently pissing off the wrong people.

Needless to say, he got punched in the face. While he was down, a spectator with apparent ties to the situation felt the need to add to this guy’s punishment by “kicking” him. Only instead of just kicking him, he managed to stomp his face straight into the curb. Imagine a UFC fighter, with all his strength, slamming your face between his shoe and the concrete.</p>\n<p>After the blow, the guy twitched for a second as if trying to fight the pain, then lay completely still. No one is quite sure how injured he was — if he broke his jaw or if he has permanent brain damage — but this much is positive: he was unconscious but he wasn’t dead.</p>\n<p>Does this story seem a bit excessive? Yes, I think so too. Nonetheless, it is not a fictional one. Fighting is a common occurrence among an inebriated community. From death and bloody massacres to play fighting in your living room, I would be willing to bet a solid sum that at least 80 percent of the male population and 25 percent of the female population in Isla Vista has been in a fight. I am positive that every single person living in Isla Vista has witnessed one.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Not all fights are as heinous and terrifying as this story. While some are bloody and chilling, others tend to take form in a stupider and funnier shape. Some people pick fights they cannot possibly win — like when two guys try to fight a balcony full of people because the people were talking shit to them in the street. Others are funnier fights — like when a whole bunch of your neighbors decide to rearrange their furniture by wrestling each other to the ground in a drunken stupor.</p>\n<p>So why does this phenomenon occur? The answer seems simple enough: active hormones + excessive amounts of alcohol = FIGHTING. It is a fact that when you have a certain number of males in the same area consuming insidious levels of alcohol, fighting will occur. People become emotional and even angry when alcohol starts to dominate the blood stream. Some even become like savages, unaware of and unable to control their actions, reduced to the level of the primitive beast, reacting to the plight of misplaced hormones, acting on a survival instinct that lies dormant during the hours of sober consciousness.</p>\n<p>Some of the most docile and peaceful people can be persuaded to violence with three shots of Jack Daniel’s and a bit of beer. I myself have been witness to even the most respectable and intellectual people behaving in a way fit for a zoo animal. Even I, who points my finger at you, am guilty of falling under the spell of that infamous liquid courage.</p>\n<p>Though I have only mentioned males, I will not continue to single out the fairer sex. There are plenty of women, especially in Isla Vista that are quite partial to anger and violence in the throws of inebriation. Although many times this tendency inevitably results in sobbing from either hurt feelings or a broken nose, it is usually the case that upon first meeting this person in a sober state he or she would appear quite normal. However, with the added element of liquor, that seemingly sane person could transform into some kind of wild animal.</p>\n<p>Now, I am not saying drinking alcohol is a bad thing (although, I would not recommend it to alcoholics); however, I think we all need to recognize that alcohol seriously contributes to the level of control or lack of control a person has over physical actions and emotional reactions. It is important to remember that alcohol makes everyone plain just not give a shit about anything, especially consequences. It is also important to remember that while consuming alcohol, one is more likely to experience the urge to punch another in the face or smash every piece of glass in sight or throw a television off the balcony into the middle of the street. Finally, it is most important to remember that when the courage wears away and sobriety sinks in, the consequences you didn’t give a shit about still give a shit about you.</p>\n<p>Kelly Nassour is a third-year English major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43863\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/alcohol-consumption-excuse-excessive-violence/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43863\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/alcohol-consumption-excuse-excessive-violence/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/alcohol-consumption-excuse-excessive-violence/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/alcohol-consumption-excuse-excessive-violence/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/alcohol-consumption-excuse-excessive-violence/","id":6060,"author":{"id":528,"name":"Kelly Nassour"},"related":[6059,6058,6057],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“McFarland, USA” Tells the American Story Picking and Running: Disney Film Explores Teenage Life in Central Valley","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kevin Costner plays Coach Jim White in Disney’s “McFarland, USA,” which tells the true story of a coach who inspired his seemingly hapless students to form a cross country team and go the distan...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60759\" style=\"width: 470px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"562308558\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"60867\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60759\" data-attachment-id=\"60759\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/in-photos-30th-annual-santa-barbara-international-film-festival/sbiffinphotos6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?fit=4148%2C2379&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4148,2379\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423338788\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFFinPhotos6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?fit=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?fit=888%2C509&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60759\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SBIFFinPhotos6.jpg?resize=460%2C265\" alt=\"The cast of  McFarland, USA.

In interviews in a college conference call and on the Santa Barbara International Film Festival red carpet, Costner and White talked to the <em>Daily Nexus</em> about the film.</p>\n<p>Once known as the “Heartbeat of Agriculture,” McFarland, California is home to fields of cotton, almonds, sugar beets, oranges and grapes. Within this farming town’s predominantly Latino population, many students at the local high school in 1987 did not quite feel that it was home. Neither did their new gym teacher … until he saw how fast they could run.</p>\n<p>The last thing Coach White expected to run into in this little farmland was a group of speedy students. He sought kids who strived to succeed, so he had a tournament and offered the top four runners ice-cold Gatorade, a nicety during a hot Central Valley afternoon. Seeing how quickly they raced, he upped the stakes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I took the top guys in and bought them a milkshake,” White said in a college conference call with the <em>Nexus</em>. “I wanted a little more out of them so I said, ‘If all of you can run a mile in a certain time, I’ll take y’all out to dinner.’ This way, you’re building a team instead of just an individual because they have to encourage each other as a whole.” Upon finding further success, Coach White ran the idea of starting the high school’s first cross country team by the principal, and the rest is history.</p>\n<p>To Costner, the sport aspect is merely the backdrop of the story. What made this inspirational was not so much the finish line but the authenticity. This little town in the Central Valley gave distinguished track teams a run for their money and won nine state championships. “It’s a combination of young men and a man with a level of wisdom and desire who come together with one goal in mind and achieve that through hard work,” Costner said.</p>\n<p>White established a cross country empire that dominates the sport to this day, as the pool of talented runners never seems to run dry. The 1987 team reached their stride with pure raw talent — without the gym, fancy equipment or even shoes. The seven runners ran against immense obstacles while working long hours in the fields to make ends meet. To overcome that and succeed shows that they were not run-of-the-mill high school students, a theme that manifests itself during Costner’s inspiring speech towards the end of the film.</p>\n<p>“Coaches have the power to build people up and we can equally tear someone down. So it’s a very delicate thing when you put the life of a young person [in] your hand,” said Costner. “Jim represents the difference an individual can make in a community like McFarland.”</p>\n<p>Besides being a true story, another special part about the film is that it stars three first-time actors from the town McFarland. “I think [Director] Niki Caro did a very interesting thing, casting actors from McFarland. That’s very brave. It also galvanized the community; it galvanized the boys that they were good enough to be there,” Costner said on the red carpet.</p>\n<p>Ramiro Rodriguez, who plays the film’s lovable chubby runner Danny Diaz, is from McFarland.</p>\n<p>“Seeing all the details [of the film] really brought joy to my heart. What you see onscreen is the real McFarland, [where] you see kids picking in the fields and going back to school,” he said.</p>\n<p>At the screening at SBIFF, Rodriguez waltzed down the red carpet, arms around his brothers from the movie, Michael Aguero and Rafael Martinez. All seven runners showed up to the Arlington, along with Costner and Caro. Within the boisterous group, Rodriguez and Aguero were the ones who couldn’t stop smiling.</p>\n<p>“Having us three — having all seven of us in one room, you’re going to have chemistry and chaos — nothing but jokes. We love each other like brothers, we fight each other like brothers,” Martinez said, to which the goofy-smiled Aguero interrupted. “We got competitive — we’d always push each other [onset].”</p>\n<p>Johnny Ortiz, who plays Jose Cardenas in the film, didn’t have the same playful attitude as the others at the red carpet, but gave thoughtful answers to reporters.</p>\n<p>“[The film] shows that Hispanics can play other roles … we can be doctors and lawyers … we don’t always have to be the gangbangers,” he said. At the end of the film, it was revealed that the real-life Cardenas went on to become a journalist for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.</p>\n<p>All in all, it is clear that “McFarland, USA” has meant a lot to the little community in the Central Valley.

While there was certainly a long line to get into the Arlington, there weren’t any screaming fans descending upon the historic theater to see the honorees of the night’s event. But what the five tributes lack in mainstream fame, they more than make up for in their creative triumphs.</p>\n<p>Directors Damien Chazelle, Richard Linklater, Bennett Miller, Laura Poitras and Morten Tyldum were all honored Wednesday, Feb. 4 at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. After each director answered questions from reporters, took photos on the red carpet and signed autographs for loyal fans, they proceeded inside the theater. One by one, moderator Scott Feinberg introduced the directors through praise and film clips.</p>\n<p>The first director to emerge onstage was Chazelle, writer and director of “Whiplash.” Inspired by Chazelle’s own experiences in high school, the film involves a student attempting to impress a ruthless and abusive band director. Casting the character of Terence Fletcher was a little difficult for Chazelle. He meekly explained to the audience that “I was terrified [of casting J.K. Simmons],” but was quick to praise his acting ability, joking that he seemed to be able to control the veins in his temple. Chazelle also explained his main takeaway: People should not be harmed for the sake of art.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Linklater, who wrote and directed “Boyhood,” came next. Known for his films that deal with the passage of time, the director expressed his pleasure that Austin, Texas is becoming a popular film location. He also explained to Feinberg that, when it comes to stories, “There’s a million in the world; they’re coming at you every day,” and “You need to be deluded in the right way to think you’re the right director for (a film).” He ended off his conversation by telling the audience the now-famous story of how his daughter Lorelei, one of the stars of “Boyhood,” asked him, “Dad, can my character die?” “She was really nice about it,” Linklater said. “She didn’t leave. It helped that she knew she was getting paid. S.A.G. minimum is pretty good teenage wages.”</p>\n<p>Next up was the director of the fascinating “Foxcatcher,” Miller. Beforehand, he talked to the <em>Daily Nexus</em>:</p>\n<p>Alexander Wehrung: Whose story did you want to emphasize more: Mark Shultz’s or du Pont’s?</p>\n<p>Bennett Miller: It’s really a film about relationships, between individuals, in between classes, in between values. So different parts of the film, it gets weighted on different people. But hopefully, it’s not specifically weighted on one character. It’s spread around.</p>\n<p>AW: How involved were your subjects in the production, like Mark and Dave’s widow?</p>\n<p>BM: They all availed themselves extensively to interviews and research, and they exercised no influence in the decisions in the making of the film, but they really did furnish us with a lot of information.</p>\n<p>Onstage with Feinberg, Miller talked about the odd way in which he was approached to make the film about gold-medalist Mark Shultz and schizophrenic millionaire John du Pont. “About eight years ago, I was in a store, and a stranger approached me with an envelope with newspaper clippings about the story.” That stranger turned out to be Tom Heller, who became an executive producer for “Foxcatcher.” When asked about the scene in which the Shultz brothers (played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo) grapple with each other in a bout of wrestling, Miller gave an unexpected reply of “I was thinking about Japanese Zen gardens,” which brought in laughs from the audience.</p>\n<p>After him came Poitras, director of the documentary “Citizenfour,” named after the codename Edward Snowden used to contact her with. She was also interviewed by the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Alex Wehrung: Do you think that Snowden will ever be able to return to the U.S. without being arrested?</p>\n<p>Laura Poitras: I mean, I don’t know. You look at Daniel Ellsberg, [who] was also, you know, indicted under the Espionage Act, and now I think he’s widely recognized as somebody who did something in the public interest. So probably in time, I think it could happen. But [Snowden] might end up in another country temporarily before that.</p>\n<p>AW: What was your ultimate goal in making the documentary? What did you hope to change?</p>\n<p>LP: I’m a filmmaker, so I don’t really make films to change things. I’m not an activist. But as a filmmaker and as an artist, I’m trying to say something. So what I’m trying to say is that … mass, indiscriminate surveillance is a threat and we should know about it. And it’s important that the public should know. So I want to say something about that, and it’s also ultimately a film about individuals and courage and journalism. It’s about the need for adversarial journalism.</p>\n<p>Poitras, who has been to the Middle East dozens of times to film for documentaries like “My Country, My Country,” and “The Oath” told the Arlington audience that since then, she has essentially been blacklisted by the U.S. government as a potential threat and has been detained and interrogated numerous times by border agents whenever she came back to the States. This was the reason why Snowden contacted her, as he knew she was not the kind of person who could be easily intimidated. Nowadays, she is still in contact with Snowden, but not as much anymore.</p>\n<p>The final guest was Norwegian director of “The Imitation Game” Tyldum.  He was able to answer a single question on the red carpet.</p>\n<p>Alexander Wehrung: Do you believe that your film will inspire those who are still facing discrimination today?</p>\n<p>Morten Tyldum: Oh, I hope so.  I hope also it makes people think twice about prosecuting and discriminating. And that it will get people to accept people who are different from us: different race, different religion, different sexuality. So, if people take that out of the movie, I couldn’t be happier.</p>\n<p>Tyldum, a history buff, explained that he wanted to tell his film as though it were a thriller. He expressed admiration for the film’s star, Benedict Cumberbatch, as well as the man he portrayed, Alan Turing, whom Tyldum called a mystery. “It’s something very relatable to what Alan goes through,” Tyldum said. “With injustice and prejudice, and there’s something so admirable about someone obsessed with an idea. And [the film is] about loneliness, about a man who loses everything. It’s something people really relate to.”</p>\n<p>The director also said something that summed up the lives of all five of these extraordinary people: “I never know what my next project is going to be. You just fall upon it; you fall in love with it, and become obsessed with it.” That love motivated the night’s honorees to make amazing feature films about time, loss, questionable actions, abuse and heroism. Their work is unparalleled, inspirational and motivational. Directors Chazelle, Linklater, Miller, Poitras and Tyldum are all outstanding directors.  <em> </em></p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung would once again like to apologize to Bennett Miller for accidentally calling him Linklater.  </em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/directors-given-prestigious-honors-at-sbiff-chazelle-linklater-miller-poitras-and-tyldum-reflect-at-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/directors-given-prestigious-honors-at-sbiff-chazelle-linklater-miller-poitras-and-tyldum-reflect-at-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/directors-given-prestigious-honors-at-sbiff-chazelle-linklater-miller-poitras-and-tyldum-reflect-at-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/directors-given-prestigious-honors-at-sbiff-chazelle-linklater-miller-poitras-and-tyldum-reflect-at-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-15/directors-given-prestigious-honors-at-sbiff-chazelle-linklater-miller-poitras-and-tyldum-reflect-at-arlington/","id":6062,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6061,6060,6059],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
