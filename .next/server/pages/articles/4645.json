Other activities throughout the event included a butterfly exhibit, a bounce house and a soccer game with police. Various businesses throughout I.V. offered flyer coupons to Meet Your Neighbors Day attendees.</p>\n<p>The new community center on Embarcadero del Mar opened Oct. 17, serving as an art exhibition for the day. The center displayed photographs, paintings and sculptures as well as a stage for an open mic session, a zumba class and yoga.</p>\n<p>Curator for the art exhibition and third-year art major Robert Perez said opening the Community Center on Meet Your Neighbors Day was beneficial for both events to attract a large crowd.</p>\n<p>“We want to attract as many people as possible to every event,” Perez said. “There’s so much going on today, there’s stages out in Anisq’Oyo’ Park and everywhere, so we thought it made sense to unify everything under Meet Your Neighbor Day.”</p>\n<p>Graduate student Aaron Howard said he showcased seven of his photographs of I.V. in the day-long art gallery at the community center.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think it’s a good way to bring people together and expose people’s work,” Howard said.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Taylor Nguyen said she appreciates the art exhibited being part of Meet Your Neighbors Day.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to see the artistic side of the community. I think that is something that is not always highlighted at events, but to see student artwork has been really impressive,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>Second-year mathematics major Gabriel Pragin said he helped organize Meet Your Neighbors Day and the community center launch. According to Pragin, it is very rewarding to see the event come together and I.V. residents enjoying themselves in the parks.</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to get us all to work together and be friends and meet each other in parks and have a good time listening to music, looking at art,” Pragin said. “It’s a way to get together and just be a community and support each other and have fun together.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumna and intern with the Christian organization Real Life Samantha Urena said Meet Your Neighbors Day is a good opportunity to develop stronger relationships within the community.</p>\n<p>“[Meet Your Neighbors Day] create[s] more of a community of respect and compassion and bonding over having some fun on a Saturday afternoon, not just getting drunk and making more acquaintances, but actually becoming friends with some people,” Urena said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy major Philip Griffin said he enjoyed listening to music and being outdoors during the all-day event.</p>\n<p>“[Meet Your Neighbors Day] is a really important event,” Griffin said. “It’s such a small town and we’re all so close it would be nice to have some more events that really unify everyone and create an overall sense of unity and friendship and trust.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/second-annual-meet-your-neighbors-day-presented-art-music-and-more-to-i-v-community/","id":4645,"author":{"id":155,"name":"Zareena Zaidi"},"related":[4644,4643,4642],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":155,"name":"Zareena Zaidi","biography":"Not available","articles":[2683,3859,4645],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Launch Held for New I.V.

At Saturday’s launch event, participants shared ideas and recommendations for the community center’s role and services. The center is set to be complete spring 2017.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, I.V. residents are “extremely enthusiastic” about the project.</p>\n<p>“They have formed committees to work on different aspects of it,” Farr said. “We are certainly encouraging their participation and input into all faces of it. My mantra has just been that we really want to keep the project moving forward and as on budget and on time as possible.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs Paola Dela Cruz said the community center launched after decades of inactivity due to support from the county.</p>\n<p>“I think [the community center] has to do with the opportunity that the county has given us to actually own — for the community to own — this building,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said another reason for the project’s increased momentum is a community response to challenges I.V. has recently faced.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, I think it also has to do with other events that have happened in our community which have raised awareness about the issues that we have here,” Dela Cruz said. “We do need county resources, we do need the university to invest money, we do need residents to take ownership.”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Sue Whisenand said she hopes I.V. residents of all ages and backgrounds use the community center for a variety of purposes.</p>\n<p>“For me, I see it being multigenerational,” Whisenand said. “I see it being a place where we have food events that help with building good nutrition and eating habits, and I see places where we can have different shows, and I see a pleasant place where maybe there are some parenting classes.”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Bonnie Murdock also said she wants the center to serve all I.V. communities.</p>\n<p>“I envision it as a location for flexible activities where various groups can request use of the building, and I hope it is used for residents, students and all age groups,” Murdock said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she was happy to see people come together to celebrate the project’s launch and show interest in its progress.</p>\n<p>“I’m so glad to see that throughout this process different communities have been able to come together and to talk,” Dela Cruz said. “At the beginning I think it is difficult because we all have different ideas and perspectives … but it’s nice to just see, look at this, we did it together.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The project will aid the existing trees as well as plant 30 more.<em> Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Edible Campus Program will begin the restoration of the overgrown Sueno Orchard with a group of volunteers on Oct. 16.</p>\n<p>The Sueno Orchard, a project that developed in the 1980s, lives on 6723 Sueno Road and used to house a vast array of different fruit trees, from guava to mulberry, some of which are still present in the orchard today.</p>\n<p>According to Rodney Gould, Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) general manager, the group has been mulling over the project for the past three years, as community voices clamored for restoration of the orchard each year.</p>\n<p>The feat was delayed due to insufficient funds, Gould said, and residents redirected their efforts to other community projects following the May 2014 Isla Vista shooting.</p>\n<p>Now, the process seems to be on the path to fruition as IVRPD drafts proposals for the reinstallation of a drip irrigation system, the planting of new trees and care of existing trees.</p>\n<p>“We’re fulfilling a vision that has been requested for a few years here,” Gould said. He said recent community input indicated that the restoration process was still a pertinent issue for the residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Gould, the orchard has fallen into disarray over the years.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Peace Course, a professional disc golf association, has two holes on orchard grounds, and flying disc sports have caused damage to some of the trees’ trunks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the removal of the drip irrigation system and a statewide drought have also contributed to a number of the fruit trees’ untimely deaths.</p>\n<p>Gould emphasized the main goals of the restoration effort: to put in drip irrigation and to plant 30 new trees while saving the eight healthy trees that are already on the orchard grounds.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are mulberry, citrus, apple and guava trees on the grounds of the orchard, and the project will plant more of those trees and other native species.</p>\n<p>Gould said IVRPD is drafting grant proposals and looking for student groups that will help provide funds. IVRPD will also be looking for volunteers to help on their initial cleanup day.</p>\n<p>Additional aid will come from the Santa Barbara Public Works Department in the form of fruit tree donations. Recently, the Southern California Edison Electric Company removed a few trees from different parcels along the road during road work.</p>\n<p>Afterward, the Public Works Department contacted Gould and inquired whether they could plant trees in other I.V. parks as mitigation for the removed trees.</p>\n<p>Gould instead asked for fruit trees for the burgeoning orchard. The Public Works Department will now give IVRPD between five to seven trees in exchange, he said.</p>\n<p>According to Gould, the UCSB Sustainability Program has been instrumental in raising campus and community awareness, and program coordinator Katie Maynard will be providing volunteers for the Oct. 16 cleanup day.</p>\n<p>The volunteers will be doing light trimming of the existing trees and will help build wells around those trees so that they don’t retain water while they are being watered.</p>\n<p>After the cleanup day, the process will continue with the installation of the irrigation system and the planting of the new trees. Gould said organizers hope to install irrigation prior to the middle of November and to install trees by late November.</p>\n<p>“People definitely utilize what’s there; people who have graduated also come back to Isla Vista and harvest the fruit,” Gould said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/","id":4643,"author":{"id":248,"name":"Persi Zamani"},"related":[4642,4641,4640],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students, Community Members Unite At Vigil For Andres Esteban Sanchez","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A crowd of over 100 people met outside the Associated Students Pardall Center Thursday night to honor UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez who passed away the morning of Sunday, Oct. 11.
