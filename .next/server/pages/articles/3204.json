Biology is something that students see in high school, they already have an exposure to it,” Stopple said.</p>\n<p>Stopple acknowledged the tendency for biology majors to declare the major with a pre-med track in mind, only to realize how overwhelming the major can be later on.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes [they switch out] because their grades were not good enough to get into medical school. They think ‘well if I’m not going to be a doctor then, I don’t want to do biology after all,’” Stopple said.</p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> reached out to students to gain insight on their perspectives regarding the department of biological sciences at UCSB, and found several recurring complaints.</p>\n<p>While it is to be expected that S.T.E.M. majors be rigorous and require strong academic engagement, many students expressed frustration with the difficulty of prerequisite classes, as well as an initial lack of emphasis on biology during the foundational coursework.</p>\n<p>“A lot of Bio students come in unsuspecting of how difficult the gen chem series is, especially resenting it because they’re not interested in studying chem in the first place, or necessarily good at it,” second-year pre-biology major Aja Whitehead said in an email.</p>\n<p>Many students found that the administrators and advisors were at best overburdened and at worst outright unhelpful.</p>\n<p>“The school would probably like to think that the major is hard and that’s why people are dropping it, but in all honesty I think the lack of support from the department itself plays a larger role,” Aidan, a fourth-year biology major who declined to give their last name, said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had great professors, but the advisors and administrators have never been helpful to me.”</p>\n<p>Olivia, a fourth-year aquatic biology major who asked that her last name not be used, expressed similar discontent with advisors who she felt encouraged her to take an excessive course load during her first quarter after transferring to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I really do feel that students look to the advisors for guidance and help with structuring their plans here and they do not provide that,” Olivia said.</p>\n<p>Ivan, a fourth-year biology major who asked that his last name not be used, was among a group of about 20 undergraduate molecular, cellular and developmental biology (MCDB) students who were part of an external review committee. The committee invites other faculty from universities around the west coast to evaluate the department, gather input from students and make recommendations.</p>\n<p>“The complaints against the Bio department were pretty strong… comments ranged from poor class structures during the first two years all the way to a deficit advisory team,” Ivan said.</p>\n<p>However, members of the faculty have coordinated with students in attempts to raise retention rates. Mike Wilton and Eduardo Gonzalez, two lecturers in the MCDB department, have worked to make more resources available to incoming freshmen who declare as pre-biology majors.</p>\n<p>Associated Students On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal has also been collaborating with Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) — alongside Wilton and Gonzalez — in an attempt to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>“[Wilton and Gonzalez] introduced the mentoring series MCDB 11, 12 and 13, which are to be taken in conjunction with the gen chem series,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>MCDB 11, 12 and 13 serve as chemistry support classes, so one can establish a community of like-minded peers with who to study and hold each other accountable. For classes like the general chemistry series which lack a section, Nagpal believes that these provide a more collaborative and intimate setting.</p>\n<p>“Having these support programs that [Wilton and Gonzalez] create is essential to student success,” Nagpal said. “They see that students who take MCDB 11, 12 and 13… these students specifically have higher retention rates in the pre-biology major.”</p>\n<p>EOP students are a demographic which leave the biology major at a much higher rate than the general student body, Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>“Low-income students have to work for college compared to their more-privileged peers… because of this they can’t devote as much attention to their academics,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>Nagpal is advocating for the expansion of financial support to more EOP-eligible students, which he hopes will alleviate some of this financial stress.</p>\n<p>“EOP has an emergency grant alongside A.S., and as a senator I have taken it upon myself to work with the director of EOP, Aaron Jones, to revise the A.S. EOP grant and essentially expand this,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>Although a consensus from students is relatively easy to find just by surveying the academic body, extensive qualitative information regarding the “why” of switching majors has not been compiled.</p>\n<p>“I’d love to have more data in many ways, and know more about the process by which students change majors. We could do better generally, as a campus, in collecting data,” Stopple said.</p>\n<p><i>Updated [9:46 p.m.]</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Students and faculty can search for open access online, use a inter-library loan or asking a librarian for more options.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Day in and day out, our librarians are finding content that’s behind paywalls, content that is out there that students, faculty [and] the UCSB community need to find,” Rick Stockwood, communications and marketing manager at the UCSB library, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If someone stumbles across a paywall like we all do almost everyday, trying to reach something, the librarians are here to help find that content.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Librarians at UC libraries are also able to purchase specific articles for access using the budget that would normally go to funding the contract with Elsevier, according to Antelman.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the library acquisition budget will also go to investing in open access initiatives elsewhere and working with a subcommittee of the Academic Senate to create a fund to facilitate open access of UC research articles, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UC researchers have to pay an article processing charge to Elsevier in order to enable open access to their articles, which Antelman said usually costs around $3,000. This fund would help researchers cover this cost.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Through the subscription dollars the library is currently paying, we would help subsidize those fees and they would be lower so that if the researcher wanted to publish open access, they would pay much less,” Antelman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The push for open access of UC research articles started in 2013 when the UC Academic Senate adopted a policy which iterated UC’s commitment to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disseminating its research and scholarship as widely as possible,” according to the official policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will soon sign onto an “</span><a href=\"https://oa2020.org/mission/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expression of Interest,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” according to Antelman, which asserts the importance of creating open access for research article and leaving the subscription model of the industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other UC signatories of the document include UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC San Francisco, UC Riverside, UC Los Angeles and most recently UC San Diego. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC isn’t completely closing to door to Elsevier, however. UC still retains access to most articles from Elsevier before 2019 and room remains for more negotiations in the future, Antelman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re hopeful that over time, Elsevier will possibly come back with another proposal and that we could possibly have a successful deal concluded, but at this point, it doesn’t look like that will happen anytime soon.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday marks the fulfillment of some of Black Student Union’s (BSU) primary goals in its demands throughout the years: the creation of an Office of Black Student Development at UCSB and a space on campus dedicated to Black students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Henry T. Yang sent a message to the BSU Demands Team yesterday, promising funding for BSU’s eight proposed positions within the office, $55,000 annually for BSU programs and that the university would “work toward the vision of a Center for Black Student Development over the next several years,” according to the message.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These proposals were part of the most recent <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\">set of demands</a> BSU released to the university in February, but built upon over 50 years of efforts from previous generations of BSU students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For BSU President Mariyah Lewis and BSU Demands Team leader Samantha Sanchez, seeing the fulfillment of these demands warranted a moment for the two to pause from their efforts and celebrate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I cried for about two and a half hours,” Sanchez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The commitment the university made to the Black student community by fulfilling these demands speaks to a greater awareness of Black students and their unique needs as a student community on campus, Lewis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a good feeling to say the least, to know the administration is pushing for us and striving for better support of Black students on campus,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang said BSU’s demands represent a vital aspect of university’s commitments, which include </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“creating a culture that affirms the intrinsic dignity in each of us, celebrating differences, and making UC Santa Barbara an inclusive environment in which to live, work, and learn,” he wrote in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email to Black student groups and community members, Sanchez acknowledged the strides made by UCSB administrators in its support of Black students, noting that these commitments are a symbol of courage as well as progress toward equity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes strong leadership and courage on the behalf of administration to understand and implement a structure to repair those deficits and restore the Black community’s faith in the education system. Today, our university administration displayed both this leadership and courage,” Sanchez wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, Sanchez said the fruition of these demands will pave the way for “monumental initiatives across the UC system to create greater access to higher institutions of learning and overall achievement for Black people and people of color.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanchez said that the hiring process for positions in the Office of Black Student Development can start immediately. The positions will be developed within the Division of Student Affairs, and  hiring will be led by BSU members and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The positions within the office include a director, an assistant director, two academic support counselors, a recruitment and retention specialist, a coordinator of Black student life and two advocacy counselors. The budget for the positions totaled about $900,000, according to BSU’s list of demands, and will be provided by the Chancellor’s Office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Lewis and Sanchez emphasized that their work to help the Black student community is not over. Changes are still needed within universities to create equity among minority student populations, and BSU is far from short of ideas for how this change can happen, Lewis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are so many more things that we can imagine.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

After winning the Premier League in 2009, Ferguson was handed the task of rebuilding the team after basically being forced into selling his best player, Cristiano Ronaldo, to Real Madrid.</p>\n<p>Not only that but during this time, the economic climate of English football was radically changing. Free-spending Chelsea and Manchester City were breaking transfer records left and right, and Ferguson simply didn’t have the same amount of funds at his disposal.</p>\n<p>However, with his deft maneuvering in the transfer market, he built a squad that has now won the Premier League title two out of the last three years. United have also made two appearances in the Champions League final, but unfortunately were matched up against a Barcelona squad that many consider to be the best team of all-time.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, now that Sir Alex has announced he’s stepping down, it is time for everyone who enjoys the beautiful game, not just United fans, to look back and marvel at everything he has accomplished over his illustrious career.
