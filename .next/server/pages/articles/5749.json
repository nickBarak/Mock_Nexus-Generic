Hosted by ABC, this near century-old event has only changed with its decline in relevance. The Oscars, in recent years, have become much more associated with their lack of recognition of underrepresented voices than its appreciation for cinema as a whole, which should only instill apathy for the award among their viewers. That being said, an Oscar award remains the highest honor that can be bestowed on a cast and crew for a film they have dedicated blood, sweat and tears to — which is enough motivation for me to write this article. But, before I actually talk about the movies that have been nominated, I want to recognize some films I happened to watch last year that are just as deserving as these other movies of acclaim.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>My Snub List, or Movies I Thought Deserved More:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Booksmart,” “The Lighthouse” (nominated only for cinematography), “High Life,” “Brittany Runs a Marathon,” “Midsommar,” “Motherless Brooklyn,” “Dark Waters,” “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” (nominated only for Best Supporting Actor), “Waves,” “Honey Boy,” “Uncut Gems,” “The Peanut Butter Falcon” and “Judy” (nominated only for Best Leading Actress)</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The Big Hitters:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These are the usual suspects for insiders — the movies that have been getting buzz for months, especially the films that come out of the festival circuit, which are oftentimes the most nominated and likeliest winners of the night. Generally, these movies are propped up with a sort of pedigree, meaning that there are legacy names attached to them (a large part as to why people of color and women aren’t nominated as often). The big hitters this year are: “The Irishman,” “Marriage Story,” “1917,” “Parasite” and “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Irishman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 10</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love this movie. It’s a perfect bookend to this era of Scorsese film — it’s an epic, it has some of the greatest American actors of all time and it perfectly captures how Marty’s perception of the rock-star gangster has evolved. The movie leaves you in a state of shocking pity in how you can feel so sad for such a terrible character and evokes debilitating fear for the isolation and oblivion that come with old age. It is long and can seem at times a little tedious to get through, but the ending affords all of that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve spoken with a friend of mine who is much better at predicting the Oscars than I am, and he says that this movie is going to get shut out. But I don’t happen to think so. This movie has the names, has the pedigree and has the quality behind its push. I don’t think it’s going to win a majority of the 10 Oscars it’s nominated for, but I think it has Best Director and Best Supporting Actor in the bag. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marriage Story</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 6</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92679\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"81920567\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92679\" data-attachment-id=\"92679\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/a-rundown-of-this-years-oscar-noms-whos-going-to-win/mcdmast-zx005/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?fit=2048%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MCDMAST ZX005\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?fit=888%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92679\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?resize=888%2C444\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?resize=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?resize=1536%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another one of my favorites of the year, “Marriage Story” follows the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">initially amicable but soon-turned-ugly divorce between a theater director and an actress. It brilliantly portrays the reasoning, misconceptions and aggressions coming from both sides so that the viewer isn’t necessarily in between the two but understands where each side is coming from. It also unravels their marriage and compares it to their professional dynamic, one of the most interesting aspects of their marriage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is pretty locked in for the Oscars it’s going to win. Laura Dern has won nearly every significant award for her role leading up to the Oscars: the BAFTAs, the SAG award and the Golden Globe. I would consider her a guarantee for the Best Supporting Actress category. Where I think this movie is a tossup for a win in the Best Leading Actress category; Ren</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ée </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zellweger has swept in the preceding award shows, but her movie has lost a bit of momentum coming into the Oscars season. Personally, I think Scarlett Johansson is going to pick up Best Actress, but I’ll happily be wrong if Zellweger wins.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parasite</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 6 </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92681\" style=\"width: 1745px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"947269518\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92681\" data-attachment-id=\"92681\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/a-rundown-of-this-years-oscar-noms-whos-going-to-win/america-magazine/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?fit=1735%2C1057&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1735,1057\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"America Magazine\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?fit=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?fit=888%2C541&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92681\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?resize=888%2C541\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?w=1735&amp;ssl=1 1735w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?resize=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?resize=1024%2C624&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?resize=768%2C468&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?resize=1536%2C936&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92681\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of America Magazine</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think this film is my favorite of 2019, and maybe one of my favorites of all time. It’s something I have never seen before — it’s daring, provocative and funny. There’s a shift in tone in this movie that coincides with a shift in the understanding of the overall framework of the narrative the family has spun. It is done masterfully and subtly, which is also strange considering how bonkers this movie really is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie’s chances for Sunday night are much less set in stone. It’s definitely winning in the Best Foreign Film category because it’s the only movie in that category to be nominated for Best Picture as well. I also think it’s a shoo-in for Best Original Screenplay, but this movie has the potential to be the first foreign film to ever win Best Picture. It would be a shame on so many levels if Best Picture went to anything else; this movie has been lauded by critics and audiences alike and would make a powerful statement about mainstream American cinema. I hope dearly this movie wins, but I have a growing suspicion that it won’t. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1917</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 10</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having seen this movie rather recently, I don’t understand why it has garnered as much attention and buzz as it has. It felt like a dollar store version of “Dunkirk” with the dialogue of a “Call of Duty” video game. I felt bored throughout the film, except for the three-minute running scene near the end, and could not wait for the credits to finally roll. It felt shallow and redundant in the context of the war genre, which contains some of the greatest films both cinematically and thematically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know what this movie is going to win — probably because I don’t like it very much. I think its best shot is for the cinematography work done by the prolific Roger Deakins. This movie has the momentum it needs; it has won Best Picture at nearly all of the significant awards preceding the Oscars. I hope it doesn’t win and would actually be quite mad if it does. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 10 </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92682\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"383852818\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92682\" data-attachment-id=\"92682\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/a-rundown-of-this-years-oscar-noms-whos-going-to-win/vox/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Vox\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92682\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92682\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Vox</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a controversial take: I don’t get why this movie is nominated for Best Picture either. I like this movie, but I don’t love it. I appreciate the fact that Quentin Tarantino brought together a cast that was almost made for a reflection on stardom in Hollywood, and the cast did a fantastic job. I sort of separate the movie into three lenses, all of which have an interesting take on the situation at hand: the has-been, the never-was and the rising star. The core story at work is fascinating, but I just feel there’s too much fat around the interesting stuff for it to be amazing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, my opinion has absolutely no bearing on what’s going to win or lose, and there are a bunch of people who adore this movie. That being said, I don’t think this movie is going to win that many Oscars. I think the sure-fire bet is on Best Production Design; Tarantino recreated old Hollywood to a near-perfect degree (just look at the marquees as Margot Robbie walks into the theater). I think its second strongest bet is on Best Supporting Actor, even though I think Al Pacino is taking it for “The Irishman,” because Brad Pitt has been sweeping in the award shows leading up. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The Nods: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would consider these movies the dark horses of the race. These are the unsung heroes of the Oscars; they often show up for the nomination and go home empty-handed. It’s not impossible that these movies will win, just improbable — and I’d love to see it. Without any type of recognition for these cinematic darlings, the Oscars would look even more pointless in the eyes of cinephiles than they already do. For me, this year’s nods are “Jojo Rabbit,” “Little Women” and “Ford v. Ferrari.” </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jojo Rabbit</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 6</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92683\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"660162980\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92683\" data-attachment-id=\"92683\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/a-rundown-of-this-years-oscar-noms-whos-going-to-win/variety-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?fit=1000%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,563\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Variety\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92683\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I don’t love “Jojo Rabbit” as much as some other people, it should 100% be on display at this award ceremony.

But “Little Women” doesn’t simply retread the past; Gerwig reimagines the story by jumping between multiple time points instead of sticking to chronological order. Even as she changes the source material, she remains true to the heart of the story, and the spirit of the March sisters shines like it never has before onscreen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gerwig could possibly take the award for best adapted screenplay, but the only expected win is for Jacqueline Durran for costume design. Saoirse Ronan (Jo March) and Florence Pugh (Amy March) both delivered top-notch performances for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. But in a particularly competitive year, it would be a (pleasant) shock if either took home the prize. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ford v Ferrari</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 4</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92685\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1673136994\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92685\" data-attachment-id=\"92685\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/a-rundown-of-this-years-oscar-noms-whos-going-to-win/grist/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,576\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Grist\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92685\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92685\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Merrick Morton / 20th Century Fox</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ford v Ferrari” is a straightforward popcorn flick that was an absolute joy to watch. It was one of my favorites from last year, with Christian Bale and Matt Damon absolutely killing it in their respective roles. However, I don’t expect it to win much beyond a few technical categories like sound and editing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The point of the Oscars is to appreciate cinema and for some reason we’ve decided as a culture that a trophy, plaque or a certificate is the best way to recognize different achievements. There is nothing wrong with symbols of gratitude, and in a lot of ways these symbols are soothing because they’re unequivocal — you won the Oscar for the category you were nominated for. Yet still, there have been many films that have won Best Picture that couldn’t matter less to me. If I were to create something (which I hope to someday), I would want to leave an imprint on the audience, because the ideas that I would bake into what I create mean something to me — and it means something to me that those ideas mean something to the people watching. So when you watch a movie, let it wash over you — give it meaning, because these awards don’t. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed to the “Little Women” section of this article.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Downey’s time as Tony Stark, over a decade long, has yet to be beaten by the numerous other characters he has portrayed. I had wondered where Downey would go after leaving a multi-billion dollar franchise; never would I have guessed that the next character he would portray would be that of Dr. Dolittle. His new film, “Dolittle,” contains an all-star cast, including Selena Gomez, Antonio Banderas, Tom Holland, Emma Thompson and many more.</p>\n<p>While Eddie Murphy’s take on the role is seen as a “classic,” at least through the eyes of a child, Downey’s take is very different — the entire story and its characters have no relation to Murphy’s 1998 “Dr. Dolittle.” The plot of the newest rendition consists of Dr. Dolittle living in solitude with his many exotic animals as he grieves the loss of his wife. He is then visited by attendants of Queen Victoria who seek Dolittle’s help in retrieving a cure for her. The action-packed film, with its both humorous and sentimental dialogue, primes it to be an enjoyable watch for all ages. With that being said, it does not exceed any more depth than that of a plain, generic family film.</p>\n<p>The special effects were positively breathtaking, with every scene showcasing an abundance of vibrant colors. Though the scenes were stunning, they were often messy. The transitions between locations make your head want to spin, and they cram so many different obstacles in various locations that the development is completely lost.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As for Downey’s acting, his accent was different, and his overall portrayal was fun. Downey’s accent is not characteristic of a common British accent, but instead takes more of an eccentric approach. Halfway through the movie, you begin to realize why Downey doesn’t speak in the trailer — his accent is distracting, outrageous, and in other words, overdone. Playing such a serious and dramatic character for so many years, I can see why Downey agreed to join a project so light. Downey is a great actor and this role does not diminish his talent, but it also does not challenge him.</p>\n<p>Stephen Gaghan directed “Dolittle,” which is quite a surprise considering that his past films consist of drama and crime, surely not that of CGI’d talking animals. Gaghan’s shots were very predictable and rather cliche in trying to draw out emotion from the audience. Gaghan’s jump to fantasy was a bit of a stretch, and he is much better suited within the drama and crime realm.</p>\n<p>The music was scored by Danny Elfman, the same man who composed the music for films such as “Beetlejuice,” “Good Will Hunting,” the “Men in Black” franchise, Tim Burton’s “Corpse Bride” and the “Fifty Shades of Grey” franchise, just to name a few. The music for this film was objectively the best part of it. With such big movies already on Elfman’s roster, this comes as no surprise. The grand emotional strides of the strings and the suspenseful beats sweep you off your feet and wrap you in sweet and dramatic emotions.</p>\n<p>Overall, a 6.5/10 rating, this movie is not something that anyone above the age of nine should be running to the theaters to see. This is simply another film looking for a profit, bringing nothing special or surprising to the table.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that “Dolittle” was a Disney film. “Dolittle” is a Universal Pictures film. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Spoilers Ahead! </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Horse Girl,” a new Netflix 2020 drama, is something very different and unexpected. The two-hour-long drama keeps you actively engaged in the story as well as keeps you curious as to how the film will eventually end. Actress Alison Brie, known for her roles in productions like “BoJack Horseman” and “Community,” co-wrote the screenplay alongside director Jeff Baena and starred in the film as its lead character Sarah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah, a young woman whose lucid dreams become intensely vivid, struggles in differentiating these fantasies from reality. Brie does a remarkable job of surfacing many different emotions as well as evoking several emotions from the viewer with her portrayal of Sarah. You feel her discomfort, stress and unease in every scene as almost as if you were actually there. “Horse Girl” is undoubtedly a psychedelic trip of a movie, often leaving the viewer to question what is actually happening. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film provides you with many plausible explanations for Sarah’s behavior including cloning,  alien abduction, borderline schizophrenia and a history of mental illness within her family. From the very beginning, you can easily tell that Sarah doesn’t blend well with others in her life — simply put, she just doesn’t fit in. For the most part, Sarah believes that she is a clone of her grandmother, constantly comparing their uncanny resemblances. Sarah, already being an awkward character from the jump, only then begins to suffer from events that resemble schizophrenic episodes. But it’s more than that; there’s a mysterious and unexplained layer roaming over the plot throughout the film. Only at the end does everything get pieced together, but you are still left without the satisfaction that anything truly got resolved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way in which this film’s sequence of events is carried out is very well done. Its depiction of time is one of constant bending and overlapping, forcing you to reevaluate your original thoughts and recall scenes that occurred in the film’s beginning. In short, every scene within “Horse Girl” is imperative to its central plot. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92816\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1814919151\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92815\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92816\" data-attachment-id=\"92816\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/the-daily-caller/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?fit=1200%2C516&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,516\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Daily Caller\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?fit=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?fit=888%2C382&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92816\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=888%2C382\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=250%2C108&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=1024%2C440&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Daily-Caller.jpg?resize=768%2C330&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92816\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of The Daily Caller</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that being said, there were some plot holes as well as certain depictions that seemed a bit excessive and exaggerated. Right as the film hits its climax, Sarah goes on a rather pointless venture dressed as a “pink ninja” — this scene seems as if it was created just to emphasize a trippy and kaleidoscopic aesthetic and ruins the initial effect of using all these distracting scenes in the first place. Then, there’s the mystery of her mother’s death and Sarah’s relationship with her stepfather. Both storylines are introduced, but neither are ever taken into more depth. The film implies that her past has a heavy and murky influence on both her personality and current ticks. Sadly, the viewer is only given a very minimal outlook on that part of Sarah’s life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another plot hole within the film would be that of the DNA test that Sarah takes about halfway through the film. The test was suggested to her by her coworker who had taken the test herself to discover more about her genetics. Sarah never receives the results for this test and instead just assumes that they are inconclusive. The DNA test, as well as a traumatic horse riding accident, are both ignored for the majority of the film. We are introduced to a childhood friend of Sarah’s that was immensely affected by the incident, but we are never truly given a reason to how this is relevant to the central plot — it seems as if it was put in just to fill time. Sarah’s obsession with horses and her discontinuation of riding them is also never fully addressed or explained. Her stepfather is decently wealthy, so even the sale of her horse doesn’t add up. These little intricacies distract from the main storyline and poorly develop Sarah’s overall character.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the film’s soundtrack, it was performed and composed by Josiah Steinbrick and Jeremy Zuckerman; this will be both composers’ first major accredited work in film. The music fits well with the theme of the film and highlights the anxiety-inducing and dramatic scenes very well. Its use of synth and tranquil sounds resembling wind chimes synchronizes nicely with the overall tone of the scenes. If you were simply to listen to the original soundtrack alone, it would be very similar to one that is played in the background at a spa. </span></p>\n<p><b>Overall Rating:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 8/10 — Aside from the abundant release of dramas premiering on Netflix recently, this film does take a different and interesting approach, compiled of many puzzling and somewhat cringy scenes. Nonetheless, I would suggest that people still see this film. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92815\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92815\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/in-review-horse-girl/","id":5747,"author":{"id":769,"name":"Arielle Bitton"},"related":[5746,5745,5744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“To All the Boys: P.S.

I, along with the rest of the teenage girls of America, felt like I was personally a part of Lara Jean’s romantic quest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I watched the first movie in an Airbnb in New Mexico, feeling somewhat fulfilled by the film adaptation and charmed enough to feel content. While the movie left out a lot of key elements from the novel, I still was hopeful and excited for the sequel.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I read “P.S. I Still Love You”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recently this past holiday season, loving it even more than the first book for all its plot twists and lasting hopeless romanticism of one of my favorite main characters of all time, Lara Jean. I fittingly watched the movie in my bed on Valentine’s Day, again hopeful that it would live up to the book’s rollercoaster of emotions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lara Jean (Lana Condor) and Peter (Noah Centineo) are in the lusty beginnings of their relationship as the story begins: going on their first date, first family dinner, etc. Quickly, Lara Jean and Peter realize the presence of outside influences on their relationship </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which bring a few threats to their happiness as a couple. One of these threats happens to be Peter’s ex-girlfriend Gen; the other being the re-appearance of Lara Jean’s middle-school crush and letter-receiver John Ambrose McClaren (Jordan Fisher) back into her life. Lara Jean faces an inner conflict throughout the story, weighing whether to stay in her relationship with Peter or embark upon a new romantic conquest with John Ambrose. John Ambrose’s personality serves as the utter opposite of Peter’s, posing a substantial disruption to Lara Jean’s romance with Peter.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92860\" style=\"width: 1110px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2038633962\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92857\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92860\" data-attachment-id=\"92860\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-19/to-all-the-boys-p-s-i-still-love-you-does-it-live-up-to-the-hype/insider/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?fit=1100%2C825&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1100,825\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Insider\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92860\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?w=1100&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insider.jpeg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lara Jean (Lana Condor) and John Ambrose McClaren (Jordan Fisher) in “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You.” Courtesy of Insider</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actor Fisher’s entrance into the “To All the Boys” universe was a smart decision for the film franchise, as his portrayal of John Ambrose adds even more charm to the rom-com and adeptly convinces audiences why Lara Jean’s feelings began to resurface for her middle-school love interest in the first place. Similarly, the performance of Lana Condor alone keeps the film afloat, as her indecisive but genuine nature in the film helps develop her rightful portrayal of Lara Jean. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, Peter and Lara Jean’s relationship seems more strained in the movie than romantic, giving viewers a little less charm from Centineo than previously used to. Peter and Lara’s chemistry is what drew a lot of viewer attention from the first movie, this same chemistry somewhat lacking screen time in the sequel. This not only left me questioning why she chose Peter to be with in the end, but a lot of the </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=peter%20kavinsky&amp;src=typeahead_click\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter universe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well. The “P.S. I Still Love You” movie</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crafts the story in a way that makes John Ambrose seem like the rightful romantic choice in a drastically more obvious matter than in the book. This discrepancy is due to a lot more open-ended dialogue and interaction between Peter and Lara Jean being left out in the transition from book to film.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92858\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1705470290\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92857\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92858\" data-attachment-id=\"92858\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-19/to-all-the-boys-p-s-i-still-love-you-does-it-live-up-to-the-hype/mamamia/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mamamia\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92858 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mamamia.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92858\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lara Jean (Lana Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo) in “To All the Boys: P.S.

This game was an essential piece not only to the slow build of conflict between Peter and Lara Jean, but also one of the main ways in which she grows closer to John Ambrose. Lara Jean’s decision to choose Peter in the movie was one that was almost immediate after she kissed John Ambrose, a heavy alteration from the book where Lara Jean deliberates who she will choose for a steady amount of time after the kiss. Because of this, the ending seemed overwhelmingly rushed to deliver a happy finish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite wanting to see the film add more elements of the novel to give the plot more nuance in whole, the entertaining journey of the movie adaptation of “P.S. I Still Love You” stays satisfactory in that it is sequentially about trying to make Lara Jean’s relationship with Peter work, despite her doubts and insecurities. Lara Jean’s ending commitment to Peter shows her growth in character and maturity in her first relationship. While overall it may seem confusing to viewers that she didn’t choose John Ambrose, the message is about making a difficult but worthwhile decision to make a relationship work with someone you fell in love with in the first place — a message that a lot of young viewers can relate to. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.
