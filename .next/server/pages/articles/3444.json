The meeting was originally to be held at the I.V. Food Co-Op but changed location due to rainy weather. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">During the meeting, forum-attendees discussed the possibility of creating an Area Planning Commission with jurisdiction over planning in I.V., the university’s plans to potentially provide housing for staff in I.V. and the possible creation of an elected “police collaborative board,” responsible for meeting with local law enforcement periodically to discuss law enforcement-related issues in I.V. </span></span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In regard to the proposed Area Planning Commission, <span class=\"st\">—</span> which would function through the County Board of Supervisors and specialized Community Services District (CSD), if the Special District is approved and passed <span class=\"st\">—</span> Abboud said the commission would approve building projects and their regulations as either a potential function of the CSD or possibly the CSD itself.<br>\n</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Schunk, I.V.’s historical divide between students and non-student residents has caused a disconnect that has led to I.V. becoming an unsafe neighborhood that disenfranchises many residents.

It is only able to provide services,” Freeman said. “All the things that regularly plague I.V. require legislation to fix, not services. The things that CSD can provide don’t go far enough.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The forum concluded with attendees agreeing that information about I.V. self-governance and its related meetings should be better disseminated and advertised to residents, such as students and Latino families, via back-to-back forums held in areas residents feel comfortable meeting. The next I.V. self-governance town hall meeting will be hosted shortly after Schunk takes office. </span></span></p>\n<p><em><strong>[Correction 11/17/14:</strong> An earlier version of this article stated that, during the Nov 14 meeting, “attendees discussed the possibility of creating an Area Planning Committee to allow affordable housing options in I.V. to non-students— primarily university staff” when in fact the Area Planning Commission only gives jurisdiction over planning in I.V., not over what kind of housing the university provides. Also, the plan to provide housing for UCSB staff in I.V. is not related to self-governance and is in fact solely a function and idea of the University.</em></p>\n<p><em> In addition, an earlier version of this article stated that “Abboud said the [Area Planning Committee]’s potential implementation would likely be through the university and would be responsible for infrastructure maintenance and the distribution of student and non-student residents throughout I.V.” when in fact the Area Planning Commission would function through the County Board of Supervisors and potential future Special District and would not be responsible for infrastructure maintenance. It also has nothing to do with the university. </em></p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus <em>regrets these errors.]</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58279\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58279\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/public-forum-discusses-options-for-i-v/","id":3444,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3443,3442,3441],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report","biography":"Not available","articles":[1981,1982,2072,2234,2284,2351,2370,2417,2437,2512,2534,2614,2711,2733,2738,2754,2801,2827,2835,2940,2984,2992,3004,3036,3044,3090,3438,3439,3444,3450,3453,3465,3470,3471,3520,3581,3628,3655,3679,3698,3764,3776,3789,3791,3792,3794,3797,3800,3907,3958,3970,4043,4061,4134,4135,4169,4189,4190,4196,4197,4199,4213,4215,4216,4230,4232,4236,4244,4249,4250,4253,4262,4271,4277,4279,4281,4293,4294,4296,4309,4314,4315,4325,4328,4330,4343,4345,4346,4354,4364,4373,4374,4400,4405,4411,4412,4424,4425,4427,4429,4439,4446,4460,4461,4463,4468,4485,4486,4580,4635,4638,4640,4644,4702,4707,4728,4761,4777,4814,8046],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Psychology Alum Turns Singer-Songwriter: The Beauty of the Party-Study-Play Music Balance at UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"More than any other California school, UC Santa Barbara students have a tendency to get defensive about their alma mater.

It’s a delicate topic. Is this a party school, or is this a world-class research university? The answer usually gets tied down in the celebrated Gaucho motto, “Work hard, play hard.”</p>\n<p>But what this four letter chant fails to observe is the enormous artistic community that is alive on campus and in our quaint seatown Isla Vista. I.V.’s special aura of friendliness and creativity allows things like Bean Night, the Catalyst Literary Arts Magazine and beach drum circles to exist. The magic of being a student at UCSB is that the wise are able to benefit from three interlocking environments: red-cup atmosphere, reputable research and a music scene that never stops playing.</p>\n<p>Enter Sarah LaForge, a UCSB alumnae from 2011.

As a senior, she landed a research assistant position in the Psych Department.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Sarah was great to work with . . . a bright, inquisitive research assistant. I always looked forward to working with her,” said Kim Hartson, a graduate student advised by Psychology Professor David Sherman. “Sarah conducted a number of studies with me, including her URCA project looking at whether listening to heart sounds reduced physiological stress and improved performance.”</p>\n<p>Like a true Gaucho, being an R.A. wasn’t LaForge’s only extra-curricular activity. The UCSB alumnae’s senior year was a mix of being president of Manley Co-op, working on a senior’s thesis and playing music, among other things. “Music became a hobby my senior year at UC Santa Barbara,” said LaForge. “Through the drum circles on the beach [and] the noon Storke shows, there’s such a good music community in Isla Vista. It became a side project along with all this work I was doing to graduate.”</p>\n<p>Upon graduation in 2011, LaForge headed straight into the career world, going into social work for disabled and autistic children in Riverside, California. “It was overwhelming . . . it was so hard on me emotionally that I felt like I had no outlet at the end of the day. I was so worried all the time about these kids,” she said.</p>\n<p>Facilitating her hobby found at UCSB, LaForge ended her social work term and moved to L.A. to write music. Taking on the stage name of “Lucy,” she formed “Lucy &amp; La Mer” in 2012 as a solo act. Other musicians have been added into the mix in the last couple of years, including Grammy-nominated drummer Matt Cook and bassist Jon Lee Keenan. Lucy &amp; La Mer has played in 10 countries throughout Europe and recently just finished a San Diego to Seattle tour with Australian musician Dolly Denko.</p>\n<p>Throughout it all, she’s kept in contact with her mentors at UCSB, and even played at Hartson’s wedding. “I remember my fiancé at the time and I were talking about potentially having a band play at our wedding and Sarah had just posted a new song on Facebook so I sent him a link to her music and he liked it,” said Hartson.</p>\n<p>“It just so happened that Sarah was playing a show in L.A. that weekend so we drove down to see what she was like live and we loved it. I remember asking her at the end of the set to play our wedding and she was excited to do so and we were thrilled. It was really lovely to have such a personal connection to the band playing the wedding. It wasn’t just hiring some random band and we knew we could count on her to really make the wedding special and she did.”</p>\n<p>Besides performing at weddings for good friends, LaForge funds her traveling adventures by hosting amateur music lessons for small children. “In L.A. there’s a lot of parents who want their toddlers taught what music is. I bring fun percussionist instruments, teach them a few chords, and say, ‘hey let’s write a song together.’” She also recently landed a spot as backup singer for 49-year old EDM legend Moby.</p>\n<p>While her life is very different from the days at UCSB testing heart sounds, LaForge hasn’t lost the affinity for study she gained in her degree. In an interview with UCSB’s psych department newsletter, she said, “There’s a surprising amount of research within the music business. Finding your audience is just like finding your sample group – age, location, interest, disinterests, are all important when creating marketing strategies. You’re always hypothesizing about how your group will react and asking questions as you plan.”</p>\n<p>LaForge’s future plans involve combining her UCSB Psychology degree with her passion and training to become a music therapist. But for now, she’s enjoying the hectic lifestyle as a freelance teacher and musician-on-the-road.</p>\n<p>“After you stop school, you’re looking for something [to do]. I don’t have a test Friday, so what am I looking towards, what do I wanna work on. Music became that,” said LaForge. “You never feel balanced, necessarily. But you feel thriving. You’re doing a million things at once, you’re juggling. It’s not as structured as being in school or having a 9-5 job. But I love it.”</p>\n<p>Thriving is the optimum word to describe Sarah LaForge; a UCSB student whose top-notch education and unique environment cultivated her into a singer-songwriter with a research-savvy edge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>To get into contact with Sarah LaForge, go to</em> facebook.com/lucyandlamer</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Just Friends (Single) by Lucy &amp;

Lectures hosted 2014 Nobel Peace laureate, women’s education activist and international bestselling author Malala Yousafzai at a sold-out event on June 27 at the Arlington Theatre, with simulcasts at Campbell Hall and The New Vic.</p>\n<p>Seventeen-year-old Yousafzai grew up in Pakistan’s formerly Taliban-controlled Swat Valley where she advocated for women’s education after the Taliban declared no girls would be allowed to attend school. In response, a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012. Having made a full recovery, she now continues her secondary education and activism in the United Kingdom. In October 2014, Yousafzai became the youngest Nobel laureate in history.</p>\n<p>The event consisted of a short explanation my Yousafzai regarding her life and activism, followed by a discussion and Q&amp;A session moderated by event sponsor and Malala Foundation board member Susan McCaw. McCaw presented questions pre-submitted by students at UCSB, Santa Barbara Middle School, Montecito Union Elementary and Harding University Partnership School.</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said the Swat Valley was “paradise” before the Taliban took control, but terrorism brought “darkness” to her community.</p>\n<p>“My life was a happy life and, suddenly, things changed,” Yousafzai said. “A villain came. This villain in our story was terrorism — Talibanization. Our peaceful valley turned from a place of tourism to a place of terrorism. More than 400 schools were destroyed at that time. People were flogged, killed; women were not allowed to go outside, girls’ education was banned and life became so hard.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said her father allowed her to go to school even though most girls in the Swat Valley did not, providing her with the foundation that allows her to advocate for fair treatment and education for women.</p>\n<p>“He treated me equally as my brothers,” Yousafzai said. “He allowed me to get education, and I was one of the luckiest girls who got this opportunity … He believed that if we want our society to go forward, if we want our country to succeed, we need to empower women.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she has fought for her own education and universal women’s education because it leads to individual empowerment.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, in a patriarchal society, women lack identity,” Yousafzai said. “They are wives, sisters, mothers, but they are never allowed to have the identity of an individual. I did not want to suffer through the situation of being only called the wife or the mother to someone.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she is “not a lone voice” in her advocacy for women’s education, because she represents all those who are denied the opportunities she seeks to create.</p>\n<p>“When I go and see presidents and prime ministers I say, ‘don’t think this is only this one girl, Malala, speaking to you, these are the girls in Nigeria, these are the girls in Kenya who do not get the opportunity to get their secondary school education,’” Yousafzai said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Effie Sklavenitis said the event taught her the importance of speaking on behalf of others to create change.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a voice, and just because you’re one person doesn’t mean you’re alone. It means that you have to speak up if you want things to change.” Sklavenitis said. “Even when people speak up against you, you still have to keep on talking and keep on expressing your points.”</p>\n<p>Yousafzai said she sees many students in countries with universal education who do not value and take advantage of their opportunities.</p>\n<p>“It’s really sad because, one side of the world, children are fighting, children are struggling for the right to go to school … even if they have to pay, even if they have to travel long distances, even if they have to face the difficulty of having no teachers or sitting in a classroom with 90 to 100 students,” Yousafzai said. “I think all the children who have this opportunity should be very thankful.”</p>\n<p>Third-year geology major Cassidy Meehan said the event prompted her to realize the value of the education she continues to receive.</p>\n<p>“It really made me feel inspired to take advantage of my education,” Meehan said. “It really made me realize, ‘wow, I’m really lucky to have this.’”</p>\n<p>According to Yousafzai, cultures that do not allow for or support women’s education can and should be changed.</p>\n<p>“These cultures and traditions, they are not sent by God from the sky and said that this is your culture and you have to follow it,” Yousafzai said. “It is we people who have made these cultures, and we have the right and duty to change them when they go against basic human rights.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and marine biology double major Francesca Pezzullo said she agreed with Yousafzai that culture should not inhibit human rights.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really interesting to say that we can change our culture, we can change our traditions,” Pezzullo said. “It’s not a good thing to hold on to if it’s impeding on people’s human rights. It’s very important for people to understand that you can’t just hold onto it because it’s familiar. That doesn’t mean it’s right.”</p>\n<p>Pezzullo said the event showed her, despite Yousafzai’s influence and achievements, that the activist is also a “very normal” teenage girl.</p>\n<p>“She seemed like a very genuine person,” Pezzullo said. “She’s exceptional in her situation, but she seems like a down-to-earth person.”</p>\n<p>Sklavenitis said the event inspired her to consider how students’ actions in the United States affect the fight for basic human rights in other parts of the world.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for people to think about their own societies and their own actions every day and how that affects the bigger picture and how that affects anything from women’s rights to education for children, because everything is connected,” Sklavenitis said. “We may live in different places, but at the end of they day we live on the same planet.”</p>\n<p>Pezzullo said Yousafzai’s story demonstrates the effect one activist can have on an issue.</p>\n<p>“You have to be the one to see the change that you want to see happen, which is something that is hard for people to wrap their heads around because they feel like their life is so important personally, they don’t realize you have to actually do it yourself,” Pezzullo said. “Malala is a girl who just did it herself.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

tuition.</p></div>\n<p>The tuition increase plan will be discussed at the UC Board of Regents’ meeting on Nov. 18-20 at UC San Francisco Mission Bay and aims to stabilize tuition and fees, according to a UC statement released this past Thursday. According to the UCSA petition, the association will “actively lobby” UCOP and the Board of Regents, will write letters to Senators and Congressmen “expressing the resolution’s sentiments” and will conduct a system-wide survey to gather input about President Barack Obama’s “Plan to Make College More Affordable” and university rating system, and relay the feedback to the US Department of Education.</p>\n<p>UCOP spokesperson Brooke Converse said the UC would work to minimize the increase in tuition by seeking additional funds from the state.</p>\n<p>“We are aware of the petition,” Converse said. “No one likes a tuition increase, least of all the University, but we hope to work with students to advocate for additional funding from the state to offset the potential increase.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Despite state funding increasing over the last two years, the UC still faces a long-term gap between projected revenues and its basic funding needs for educational programs.</p>\n<p>The UC still remains $460 million below its 2007–‘08 level of state funding, and is below what it needs to continue to meet its commitment to admitting all eligible California students and to “preserve the quality of a UC education,” according to the UC statement released last week.</p>\n<p>The UC also stated that additional state funding could allow UC to avoid a tuition increase.</p>\n<p>According to first-year pre-biology student Ashley Tringali, paying more tuition right now is justified and will likely pay off later on.</p>\n<p>“I have been reading articles about the changes that they want to make and I feel like right now we might have to pay more, but I am investing my money into a good education and hopefully I’ll be able to use that education,” Tringali said.</p>\n<p>However, first-year economics and global studies double major Kayla Saliba said she agrees with UCSA’s petition to put financial responsibility onto the state.</p>\n<p>“The state should not be cutting the money. But if that is not an option, then if you are cutting the funds that the school is getting, what is going to happen to the school?” Saliba said. “Already students and teachers are scrambling for resources. How are we going to pay for things that the university needs?”</p>\n<p>Tringali said increasing tuition to improve the UC is a worthwhile investment.</p>\n<p>“I know the UCs … and especially here at UC Santa Barbara, we have great research and opportunities and connections,” Tringali said. “I feel like if I need to pay more now, yeah it might be bad financially for me right now, but I know it is going to pay off later. I am totally fine with investing in my future.”</p>\n<p>But according to Saliba, the state is obliged to provide affordable education for their public universities.</p>\n<p>“We should be getting more money, but it should not be coming from the students,” Saliba said, “it should be coming from the government, and that is a basic thing I feel we need to start doing as a nation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58092\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/ucsa-petitions-prospective-rise-in-tuition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58092\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/ucsa-petitions-prospective-rise-in-tuition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/ucsa-petitions-prospective-rise-in-tuition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/ucsa-petitions-prospective-rise-in-tuition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/ucsa-petitions-prospective-rise-in-tuition/","id":3443,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[3442,3441,3440],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
