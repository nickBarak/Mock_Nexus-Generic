She emphasized that her appointment will focus on creating a transparent system to address Title IX reports.</p>\n<p>She and UC President Janet Napolitano will be working together closely, according to a press release from the UCOP.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the Nexus, Salvaty said, “I think that the president’s recommendations, those that she’s adopted, are right on … I think we share the same goal, which is to improve accountability and fairness and transparency.”</p>\n<p>The recommendations, which are available on the UC website and are approved by UC President Napolitano, outline plans to make examining Title IX cases uniform.</p>\n<p>The document lists the creation of a proper investigation method for matters of sexual violence and sexual harassment. It states that Title IX will create “clear time frames” so that investigations take no longer than three months and adjudication takes no longer than two months unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”</p>\n<p>In reference to the implementation of uniform Title IX procedures, Salvaty acknowledged that the challenge in creating consistent processes will be respecting the unique qualities of each campus.</p>\n<p>“I think the consistent challenge, certainly in the context of our students, is trying to implement a fair process that all the students understand, that they feel comfortable accessing if that’s their choice,” Salvaty said.</p>\n<p>The UC’s recommendations insist on uniform procedures for handling Title IX cases, which Salvaty said are meant to create an equitable way of handling cases.</p>\n<p>“We are one system, we are one UC, and certainly the president and I would want all our students to experience the most fair process that we can build,” Salvaty said.</p>\n<p>“A key to that would be that that process looks the same on every campus,” she added. “It wouldn’t be fair if a student at UC San Diego experienced the Title IX process totally different than a student at Santa Cruz.”</p>\n<p>As a new presidency brings changes to federal administration, there is uncertainty whether the Obama administration’s interpretation of Title IX will be upheld. The current standard relies on the relatively lenient “preponderance of evidence,” 50.1 percent chance that the accused is responsible.</p>\n<p>In response to these changes, Salvaty says that the “obligation to take care of our students remains,” regardless of new administration.</p>\n<p>“I think we all agree that no one wants their students experiencing sexual violence. The question is: How do we build a fair process where we can ensure that we’re taking care of all of our students?” she said. “I don’t see the incoming administration changing … that fundamental obligation that the universities have.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Sept. 28 a bill that eliminates the statute of limitations for rape and related offenses.</p>\n<p>The Justice for Victims Act (Senate Bill 813), authored by Sen. Connie M. Levya, ensures an indefinite time limit for the prosecution of sex offenses such as rape.</p>\n<p>Previous California legislation required rape cases to be prosecuted within ten years of the alleged crime, unless new DNA evidence surfaced after the ten-year limit. This ten-year time limit is known as a statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>Levya said the bill will allow victims to pursue justice whenever they feel ready to come forward, as victims often take time to process trauma and gather courage before approaching law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Survivors of sexual assault should always have the ability to seek justice in a court of law, even years after the alleged crime was committed,” Levya said in a press statement. The bill, Levya said, will “help to ensure that rapists and sexual predators are not able to evade justice simply because of a shortened statute of limitations.”</p>\n<p>The bill is linked to the sexual assault allegations against comedian Bill Cosby, who has been accused of committing a variety of sex offense by over 60 women.</p>\n<p>Several of Cosby’s alleged victims testified in favor of the bill at legislative hearings and press conferences.</p>\n<p>Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Cosby’s accusers, said that California’s statute of limitations prevented her clients from having their cases heard.</p>\n<p>“It was too late for California prosecutors to file a case even if they concluded that they had sufficient evidence to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt,” Allred said of Cosby’s alleged victims in a press statement. “Even though it was too late for these accusers, we decided that we should work to change the law to help others.”</p>\n<p>For many anti-rape advocates, the bill is an important milestone; it was signed just four weeks after the early release of Stanford swimmer Brock Turner, who was convicted on three counts of sexual assault, and is one of several bills introduced in the California legislature addressing rape and sexual assault.</p>\n<p>However, the elimination of the statute of limitations has raised concerns as well. Charles Anderson, law professor at UCLA School of Law and former criminal defense practitioner, said that eliminating the statute of limitations could lead to a wider margin of error when prosecuting rape cases over ten years after the alleged crimes.</p>\n<p>“The more that time passes, the greater the likelihood an unjust outcome may be reached,” Anderson said in an email.</p>\n<p>“There is an increased danger that a person who reports being a sexual assault victim after so many years may have a distorted memory of the event.”</p>\n<p>Such “unjust outcomes” may include wrongful convictions of rape, as was the case with former football player Brian Banks. Banks served five years in prison before it was found that the alleged victim had fabricated her story and Banks’s conviction was overturned.</p>\n<p>Despite these potential consequences, the Justice for Victims Act was passed with bipartisan support as Cosby’s allegations became a hot-button issue. According to Anderson, the bill “would not be happening right now if it were not for the Cosby case.”</p>\n<p>However, Cosby and other alleged sexual offenders will not be tried for cases whose statutes of limitations are already expired. The Justice for Victims Act will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2017 and does not apply retroactively.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72927\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/statute-of-limitations-to-end-for-rape-related-cases-new-law-says/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72927\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/statute-of-limitations-to-end-for-rape-related-cases-new-law-says/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/statute-of-limitations-to-end-for-rape-related-cases-new-law-says/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/statute-of-limitations-to-end-for-rape-related-cases-new-law-says/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/statute-of-limitations-to-end-for-rape-related-cases-new-law-says/","id":3599,"author":{"id":365,"name":"Dana Dela Cruz"},"related":[3598,3597,3596],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brown: More Funding, Less Aid in the UCs","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tuition-Hike-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tuition-Hike-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gov.

The state would provide a total of $8.4 billion to the UC system in the 2017-18 fiscal year, if the state legislature accepts Brown’s proposal.</p>\n<p>The funding increase reflects a negotiation reached between Brown and Napolitano in May 2015. In the midst of violent student protests, the two agreed to freeze tuition on the contention that the state provide a four percent increase in funding for the next four years. Brown and Napolitano also agreed in May 2015 that the UC would propose a tuition hike no greater than the rate of inflation for the 2017-18 academic year.</p>\n<p>Keeping her end of the bargain, Napolitano proposed last week to raise tuition by 2.5 percent for the 2017-18 academic year, which could be the first tuition hike since 2011. In-state tuition has remained at $11,220 since the 2011-12 academic year, and this proposed hike will increase tuition by $282.</p>\n<p>Anticipating the agreed-upon 2017-18 tuition hike, the UC Regents planned to lay the groundwork for a tuition hike proposal during their November meeting at San Francisco, but the discussion was tabled in the face of student protests.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano held a conference call last Friday with student journalists, during which she addressed the proposed tuition hikes, amongst other matters.</p>\n<p>“In any event, I’m with students that tuition needs to be as low as possible,” Napolitano said in the call. “It also needs to be predictable, and we need to have generous financial aid to help those students from lower-income households. That is what we are striving mightily to do.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74741\" style=\"width: 1017px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74741\" data-attachment-id=\"74741\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/uc-regents-meeting-at-ucsf-mission-bay-by-kenneth-song_for-11-20-2014-8183-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?fit=1007%2C734&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1007,734\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"uc-regents-meeting-at-ucsf-mission-bay-by-kenneth-song_for-11-20-2014-8183\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?fit=250%2C182&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?fit=888%2C647&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74741\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/UC-Regents-meeting-at-UCSF-Mission-Bay-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.20.2014-8183.jpg?resize=888%2C647\" alt=\"UCPD officers escort 21-year old UC Berkeley student Jeff Noven through the shattered glass entrance of the UCSF Mission Bay lobby.

An increase in tuition also means an increase in Cal Grants, she said, so low-income students will be able to receive more financial aid.</p>\n<p>Also during the conference call, UC Office of the President (UCOP) spokesperson Dianne Klein said financial aid covers more than just tuition; it covers other “educational expenses” such as housing, transportation and food. She echoed Napolitano in saying the proposed tuition hikes could “provide more resources” to low-income students.</p>\n<p>“It may sound counterintuitive, but the lowest-income students are really going to end up better off because they will receive more financial aid,” Klein said.</p>\n<p>Despite this potential increase in financial aid, Brown’s budget proposal also included a phase-out of the UC Middle Class Scholarship (MCS) program, which provides financial aid to students with family incomes of under $156,000. Students currently receiving such aid would get to keep it in the next academic year, but Brown proposes the UC no longer award the scholarship.</p>\n<p>In a press release Tuesday, Speaker of the Assembly Anthony Rendon dissented to both the proposed tuition hike and the proposal to eliminate the MCS program, which could increase the cost of attending a UC by up to $20,000, he said. Rendon did, however, support increase in UC funds, calling it “good” that higher education receive a “modest funding increase.”</p>\n<p>“We must work to keep college affordable for California students, and I will not support burdening them with higher fees and greater student debt — whether that’s done by raising tuition or phasing out the Middle Class Scholarship,” he said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Regents will discuss tuition hikes at their next meeting on Jan. 25 in San Francisco. Brown will submit a revised budget proposal for the state legislature to vote on in May.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of th</em>e Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74803\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74803\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/brown-more-funding-less-aid-in-the-ucs/","id":3600,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3599,3598,3597],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
