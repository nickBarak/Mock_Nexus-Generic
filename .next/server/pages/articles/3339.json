The reason is simple: athletes don’t want to go play at a university where they won’t be competing for championships and garnering the exposure needed to reach the pro level.</p>\n<p>To turn around a program requires effort, dedication, money, but most importantly, it requires instilling a culture. Usually a program needs to instill a new culture to bring back a sense of attitude, and a new fire to show recruits that this will become a winning program.</p>\n<p>The UCSB baseball program is something that definitely needed a culture change back in 2011 when it was looking for a new head coach after the departure of Bob Brontsema who is still at UCSB, now serving as the assistant athletic director.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brontsema was a great coach as he attained the most wins in school history (483) after an illustrious 18-year career in which he also finished with the third best winning percentage (.503) in school history.</p>\n<p>Although Brontsema was a solid coach during his tenure, it was clear that after a 10-year hiatus from reaching a NCAA regional and not having won a Big West championship during his run, it was time for a change.</p>\n<p>At the same time, however, a young, eager assistant coach awaited his coaching opportunity located in Oregon. A man who was renowned as one of the best pitching coaches in the entire nation as well as a great recruiter. His name is Andrew Checketts.</p>\n<p>Checketts was no stranger to California or the Big West conference as he coached at UC Riverside for four years prior to becoming an assistant coach at Oregon. He knew about UCSB, and once he heard about the vacancy, he held hope that maybe he would get that call so he could finally become a head coach for the first time in his career.</p>\n<p>“When I heard the job become available I thought ‘I’d love to live in Santa Barbara and coach there,’” Checketts said. “That same day I went on a walk with my wife and kids, and, I’m not kidding, I got that call. At first I thought it was too good to be true so I sent it to voicemail, but when I check it later that day it was the AD [athletic director] asking me if I was interested and, of course, I was.”</p>\n<p>On June 22, 2011, UCSB announced that Andrew Checketts would become the ninth head coach in program history.</p>\n<p>Checketts knew the expectations of UCSB’s program and was more than ready to bring a new culture to the university’s ball club — something he has definitely instilled in the short five years he has been here.</p>\n<p>In his first season as the baseball coach, Checketts had 16 seniors on his squad to help make his transition a bit easier and managed to hire the right assistant coaches in play.</p>\n<p>“I knew the first thing any good head coach needs is a great staff, so the first person I got was [Eddie} Cornejo and he has been great,” Checketts said. “We assembled the best staff we could and quickly started trying to figure out what we wanted and how we wanted it done.”</p>\n<p>During his first campaign, the former Oregon State High School Player of the Year impressed everyone as he had the most wins by a first-year head coach in school history with 28. Checketts, who also serves as the teams pitching coach, had a historic throwing rotation that combined for a program best 451 strikeouts on the season.</p>\n<p>Although it was yet another year, the Gauchos did not go to an NCAA regional; everyone knew that the future looked bright. However, Checketts knew that the future would only be bright if he brought in a great group of recruits.</p>\n<p>Although money might have been tight at times, Checketts saw the potential UCSB had to offer young student athletes and began working his recruiting magic right away. In 2012, Checketts held the 18th best recruiting class — the best in school history to this day — 39th in 2013 and 32nd in 2014 all according to <em>Perfect Game</em>.</p>\n<p>“I think kids want to come to UCSB,” Checketts said. “It has unbelievable academics, great baseball weather and amazing location. I think this is one of the best places to go to school on the earth so it makes my job easier.”</p>\n<p>Since that first year in 2012, every year has been an improvement for the UCSB baseball team. The following year in 2013, the Gauchos broke their postseason curse and reached their first NCAA regional for the first time in 12 years, ending its last 22 games with a 16-6 record along with winning six consecutive series to enter the postseason with a 35-25 record.</p>\n<p>In 2014, although Santa Barbara did not make a regional, it posted more than 30 wins for the second straight season, making Checketts just the second head coach in program history to have back-to-back 30-plus win seasons.</p>\n<p>Finally, last year the team achieved a landmark milestone as the impact of the 2012 and 2013 recruiting classes reached their peak, and the Gauchos had arguably the best season in school history after going 40-17-1 to set a new record in most wins against a D1 schools. That season, Santa Barbara was selected to host the South region as the No. 1 seed in the 2015 NCAA Regionals for the first time in program history.</p>\n<p>Although it did not make it out of the first round last year, there is no doubt that the UCSB baseball team has the most significant piece it needs to eventually make a run at the College World Series: A head coach.</p>\n<p>Since his arrival in 2011, Checketts has made significant impact as the programs winning percentage has gone from .500 to .702. He has also played a major role in the pitching department as the programs’ career ERA has made a significant drop from 4.14 in 2012 to 2.45 in 2015.</p>\n<p>Checketts 137-87-1 overall record during his first four full years of coaching currently places him as the Gauchos’ leader in career overall winning percentage (.612) and career conference winning percentage (.556).</p>\n<p>This season the UCSB baseball team is still making noise as it again already registered more than 30 wins on the season and enjoyed the success of breaking a 30-year old school record in consecutive home wins, which is now at 17.</p>\n<p>Even with all this success, Checketts’ humble persona reminds him constantly he could not have done this without his predecessors. He also knows there is still much more work to be done.</p>\n<p>“You know I haven’t really looked up yet,” Checketts said. “We still haven’t won a championship and we still have a lot of work to do, so me and my staff just keep working hard to reach that goal. They deserve a bunch of credit because the continuity of this staff has certainly helped me grow a lot.”</p>\n<p>However, just because coach Checketts cannot truly accept all the praise he deserves, there are certainly no lack of people willing to give him said praise for all the incredible work he has done here at UCSB including his own players.</p>\n<p>“He has made me a more mature person and a better ball player,” redshirt sophomore infielder J.J. Muno said. “I knew he was a good coach, and he had an amazing staff and he was going to take this program to new places and I wanted to be apart of it.”</p>\n<p>“He always pushes me to be a better and better player and I will always be thankful for that.” sophomore first baseman Austin Bush added. “He knows how to push you to your limits and I love that.”</p>\n<p>Changing the culture at UCSB has been a successful endeavor so far but it is not over yet and Checketts is committed for the ride after signing a contract extension through 2020.</p>\n<p>“Nothing great is ever easy and instilling this culture has not been an easy thing. It has taken away time from my wife and kids but luckily I have the best wife who continues to push me,” Checketts said. “But I am dedicated to this program and passionate about Gaucho baseball and I am here for the long haul.”</p>\n<p>Certainly turning around a program is no easy feat, but it certainly is a rewarding one. To know that the time and effort put in to changing a culture has not been a waste certainly must be fulfilling if nothing else. And there is no doubt that newer recruits are seeing the culture change at Santa Barbara and want to come here to be a part of something special.</p>\n<p>Andrew Checketts has been a tremendous coach for UCSB and hopefully he stays at UCSB until he retires.

They drew feedback from students in order to figure out what undergraduates wanted to prioritize in the broad subject of human sexuality, whether it be sociology, relationships, sexually transmitted diseases or the physiology and anatomy of the human sexual response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Initially, we had some dead ends as we stumbled around, trying to figure out what to do. Eventually we came up with a questionnaire where [in] the last lecture every quarter, we would ask, ‘What would you like us to expand? What would you like to shrink down?’ Eventually everything started to stabilize out,” John said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout this process, Soc 152A evolved to more heavily emphasize the subject of sexual health and the sociology of healthy relationships, while putting less time into anthropology and general biology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students] aren’t that interested in sexual variations across different cultures,” Janice explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We personally thought the stuff was fascinating. We read so many studies in anthropology, and thought, ‘Oh my God! They do it so differently!’ I mean, every culture is filled with amazing examples of how different people treat sex and gender across the planet. We just got excited — but the students weren’t that interested,” John said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time in the early ‘70s, Soc 152A also grew into a much larger class, from 100 students to 150, before the Baldwins moved to Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall, teaching 300 students. Then finally, they made the leap to Campbell Hall — with its capability to shine enormous projections of the labia, the vas deferens, ejaculation and the female orgasm — all while lecturing to 600 to 650 students at once.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the decades of teaching the course, some subjects would vary from year to year, finding time in the limelight before dropping completely off the radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are fads, you know. There was a fad of changing the minor lips [of the labia], going through surgery to get them cosmetically changed. Now the big thing is they get implants in your butt. That’s bigger than breast implants,” Janice said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Baldwins’ perspective, having two people onstage in Campbell Hall improves students’ understanding of concepts taught while also preventing students from misinterpreting what any one person says. After all, sexuality is a topic which can spur strong reactions and brings with it some baggage, Janice said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are so many people in the room that are sensitive to this. And I think if John said some of the things he says, and I wasn’t there, people could take it incorrectly,” Janice said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Soc 152A] does cover some delicate topics. We think it’s important to have tools so that people don’t think that John’s teaching this from a male perspective —”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“— or wonder whether Janice is a radical feminist,” John added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those issues don’t come up much when we’re doing it together,” Janice said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even in an era more liberal and open than when the class was initially taught, and even with the advent of the internet and online resources for sex education — which the Baldwins themselves have contributed to — the Baldwins still say there is still a place for Soc 152A.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a lot of people like international students … people from homes in which sex is not talked about, from very conservative backgrounds,” Janice said, adding that “it’s amazing how many people still benefit by taking Soc 152A.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Baldwins also found that in teaching a class like Soc 152A, their own relationship benefits. It has given them the ability to put a name onto all of the different feelings and elements which make up a loving relationship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you can verbalize things, you can plan things out a little bit better and make sure that you’ve got it really as good as you can make it,” John said. “In the old days, 50 years ago, there would have been Freudian speculation about love and relationships because it really wasn’t the science of love.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But now there really is a science of love and relationships.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"><em>Updated 2/14/2020 2:02 p.m. </em></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Food Bank area. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></span></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Basic Needs Resource Center (BNRC) would place various Associated Students (A.S.) resource entities under the purview of the current A.S. Food Bank, which would be renamed to the “A.S. Food Bank and Basic Needs Resource Center” and include the A.S. Food Bank, Child Care Grant, A.S./Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) Emergency Grants, the Community Financial Fund Grant and the Graduate Student Association Food Pantry, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. President Alison Sir began working on the BNRC over the summer along with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So Marisela and I created a proposal this summer when we realized that this $1.2 million from UC Office of the President was going to be sent to each campus, and we decided this would be a great opportunity for A.S. Food Bank,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the opportunity to centralize A.S. basic needs resources, Sir hopes the center will eventually consolidate financial workshops and CalFresh advocates in one place for students to access. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BNRC would not be in a different location but would move into the current A.S. Food Bank area. One key element of the BNRC is a case management system, which would track what students are accessing in order to assess student needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was authored by On-Campus Senator Adalis Rojas and seconded by Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi and calls senators to “support its expansion and work to reach out to the UCSB community about these opportunities,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas’ resolution also addresses a separate A.S. project </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an A.S. book grant, which will provide funding for students to purchase textbooks.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas told her fellow senators during Wednesday’s meeting that this resolution is a way to “centralize what students’ needs are instead of everything being scattered about.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I spoke to Alison and Marisela and we did consider making it two separate resolutions, but they both advised for me to just include it under one, so that’s just how it came out to be,” Rojas said to the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said one of her key senate campaign platforms was textbook affordability, so when  Márquez approached Senate last week about authoring resolutions for the BNRC and the A.S. Book Bank, she decided to write both into one resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do know that food insecurity and textbook affordability is a huge, popular issue among the senators that we all want to solve,” Rojas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution states that the current EOP Emergency Grant can be used for textbooks but only if a textbook has been lost, damaged or stolen </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not in the case of students who cannot afford textbooks at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has not yet announced how the new book grant funds will be allocated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Hadidi referenced last Friday’s Basic Needs Town Hall, held at Corwin Pavilion, where students addressed both campus and local leaders about accessibility to basic resources to combat food insecurity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many students have a lot of issues with what’s going on in their lives on campus. I think there’s a lot of concerns about housing and homelessness for students and right now we can’t address that, so I think supporting this resolution is really important,” Hadidi said to her fellow senators during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has not unveiled a timeline for either the BNRC or the book grant to be set in motion. Currently, Márquez and Sir are working to source more contribution from financial boards for the BNRC and are trying to gain more student support for both of the measures. </span></p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Most notably, they have defeated two of the East’s projected top contenders: the Toronto Raptors (twice this season) and the Boston Celtics.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Prior to its first defeat, the Cavs’ 6-0 start stands as the best team start in LeBron James’s career, having reached the 5-1 mark a total of three times in two consecutive seasons with Miami in 2012 and 2013 in addition to last season with the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>\n<p>The end result of each season that started 5-1? Three NBA championship titles.</p>\n<p>It was the second-best start in franchise history, falling short of the 1976-77 Cavaliers’ 8-0 start.</p>\n<p>Although records don’t tell all about a team, Cleveland’s current squad could be the best team that has ever surrounded James, who is currently in his 10th season with the franchise since returning in 2014.</p>\n<p>Despite still being in his prime, at 31 years old James faces the reality of father time creeping up, considering the retirements of basketball legends Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett this past season and offseason.</p>\n<p>Although the King’s dethronement isn’t expected anytime soon, having recently surpassed NBA Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon for 10th place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list, the Cavaliers’ hometown superstar has about four to six years remaining in his career.</p>\n<p>It is a time span that reinforces the same message since his return to Cleveland: Win now.</p>\n<p>No one can predict what the Cavaliers will become post-LeBron, especially after the additions made in recent years, but it is likely the team will lose its value as a top contender. The immediate decline in wins from 2010-2014, occurring during James’s stint with the Heat, was more than enough evidence that it must build around their star player.</p>\n<p>The first step toward rebuilding during those four seasons was the selection of Kyrie Irving with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>Entering the NBA with a foot injury and offset by other nagging injuries throughout his career, the most significant being his fractured kneecap in game one of the 2015 NBA Finals, Irving slightly became a forgotten cause as a player with the potential to be one of the league’s best point guards.</p>\n<p>Despite Irving earning the 2011-12 Rookie of the Year award and being known for his ability to score, a lack of acknowledgment for his game still remained.</p>\n<p>After LeBron James signed a five-year, $90 million contract extension during the 2014 offseason, his unexpected return that same year has worked in the favor of Irving ever since.</p>\n<p>Playing in just 53 games last season after recovering from the previous year’s knee injury, Irving has excelled, proving his ability to take over on the game’s biggest stage in the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Convincing many that he outplayed the two-time NBA MVP Steph Curry in the series, averaging 27.1 points per game and scoring the game-winning three-point dagger in his face to secure Cleveland’s first-ever title, Irving used the postseason to remind and prove to the world he is one of the league’s best point guards.</p>\n<p>It was obvious then, and it is obvious now that without Irving the Cavaliers cannot win an NBA championship.</p>\n<p>Whenever it seems like the Cavs are down and out on the brink of defeat, it is Irving who has stepped up as the team’s savior when even James wouldn’t be expected to prevail.</p>\n<p>Although other players such as J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert, Channing Frye, Kevin Love and more play pivotal roles in the Cavs’ success as well, the tandem of Irving and James has formulated a one-two punch that is capable of carrying Cleveland to future title victories.</p>\n<p>The pairing of the two has helped reduce the pressures on James and provides Cleveland with an option to stay within winning games as the team’s leader rests.<br>\nFor purposes of rest, James intentionally sat out for the first time this season in the Cavs’ game against the Pacers.</p>\n<p>In addition to scoring the ball well, ranking third in the league in scoring at 109 PPG, Cleveland has remained consistent on defense, allowing 103.5 PPG. Despite the average, the Cavs have allowed 100-plus points in just six of their 11 games this season.</p>\n<p>Although the Golden State Warriors, considered Cleveland’s rival as we anticipate a third-consecutive Finals meeting between the two, are a team capable of going back and forth in a shootout with any team, their occasional lapses on defense detract from their league-leading 117.3 PPG average.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the Warriors are tied for allowing the seventh highest opponent PPG average at 109.3. In comparison to Cleveland’s six games, Golden State has allowed 100-plus points in nine of its 11 games.</p>\n<p>It is true the Warriors are still adjusting to their addition of former NBA MVP Kevin Durant and the departures of primary role players Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut, but Golden State must find a way to resolve its inconsistencies, which mainly fall on it becoming smaller around the key and paint areas.</p>\n<p>One can only hope another Cavs-Warriors championship matchup will take place. After leading in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks in the NBA Finals, if James and co. were able to defeat the self-embraced “Super Villains” of Golden State, he would achieve the ultimate victory that would earn him a nod in surpassing two of the game’s greatest in Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Much is still to occur throughout this season. There will be phases during which Cleveland will look like the best team or falter to its high expectations, preventing the prediction of the Cavs winning it all in 2016-17.</p>\n<p>It’s a game-by-game process in which teams continue to develop, even in the case of the Cleveland Cavaliers heading into year three of James being back at the helm. Their “All In” mentality is a motto that persists in the championship-or-bust expectations that have become standard for fans such as ourselves to judge accordingly.</p>\n<p>All stats are accurate as of Nov. 16.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74298\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74298\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/cavs-remain-nbas-royal-team-with-jamess-and-irvings-guidance/","id":3338,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3337,3336,3335],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
