After multiple attempts, UCSC was not immediately available for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students launched the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) movement in the fall, asking for a proposed monthly stipend of $1,412 to supplement teaching assistants’ (TA) salaries in the face of rising housing prices. Although the movement comes after years of organizing around the issue, UCSC graduate students officially went on a wildcat strike, meaning action without union support, on Dec. 9, 2019. Until now, they have refused to upload grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC Graduate Student Association President </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yulia Gilichinskaya criticized UCSC’s decision to change all missing grades to pass grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The administration has shifted the burden of missing grades from themselves and onto the undergraduates it purports to care for and educate. We cannot allow this,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that some of the students work really hard and really care about getting an A or getting a B. And so taking that away from students who have those grades when we have them, I think is unfair,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In exchange for submitting withheld grades, some graduate students who were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dismissed from TA positions for spring quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be “considered for future appointments,” but Gilichinskaya said there are no guarantees of reinstatement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gilichinskaya</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, over 80 UCSC graduate students withheld grades during Fall Quarter 2019, which jumped to over 100 withholders by the end of Winter Quarter 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, around 80 UCSC graduate students who were dismissed from their spring TA positions are still without work, according to Gilichinskaya.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With UCSC graduate students now submitting grades before May 1, striking UCSB graduate students are the only grade withholders left in the UC system. UCSB </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">went on full strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Feb. 27,  meaning TAs ceased teaching and grading. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 55 UCSB graduate students are currently withholding winter quarter grades, according to Sheila Kulkarni, a chemistry and biochemistry Ph.D. student and the Recording Secretary for the UCSB unit of United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW), the union representing UC teaching assistants, readers and tutors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students are beginning to shift from withholding grades to pushing for UAW’s support in striking against </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/uaw-2865-to-vote-to-strike-over-unfair-practice-charges-against-the-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which are filed to the state when an employer or union violates the National Labor Relations Act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alleging that UAW supported wildcat strike efforts and failed to take action to end the strike, the UC Regents </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a ULP against UAW. Subsequently, UAW </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a> <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ULPs, alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the COLA movement, including failing to negotiate for a COLA with the union while instead bargaining with individual graduate students and groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to the current wildcat COLA strikes, potential backing from UAW in a strike against ULP charges would guarantee protections for striking graduate students, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to a </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/the-next-phase-of-the-cola-struggle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published on April 1 by UCSC COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These protections are necessary certainties in these uncertain times. They will allow us to strike against the university with the full weight of our statewide union behind us,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UAW-sanctioned strike would also shift the burden of withholding grades away from two campuses — UCSC and UCSB — toward a UC-wide approach at the union level by creating a system-wide strike, according to Gilichinskaya.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW’s bargaining team is in the process of obtaining signatures to allow a vote to decide on whether to strike over the ULP grievances. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TAs across the UC system are phone banking to help collect more signatures for the vote and , as of Monday, have obtained</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over 2,300 of the 5,000 in-unit signatures needed, according to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya’s email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya said that grade withholding in future quarters will continue if a ULP strike is to occur, but until then, graduate students are losing their “biggest leverage” in the COLA strikes against UCOP to demand a living wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Grades are what the university cares about. It doesn’t care about the quality of the education. It needs the grades for the bureaucracy to smoothly function,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Gilichinskaya said that due to the coronavirus pandemic — and the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">switch to remote learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that came with it — the COLA movement lost vital momentum that came from in-person picket lines. But she foresees “statewide massive withholding of teaching and grading labor” in the event of a union-sanctioned ULP strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people lost their second and third jobs. A lot of people weren’t as confident that they could risk their employment and their health insurance in the midst of a pandemic,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this leverage sort of didn’t have as much strength just because we didn’t have the numbers at the end of winter quarter.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

While graduate students are currently on a wildcat strike, this action demonstrates that our movement is not only dedicated to achieving fair pay but also to changing the priorities of the public university system to better fit the needs of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> students,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the statement continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most students who entered the building seemed to support the graduate students’ actions. One student, Kayla Katsuda, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, noted that she came for the free lunch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends told me about what was going on, and I came because I don’t have a meal plan,” Katsuda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One UCSB student and Ortega Dining Commons employee explained to the Nexus that he “didn’t know what was going on” at first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They seemed to be letting all people in, and the food is overpriced, so I would agree with that. You could easily go to Isla Vista and get a better meal … so I agree [with the strikes]. The food is very expensive,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB did not respond to requests for comment regarding the Monday occupation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As lunchtime attendees exited Ortega, organizers advertised the ongoing strikes and spoke about how undergraduates can help with the COLA movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re on the picket line outside of Storke Tower from 8 to 5 every day,” one organizer told a student leaving with a to-go plate. “Hope to see you there!” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Ramsey contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

Thursday’s action marked one </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">full week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since UCSB graduate students began striking. COLA organizers across the UC system called for the one-day strike, asking professors to halt lectures, students to walk out of class and for participants to wear black, hence the name “black-out” strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The motto of the UC system is “let there be light,” one speaker said at the Storke Tower noon rally. “When we wear black, it shows the UC administration that without graduate student labor, there is no light.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC-wide work stoppage started early morning on Thursday; at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, protesters blocked all four entrances to Cheadle Hall — UCSB’s administrative building — and stood shoulder-to-shoulder at each entrance. At the front entrance, organizers held a sign that read, “FUCK THE UC! AND A BITCH NAMED JANET.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some administrators who work in Cheadle Hall argued with strikers and attempted to force their way through but were pushed back, sending administrators and staffers circling around the building in hopes of finding another way in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, you guys, I don’t fucking support you. We have to work too,” one employee said to COLA organizers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers continued to refuse to allow administrators to enter into the building, including Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the UC Police Department and administration spoke with protesters, saying they had to move or risk being arrested, organizers regrouped and decided to move inside instead, occupying every floor of the building and chanting, “Don’t cross the picket, don’t be a scab,” to employees as they entered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One undergraduate advisor left his office to explain to strikers that “the students that we see are just as stressed as you are.” After organizers began arguing and chanting — drowning out the advisor</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Ry Brennan, one of COLA’s de-escalators, came to help defuse the situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brennan and the advisor reached a compromise, in which strikers would be alerted to stay quiet should any undergraduates come into the building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After occupying Cheadle Hall for most of the morning, organizers started to gear up for the noon rally. At approximately 11:30 a.m., students and faculty holding “Faculty for COLA” and “You’re gonna have to fire us too, Janet,” banners marched from Cheadle Hall to Storke Tower and met with demonstrators who had been there since 8 a.m. as part of their regularly scheduled strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Storke Tower, UC worker unions and academic associations expressed their solidarity with and support of UCSB’s COLA movement to an animated crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers representing different unions emphasized a message of solidarity between various unions, all fighting for better treatment from the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Colvin, a UCSB groundskeeper and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME) Local 3299 member, noted the similarities between the COLA movement and the labor strikes throughout the country, including AFSCME 3299’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">labor fight over the past few years. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every person in this country deserves that security, and that’s why we won’t stop fighting until we have a job that’s worth having and a way to pay rent. You have our support as workers, and I know not a lot of people [from AFSCME] made it out here today because they’re very busy, but I’ve been talking to them at work and you absolutely have our support,” Colvin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Colvin, Christopher John Newfield, a professor of literature and American studies at UCSB and second vice president of the executive council of the Modern Language Association (MLA) of America, emphasized the MLA’s “unanimous and quite enthusiastic” commitment to support the UC-wide strikers and condemned the termination of UCSC graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 1 p.m., the procession of approximately 3,000 marched to Henley Gate, garnering the attention of those on campus as they passed through the Arbor and University Library. Those in “precarious situations,” such as undocumented or international students, were encouraged to walk by organizers wearing red armbands and caution tape, who were designated de-escalators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Henley Gate, the crowd chanted, “Cops off campus, COLA in our bank accounts,” at cars driving by and police officers monitoring the event. Protesters stayed at the gate for nearly 30 minutes before walking back to Storke, where some remained to complete the daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York University sociology professor Andrew Ross visited Santa Barbara to take part in the strike, praising attendees as a catalyst for social change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Graduate student employees are the true conscience of the academic profession, and COLA strikers are the true conscience of the UAW,” Ross said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one deserves to be paid a poverty wage because they love teaching or because they’re training for a job in an academic profession,” he said. “That is not a principle of fair labor, that is a recipe for exploitation.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi and Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

strike on Feb. 27, halting teaching and grading to advocate for a cost-of-living adjustment. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to submit the withheld grades follows that of striking UC Santa Cruz teaching assistants, who announced they would </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-29/uc-santa-cruz-cola-strikers-to-submit-withheld-fall-and-winter-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submit fall and winter quarter grades</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earlier this week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB teaching assistants started their strike on Feb. 27, halting teaching and grading to advocate for a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), a monthly stipend of $1,807.51 that would be given to all graduate students to alleviate rising housing costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students were the last of any UC campus to continue withholding grades, with UCSC submitting earlier this week and other campuses like UC San Diego and UC Davis having been forced to submit grades in early April by campus administration under threat of disciplinary action. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email stated that the COLA movement at UCSB “has been ignored, disrespected, or patronized by an administration hoping this movement will wither and die” and explained that the Dean of Graduate Division wouldn’t negotiate with them and instead suggested they seek support at Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada was not immediately available for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 50 teaching assistants at UCSB were withholding grades prior to Thursday’s announcement, according to various COLA organizers. Graduate students initially expected this number to be higher, but the coronavirus pandemic and the shift to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meant that teaching assistants who had second and third jobs outside the university were vulnerable to unemployment and were compelled to submit grades to secure their jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without foreclosing the withholding of Spring grades, we have made the difficult decision to end our Winter grade strike, and marshal our full strength behind building a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/uaw-2865-to-vote-to-strike-over-unfair-practice-charges-against-the-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">union-sanctioned unfair labor practice (ULP) strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of February, the UC Regents </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), a charge filed to the state when an employer or union violates the National Labor Relations Act. The Regents alleged that United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW) — the union representing UC teaching assistants, readers and tutors — supported wildcat strikes and failed to take action to end the strike, according to the charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, UAW </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a> <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ULPs against the Regents, alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the COLA movement, such as failing to negotiate for a COLA with the union and instead bargaining with individual graduate students and groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW’s bargaining team is in the process of collecting signatures for a ULP strike, which would be similar in nature to the wildcat strikes — teaching assistants would stop instruction and would withhold grades — but because it would be sanctioned by the union, strikers under UAW are guaranteed protections, according to a </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/the-next-phase-of-the-cola-struggle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published on April 1 by UCSC COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The power to call a strike vote rests with UAW’s bargaining team, and UAW’s Joint Council told the bargaining team that it will recommend a strike vote once its <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ULP_Strike_Pledge\">strike pledge</a> reaches 5,000 signatures. As of Monday, there were about 2,300 in-unit signatures on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strike pledge</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Included in Thursday’s email is a list of </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VZUKer_02918YehKBL7VbQrFyAbuUmEeXN_7-xEq9wc/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from COLA organizers for Chancellor Henry T. Yang and UCSB administration to address, which includes changing working conditions for graduate students under the coronavirus pandemic and greater transparency on how the $25 million in stimulus money allotted to UCSB by the federal government will be used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are “insisting” that some of this money go towards waiving or alleviating rent in UCSB-owned student and family housing, as well as rent assistance for graduate students living off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands also call for a walk-back of all strike-related discipline and a commitment to non-retaliation against all UC wildcats, along with the “reinstatement of </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fired UCSC graduate student workers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for current and future appointments.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In adapting to these circumstances</span><b>, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our refocus on alleviating rent and healthcare burden carries on the philosophical core of the COLA demand: that people deserve access to healthcare, housing, and living wages.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the COLA movement — both at UCSB and UC-wide —  has ceased grade withholding for the time being, organizers are still moving forward with other actions. On Friday, COLA organizers UC-wide held a one-day general strike for International Workers’ Day against unsafe working conditions brought on by the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers also wrote that the movement continues in a variety of formats online, and that it will continue in person once campuses are re-opened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the pandemic passes and our campus reopens (and both these events </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> occur), we do not intend to return to business as usual,” the email read.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/02/2020, 10:05 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that UAW would not vote to strike until they reach 5,000 signatures on their strike pledge.
