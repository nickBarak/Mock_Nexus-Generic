The branch received a grant from the </span><a href=\"https://theharwoodinstitute.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harwood Institute for Public Innovation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the summer 2018 to help gather data on library needs for Zone 4 — </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/rezoning-will-provide-i-v-with-more-library-access/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a library service area that includes Goleta and I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to library technician Marie Crusinberry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re here to have a conversation to better understand your aspirations for the community,” Crusinberry told the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board of Directors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crusinberry began by asking the directors what they would want for I.V., bringing up the idea of a local branch in the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Ethan Bertrand stressed the importance of children’s programs for I.V., along with language access programs, which provide translation and interpretation services, and technology access programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Kristie Nguyen and Board President Spencer Brandt both suggested library service ideas geared toward college students. While Nguyen proposed extended hours at the Goleta Valley Library during exam weeks to give students another study space, Brandt spoke about possibly increasing the number of common college textbooks and course reserves for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Let’s say it’s a biology class or that you’ve got 700 people in this lecture hall. It’d be great to keep some reserves of those types of textbooks and make those accessible to students,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that that really will help in terms of making the project a success by bringing the college students in and having that community atmosphere that’s all inclusive.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice President Robert Geis raised his concerns over the divide between I.V.’s youth and the Goleta Valley Library, citing the physical distance between the two as a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The library’s really important to those young kids, so how do we get either library services here or get [kids to a library]? My idea is to get them to the library,” Geis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crusinberry recommended three possible initiatives to get the I.V. community involved in the Goleta Valley Library: a bookmobile, a branch in I.V. or a direct bus shuttle connecting I.V. and the library.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bookmobile would be able to bring books directly to I.V. This would allow people to check out or return books easily, without having to go to the library — something that Crusinberry suggested when addressing Director Jay Freeman’s idea for a book drop-off in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The library has not had a bookmobile since its former one was sold years ago, according to Crusinberry. However, she says the option has resurfaced and is being discussed again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a library branch in I.V. was highly supported, it was seen as a long-term project with obstacles. Director Bertrand did note that the opening of the Isla Vista Community Center in August might be able to provide a space for library programs but the bookmobile and bus shuttle were seen as more immediate solutions to bring library services into I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board seemed to favor a direct bus shuttle from I.V. to the library in collaboration with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD). Director Bertrand stated that a shuttle to the library will be something he plans to address with SBMTD at a later date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just trying to learn and get information because there has been talk about the underserved in I.V. But we need to understand what that means. You can’t just say, ‘Well, we want a library.’ There’s a lot as far as what you want,” Crusinberry said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to make sure that we have our data that shows what we should be doing with our money that we have.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Since [the Trigo location] doesn’t have air conditioning, our employees will feel much better at the new location.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also noted that in the winter, when it rains more often, his customers didn’t have a place to sit since the current location is limited to outdoor seating. He added that Mojo looks forward to being able to provide indoor seating at the new location.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before setting up shop on Trigo, Wang had been skeptical about the location. “When I first came here, even my employees said, ‘You made a bold move coming into this location.’ I had seen it change hands between 805 Kabob and Café International a couple times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang cited lack of kitchen space at the current location as another important factor in the move. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The space [at the current location] is limited and people are often complaining about us not being able to keep up with their demand. So, moving into a larger space gives us more storage and cooking space to turn over that demand and give customers what they need,” he said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also hopes that being closer to campus and the more popular parts of I.V. will help with business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I’m in I.V.

Sometimes people may feel like Mojo is such a long walk from there, but now, more people will be able to try us since we are closer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had also heard of people having trouble finding the current location and thinks that the newer location will make for easier access, especially because many people “know Ike’s was there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ike’s closed abruptly in April and moved to a new location in downtown Santa Barbara. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/amidst-lawsuit-ikes-moves-to-state-street/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Issues between the sandwich shop and the property manager, Icon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the reported presence of mold at the location, led owner Ike Shehadeh to pack up shop and move to State Street. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the status of the mold, Wang said, “I did follow up with the property owner, and they said the mold situation was resolved.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A representative from Icon Property Management declined to comment on the situation.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Before that frame, UCSB had not registered even one hit, yet it kept swinging away until it worked out for them.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Xavier had an early jump on the Gauchos after scoring two runs in the first inning thanks to RBI singles from sophomore catcher Nate Soria and freshman infielder Chris Givin.</p>\n<p>Then the fourth inning happened and UCSB went off. The frame consisted of two three-run home runs courtesy of sophomores Clay Fisher and Austin Bush. Bush is currently riding a hot streak of hitting a home run in each of the last three games. The Gauchos also scored thanks to RBI singles from sophomore first baseman Kyle Plantier and redshirt junior center fielder Andrew Calica. An error by Xavier also led to one run for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Fisher, Calica and Bush all had solid games with each registering three hits and combining for nine RBI’s. Plantier and redshirt sophomore JJ Muno had two hits apiece and one RBI to contribute to the rout.</p>\n<p>After the nine-run frame, Santa Barbara was up 9-2. The Musketeers retaliated with one run in the bottom half of the inning to make it 9-3 but the damage was done and one team was in clear control.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos scored at least one run in four of the next five innings to seal the deal and defeat the Musketeers 14-5 in order to advance to the Super Regionals for the first time in program history.</p>\n<p>Fisher, Bush, Calica and redshirt senior Justin Kelly were all named to the Nashville Regional All-Tournament Team with Bush being named the Tournament MVP.</p>\n<p>All players had great performances as Fisher went 7-15 (.467) with seven RBI’s, Calica went 6-13 with four runs, Kelly pitched a four-inning shutout with 10 strikeouts to secure the Gauchos first win against Xavier and Bush hit three home runs including a walk-off in the opening match against Washington.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s postseason campaign so far has been the best in school history, as the three wins in this regional alone are as many as they had in its past seven trips combined.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara now focuses its attention to Louisville, the winner of the Louisville Regional, a team that has won 50 games this season and finished ranked fourth in the country.</p>\n<p>While it will not be easy to face such a tough opponent, the Gauchos have proven that they are a team that will do whatever it takes to win a ball game, and that is the beauty of this young team.</p>\n<p>Currently, UCSB is the only remaining Big West team in the tournament, and it deserves it after sweeping through the Nashville Regional. This team has come a long way but it is nowhere near satisfied until it reaches Omaha.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game will be against Louisville in the Super Regionals at Louisville Slugger Field on Saturday, June 11 at 9 a.m. PDT.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
