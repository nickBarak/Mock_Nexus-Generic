He provided a lot of energy to start off the game however, fighting for position and rebounding the ball while making the extra pass, which was enough to get by as Heidegger came out and took over the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Heidegger jumpstarted the Gaucho offense with his aggressiveness in the first quarter, scoring the team’s first seven points, tying his points per game average of last year in the first two minutes of the game. This gave UCSB an early 7-3 lead.</p>\n<p>His great three point shooting paved the way for the team’s forwards and remaining guards to slash to the paint, and played a huge role in the 46-29 lead the Gauchos took into the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played great basketball in the first twenty minutes. Having the focus to limit turnovers in an exhibition game is very difficult to do, and going into halftime the players had not only been very stingy with turnovers (coughing up 4 to Fresno’s 13) but also managed to shake the rust off and shoot 52.6 % from the field.</p>\n<p>Other notable events that happened in the first half were the first points of the year for both Marcus Jackson and Gabe Vincent. Vincent getting a steal and layup in the first five minutes of the game was surely a heartwarming sight for many fans after his season ending knee injury last year.</p>\n<p>The senior, who despite missing the last eight games of the season still led the team in points (295) and points per game (14.8), is surely looking to make his presence be felt once again as one of the top players in the Big West this year.</p>\n<p>Marcus Jackson made his swiss army knife status be known early in this game, recording a steal, rebound, assist, and layup all in the first two minutes of the game. The Rice University transfer looks to bring a veteran mentality to the team, as he already had one of the most accomplished careers at his previous school.</p>\n<p>He finished the first half with 12 points on 5-9 shooting, and didn’t need to play much of the second half because of the gap that he helped create.</p>\n<p>The second half mostly consisted of building on the already expansive lead for UCSB. To the team’s credit they did manage to do that, however some of the negative signs of an exhibition game blowout began to seep in as the Gauchos turned the ball over more than twice as many times in the second half as they did in the first (10 to 4).</p>\n<p>Again, it was Heidegger who pulled through for the Gauchos, knocking in 11 second half points and not letting any Fresno Pacific run start.</p>\n<p>Another major contributor in the second half was Clifton Powell, who scored seven points on 2-3 shooting from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>If the sophomore guard is able to continually shoot high percentages from behind the three point line, then his role within the offense should take a big leap from last year, especially because his length and height give him the capability to be one of the most versatile defenders on the team.</p>\n<p>Overall, the exhibition game provided a lot of positives for the Gauchos. Although it was against a clearly under matched opponent, the team was able to incorporate its new players and system very well and look to have a deadly offense going forward.</p>\n<p>Remaining healthy and eligible will surely guarantee a better year than last season, and could lead to the Gauchos making some big strides.</p>\n<p>UCSB kicks off its season in the Thunderdome against North Dakota State on Saturday November 11 at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Things happen, but it’s up to you to push on and in this world, only the strong survive, so that’s something that was instilled in me at a very young age and I’ve stuck with it ever since.”</p>\n<p>Despite the hardship in Underwood’s life, there was one person who continued to push her. And that person was Head Coach Carlene Mitchell.</p>\n<p>“I told her that sometimes I felt basketball had been the easiest thing in her life,” Mitchell said. “I made it extremely hard for her. Once she said she wanted a chance to play at the next level, I knew there was no way I could let her slide by with things that by human nature you would want to with a kid of her background.”</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of her two-year reign in Santa Barbara, Mitchell has been saying that Underwood should average a double-double on the floor every night.</p>\n<p>This season, she basically did.</p>\n<p>Compared to only eight double-doubles in her first three years at UCSB, the senior forward recorded 12 this season, averaging 12.2 points and 9.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“We allowed her to see mismatches and with her athletic ability, there was no reason she couldn’t (average a double-double),” Mitchell said. “I think she started enjoying the fact that when a big shot needed to be made, she was confident enough in herself that she was willing to put that burden on her shoulders.”</p>\n<p>Underwood’s mental toughness clearly translates onto the court. Strength is echoed in Underwood’s play as she emerged as not only a consistent player, but a leader for UCSB this season.</p>\n<p>“She never backs down and she never lets anything get to her,” senior center and co-captain Kirsten Tilleman said. “No matter what goes on on the court, she’s going to be consistently working hard.”</p>\n<p>A team captain, Underwood wears No. 1, taking the number after becoming the first girl from Centennial High to earn a NCAA Division I  basketball scholarship in 20 years. With Underwood as its leader, the team also won its first league championship.</p>\n<p>The number has come to suit the Compton, CA native well as she became UCSB’s leader this season. She was the only player to start in every game this season for the Gauchos and averaged a team-high 33.1 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely good to have that consistent presence,” Tilleman said. “We knew what we were going to get from Sweets every night and that was something we were able to fall back on a lot.”</p>\n<p>Leading the team in points, rebounds and field goal percentage, Underwood becomes the first player to lead the team in all three categories since Jenna Green during the 2006-07 season.</p>\n<p>As a result, the accolades came rolling in for Underwood. She was named to the 2012-13 All-Big West First Team and earned Big West Player of the Week four times, a program record.</p>\n<p>“In the end, she got the ultimate of being recognized by the coaches in this conference as an all-conference player,” Mitchell said. “All the accolades [are] well deserved. She worked hard on her game.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Underwood was crucial in helping the team have an inside presence, allowing the team to play an inside-out game. She could knock down the elbow jumper or post up down low and make the tough layups over bigger defenders.</p>\n<p>Her 12.2 points per game and 48.1 percent shooting from the field ranked eighth and third in the Big West, respectively. She also shot 75.9 percent from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“[As for] scoring, most nights we had to have her on the court to have a chance to win,” Mitchell said. “She has long arms and she’s a quick leaper, so her athleticism kind of countered the fact that she’s undersized. Also, she’s quick on the dribble, so she could face up larger post players and exploit their weaknesses off the dribble.”</p>\n<p>Underwood was just as important on the defensive end, anchoring UCSB’s defense and often making the much-needed plays, whether that was tipping the ball out of bounds with 0.7 seconds remaining to secure UCSB a road victory or grabbing 16 rebounds at Pacific in what was probably the team’s best game of the year.</p>\n<p>Although she measures in at just 6’0’’, Underwood ranked fourth in the Big West in rebounding with 9.2 rebounds per game and first in conference play in defensive boards with 6.8 per contest. Against Northridge Feb. 23, Underwood was all over the glass, tallying a career-high 20 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[Defense was] our team identity. Our mentality was to get stops and a defensive possession isn’t over until you seal that rebound,” Underwood said. “My mentality was to be extremely aggressive on the boards. I wanted that to be my identity.”</p>\n<p>In Underwood’s final game of the year, she recorded another career-high, proving once again she can play through adversity. She exploded for 23 points against San Diego State in the first round of the Women’s National Invitational Tournament, marking the second time she had broken her career-high this season. The game was especially important for Underwood after finishing with a season-low four points in a loss to Cal Poly in the semifinals of the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>“The basketball gods recognized what this kid had given to the program and they gave her a chance to play in postseason play,” Mitchell said. “To be able to look herself in the mirror and look back and be proud because no matter what, you’re human and it’s typically that last game that you’re going to remember, I didn’t want her to have any regrets.”</p>\n<p>The team’s second straight postseason appearance, Underwood went into that game just one point shy of the 1,000-point mark. She became the 24th player in program history to join the 1,000-point club.</p>\n<p>“To be able to reflect on the season and know that I have not one regret, I think I can look at myself and be proud of that,” Underwood said.</p>\n<p>In the face of adversity, both on the court and off, Underwood has certainly proved to be nothing less than a fighter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50753\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/finding-strength-in-the-face-of-adversity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50753\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/finding-strength-in-the-face-of-adversity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/finding-strength-in-the-face-of-adversity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/finding-strength-in-the-face-of-adversity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/finding-strength-in-the-face-of-adversity/","id":632,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[631,630,629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Alumnus Brian Shaw To Coach Denver Nuggets","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Former UCSB basketball legend Brian Shaw was officially named head coach of the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, his first opportunity to lead a team of his own after coaching in the NBA since 2005.

Shaw has experienced tremendous success as both a player and a coach throughout his career and will now take over a promising young Nuggets’ squad that finished third in the Western Conference last season with 57 wins.</p>\n<p>A native of Oakland, CA, Shaw transferred to UCSB after two seasons at Saint Mary’s College and immediately established himself as one of the best ever to don a Gaucho uniform. Shaw played two seasons at UCSB from 1986-1988 garnering All-Big West honors both seasons. In his senior season, Shaw was named Big West Player of the Year and was also an All-American en route to leading UCSB to its first ever NCAA tournament in 1988.</p>\n<p>Shaw impressed scouts during his time at UCSB and was the Boston Celtics first round draft pick (24th overall) in the 1988 NBA Draft. During his 14-year playing career in the NBA, Shaw played both point and shooting guard for seven different teams. His best statistical season came in his second year in the NBA, when Shaw averaged 13.8 points, 7.6 assists and 4.7 rebounds in 79 starts for the Celtics.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Perhaps Shaw’s most memorable moments in the NBA came during his final four seasons in the league, which he spent with the Los Angeles Lakers. Shaw helped the Lakers win three consecutive NBA titles from 2000-2002, playing alongside greats such as Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>\n<p>Aside from his professional career in the NBA, Shaw also won a gold medal at the 1986 FIBA World Championships playing for the US national team.</p>\n<p>Following his retirement from the NBA in 2003, Shaw immediately began to work towards a career as a coach, scouting for the Lakers for a season before becoming an assistant coach for the Lakers from 2005-2011. Shaw won two additional championships as an assistant coach for the Lakers from 2009-2010, bringing his NBA title count to five.</p>\n<p>Before accepting the head coaching job with the Nuggets, Shaw spent the previous two seasons as the associate head coach for the Indiana Pacers and helped develop young players such as Roy Hibbert and Paul George. This past season, Shaw tutored fellow Gaucho Orlando Johnson during Johnson’s rookie season in the NBA in which the Pacers fell to the eventual champion Miami Heat in a seven-game Eastern Conference Finals showdown.</p>\n<p>After 14 seasons as a player and eight seasons as an assistant coach, Shaw will finally get to show the NBA why he has been such a commodity on the coaching market the previous four seasons. Shaw replaces the reigning NBA Coach of the Year in George Karl and inherits a young and talented Nuggets’ roster highlighted by players including Ty Lawson, Kenneth Faried and Andre Iguodala.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best player in UCSB history, Shaw continues to sculpt his basketball legacy and will look to have the same success as a head coach that he has had at every stop throughout his impressive career.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"51736\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-06-26/ucsb-professors-elected-to-join-ecological-society-of-america/shaw-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?fit=520%2C282&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,282\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Shaw 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?fit=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?fit=520%2C282&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-51736\" alt=\"Shaw 2\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?resize=312%2C169\" width=\"312\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?resize=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the June 26th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

While it is extremely easy for Ranadive to look like a fantastic owner after the Capital City watched the Maloof brothers’ deceit and lies for far too long, Ranadive has made a great effort to give Sacramento hope again.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, Ranadive appears to have the opposite persona of the Maloofs. He seems to genuinely care about Sacramento and wants to revive the city. What’s key though, is that Ranadive isn’t just talking; he’s actually putting together a great management team.</p>\n<p>The foundation of any sports franchise is the general manager (GM). Thank goodness for Sac Town that’s a new face. Replacing the outdated Geoff Petrie is Pete D’Alessandro. A former executive for the Denver Nuggets and the Golden State Warriors, D’Alessandro is known for his basketball smarts and communication with other members within the franchise. He realizes that rebuilding the Kings is a process and unlike Petrie, knows that you actually need to have talented players to be a playoff contender.</p>\n<p>For example, D’Alessandro inked DeMarcus Cousins, the face of the Kings, to a four-year extension. He traded Tyreke Evans for Greivis Vasquez to aid Head Coach Michael Malone’s effort in creating an unselfish offense and at this year’s draft, brought in a rookie class that with some work could be important pieces in years to come. D’Alessandro also signed a player he is familiar with in power forward Carl Landry, who helped guide the Warriors to the postseason last year. Also fitting in with Malone’s unselfish style of play is new signing Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, who is a defensive specialist on the wing, an important position in this fast-paced day and age of the NBA.</p>\n<p>Ranadive also hired an advisor to help both himself and D’Alessandro. This advisor just happens to be a big name in the basketball world: Chris Mullin. This Hall of Famer, five-time NBA All-Star and member of the 1992 Dream Team not only knows the game of basketball, but has GM experience with the Warriors.</p>\n<p>Bringing in Mullin shows Ranadive is serious about rebuilding. He’s bringing attention to Sacramento while assuring he has great leaders below him. In other words, he’s not taking the easy way out.</p>\n<p>The last piece to the management puzzle, of course, is the coach. Ranadive chose Warriors assistant Malone, who has made clear that the identity of the Sacramento squad needs a revision. Malone also added former player Dee Brown and fan favorite and former King and fan favorite Corliss Williamson to his coaching staff. Williamson has a chance to be an impactful coach immediately, working with Cousins and the fellow big men down low.</p>\n<p>One thing that has been guaranteed to change under Malone is Sacramento’s defense. Last season, the Kings gave up a dismal 105.1 points per game, the worst in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Despite preaching defense, Malone does want to play fast and use the fast break, which suits the personnel of this young, athletic squad with numerous quick guards. The biggest change on the offensive end, though, should be the mentality. Malone is not going to tolerate selfish play, which is one reason the Kings shipped off Evans in turn for a past first point guard in Vasquez.</p>\n<p>When noticing the background of this staff, Golden State comes up a lot. All have backgrounds with the Warriors; they all know each other, know the game, and as a result, are making the transition much more fluid while committing themselves to Sacramento.</p>\n<p>Then, one extra piece was added to the front office. To die-hard Kings fans it was a shock: Shaquille O’Neal became a new minority owner. There is no introduction needed for the retired Lakers big man in the city of Sacramento, but despite the long-standing hatred toward him, which I don’t see changing no matter what he does, he might be the answer to Sacramento’s prayers.</p>\n<p>For several years now, Cousins has not been reaching his potential. He’s had an attitude. He’s been suspended by the organization. He’s downright underperformed, but with O’Neal as his mentor, Cousins could become the franchise player the Kings need him to be. Plus, O’Neal is a huge name in the basketball world and it doesn’t hurt to bring that kind of attention to Sacramento.</p>\n<p>The Kings rewarded Cousins with a big contract and are heavily relying on him to get his personal orders in check and improve his consistency as a dominating basketball player on a nightly basis. It will be up to Cousins to prove he deserved the extension.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, whether the Kings can snap their seven-year streak without making the postseason is in the hands of the players. They determine the wins and losses. But the look of the Kings in the future and putting the pieces together to return to a playoff contender resides in the hands of the management.</p>\n<p>So far, Sacramento is on the right track.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 2, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52277\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52277\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/","id":634,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[633,632,631],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
