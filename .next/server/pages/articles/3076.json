The Senate was then unable to proceed with the planned discussion of next year’s budget due to the abrupt departure of four senators, which left the Senate without the requisite attendance to vote on agenda items.<br>\nThe meeting was held in the Hub rather than in the Flying A room in order to accommodate the expected audience. While the number of students present did not match the hundreds that attended the previous two meetings dealing with divestment, audience turnout was still much higher than most meetings.<br>\nThe title of the resolution was changed from “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid” to “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from the Military Occupation of Palestine” in an effort to make the rhetoric more neutral.<br>\nCianni said she motioned to remove the agenda item due to the fact that the Senate had already spent two meetings discussing the issue of divestment, and the primary purpose of last night’s meeting was to solicit input from A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions groups on next year’s budget allocations.<br>\nThe dismissal of the resolution left many planned student speakers unable to address the Senate in Public Forum. Pro-divestment audience member and student sponsor of the resolution Katlen Abuata said she felt the removal of the resolution discounted the work Abuata and others had done to take criticisms into account.<br>\n“I think that Senate perpetually silences us as students,” Abuata said. “I think that since we worked hard enough to put up another resolution, we took all of the critiques and concerns that the opposition had in regards to our resolution, and we changed it. We came in here with an open mind willing to work on the resolution in any way possible, and instead they silenced us and they just completely took the resolution off the table without discussion or even thought.”<br>\nAnti-divestment audience member Jake Speyer, who had meant to speak during public forum, supported the senate’s decision.<br>\n“Coming into this meeting, there was a lot of hesitation — I think from both sides, especially since in dealing with the divestment last week, we thought … that divestment was dealt with and that we would be able to work on pro-peace initiatives for the rest of the year,” Speyer said. “I personally am satisfied with the decision of the senate … If [the resolution] was simply brought up, and we decided that our senate doesn’t want to hear it, then that’s absolutely wrong … but it was already dealt with … the revisions that were brought up were also brought up in the last meeting.”<br>\nAfter Cianni’s motion passed, University Owned Senator Miya Sommers motioned to remove On-campus Senator Kevin Rudolph from the meeting, citing his failure to update his office hours on the Senate website as irresponsible. Sommers’ motion failed, at which point she and three other Senators left the meeting. Their absence left the Senate without quorum and unable to vote on other matters, such as the budget. Public Forum continued nonetheless.<br>\nA.S. President Sophia Armen addressed the Senate in Public Forum, expressing her frustration at what had occurred, especially noting what she considered a political use of the budget to undermine the divestment resolution.<br>\n“You all have literally two weeks to look at this budget and I am very frustrated by you using it politically,” Armen said. “This is the entire Association’s futurec … and now what I’m now actually afraid of, is if the possibility that something else could happen next week, we won’t be able to have the discussion that we could have had this week.”<br>\nAssociate Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said senators need to treat each other with kindness and respect.<br>\n“If there is one thing that truly, truly pains me … is to have to watch young people like yourselves be really so mean and so cruel to one each other,” Jones said. “This level of cruelty knows no party lines, no political lines, no religious affiliation, no cultural, ethnic or gender orientation, or any other form of categorization. It is universal, it is coming from all sides, it is multidirectional. And it is truly heartbreaking to watch when you don’t have to do that. You don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>Senators were unable to officially adjourn due to the lack of quorum. Discussion on the budget will continue next week.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/","id":3076,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3075,3074,3073],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard","biography":"Not available","articles":[3010,3012,3020,3021,3027,3029,3038,3040,3043,3050,3058,3060,3061,3071,3072,3074,3076,3078,3079,3081,3085,3087,3089,3092,3098,3102,3104,3106,3107,3108,3109,3111,3112,3113,3115,3116,3117,6138],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Gov. Jerry Brown, UC President Mark Yudof, Board Chair Sherri Lansing and the rest of the Regents were asked by Armen to respond to her by 5 p.m. today.</p>\n<p>According to Armen, there needs to be increased and more open communication between UC regents and students, as past student involvement in the addressing the University’s financial woes has resulted in real change.</p>\n<p>“Especially after the passage of Proposition 30, which can largely be attributed to students getting out the youth vote, for us, as students, to be continually shut out of the decision-­making process is unacceptable,” Armen said in an email. “We are at a historic moment for public higher education in California — for the first time in history students are paying more for their education than their State is…”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Nadim Houssain said demands for a UC Regents meeting on campus would allow students to directly voice their concerns regarding the current state affordability of higher education.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t try to reach out to them, we have no excuse to be frustrated,” Houssain said. “Students will have more access to Regents during the meeting itself … more opportunities to speak during public forum before meetings.”</p>\n<p>While the Regents have been hesitant to transfer their meetings to other locations in the past, Houssain said a UC Regents meeting at UCSB is a “relatively feasible” goal, although there may still be some concern over student protests occurring.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 23rd, 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50991\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-23/a-s-president-invites-uc-board-of-regents-to-host-meeting-at-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50991\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-23/a-s-president-invites-uc-board-of-regents-to-host-meeting-at-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-23/a-s-president-invites-uc-board-of-regents-to-host-meeting-at-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-23/a-s-president-invites-uc-board-of-regents-to-host-meeting-at-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-23/a-s-president-invites-uc-board-of-regents-to-host-meeting-at-ucsb/","id":3073,"author":{"id":195,"name":"Rilla Peng"},"related":[3072,3071,3070],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The ongoing elections process, along with some recently contentious meetings, have contributed to increasingly negative feelings between senators and led speakers to address events and actions that bothered them within the Senate.</p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Kevin Rudolph read a letter during the public forum condemning the actions of another unnamed senator, citing tweets in which the senator allegedly spoke disrespectfully toward colleagues and accused the senator of missing last week’s meeting for campaigning reasons.</p>\n<p>“Senators attacking other senators and posting public statements during the Senate meetings that both undermine and attack the process … should be deemed as unacceptable behavior for an elected official of the student body,” Rudolph said. “I ask if this behavior not changed, that the Internal Vice President puts the Senator’s removal on the agenda.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson addressed the public forum as well, and said such accusations reflected party politics and should be let go.</p>\n<p>“I just feel like we focus on petty stuff so much … and I really hope that we can just move on,” Christianson said. “This is obviously about parties and it happens on both sides, and it’s really stupid.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia also spoke during the public forum and aimed to clear up some accusations that have been made toward executive officers, asking that the senators respect the effort that she puts into her job.</p>\n<p>“Accusations [including] how execs have been spending their money or that the association is corrupt, I personally … hate it, actually, when people are making allegations like that … because I feel like it is undermining the work of the people that have actually been doing really great things,” Segovia said. “I just hold myself to a higher standard, and I hope you all hold me to that standard, too. I hope I’m not failing you.”</p>\n<p>After the tense public forum was over, the senators passed a resolution supporting A.S. President Sophia Armen’s invitation to the UC Regents to hold a regent meeting on the UCSB campus, as well as a resolution to divest from companies that profit from the prison industrial complex.</p>\n<p>Though there was some confusion around a statistic that one senator argued was misleading in the prison divestment resolution, the senators ultimately passed the resolution unanimously.</p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Miya Sommers, who contributed to the resolution, said the prison industrial complex contributes to institutional racism within our society.</p>\n<p>“This is just really important because, again, the prison industrial complex is very disastrous for the functioning of our society,” Sommers said. “People of color are over-incarcerated … and this is, sort of, a new form of racial prejudice.”</p>\n<p>Student sponsor third-year Middle Eastern studies major Hani Tajsar said the incarceration statistics themselves show the unjust incrimination of people of color.</p>\n<p>“White people are three times more likely to have drugs on them, or to be using illegal drugs … but people of color, specifically black people, are four times more likely to be searched on suspicion of having drugs,” Tajsar said. “I think the statistics speak for themselves.”</p>\n<p>During next week’s meeting, the senators will consider the Finance Board budget for the 2013-14 school year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"876185273\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51071\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51069\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/alumni-to-bring-local-flavor-to-all-gaucho-reunion/as_petervandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_PeterVandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51069\" alt=\"AS_PeterVandenbelt\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt-250x166.jpeg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>During Wednesday’s public forum, A.S.

Fees Reaffirmed</em></h2>\n<p>[[UPDATED]]</p>\n<p>Emotions were high Thursday night as Associated Students election and fee results were announced in the Hub, with the Open People’s Party sweeping every executive position and all but one senatorial seat and revealing two new initiatives — such as The Bottom Line’s lock-in fee — to have passed.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, Kyley Scarlet, Alex Moore and Alex Choate — all members of O.P.P. — will be fulfilling the roles of A.S. president, Internal Vice President, External Vice President of Local Affairs and External Vice President of Statewide Affairs, respectively. Kristian “With a K” Whittaker, an independent candidate, will be holding the office of Student Attorney General and all senators, with the exception of the uncontested seat of university owned off-campus senator, will be representatives of O.P.P. In regards to new fee initiatives, the fee for the Commission on Student Well-Being and the campus publication The Bottom Line passed.</p>\n<p>Megan Foronda, former presidential candidate of the DP party, said the lack of success that befell her party this year took a toll on party members, but will also serve as motivation for the group for years to come.</p>\n<p>“We had a lot of heart, a lot of passion, a lot of time and energy that was invested into this campaign … we saw this campaign as more than just the campaign,” Foronda said. “I may not be expressing it right now, but I think it’s fair to say that we’re all very angry, emotional and disappointed.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, O.P.P.’s success this year can be attributed primarily to the extensive planning, organizing and funding that went into preparing for this year’s campaign season.</p>\n<p>“We were very organized. Everything was planned out way in advance, so there was no confusion anytime in the election,” Abboud said. “Everyone knew exactly what they were supposed to be doing — that was biggest thing. We had amazing campaign managers who did this all for us.”</p>\n<p>Kaitlyn Christianson, this year’s EVPLA candidate from DP, said she was disappointed in the election results, not only for herself, but for the student body.</p>\n<p>“There’re a lot of good candidates on both sides. I believe in our senators and last year’s O.P.P. senators, but this year, when I would go to a campaign, to a forum, to an event, I couldn’t go without seeing DP members putting in work,” Christianson said. “I couldn’t go to any event without seeing DP members there doing hard work.”</p>\n<p>Sophia Armen, the incumbent A.S. President, said this election was a reaffirmation of her belief that the party system at UCSB is not the most productive method for representing students in a unified and effective manner.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s the best system, and that’s been seen in my policy and I’ve reflected that,” Armen said. “But I’m not the only one in Associated Students.”</p>\n<p>The recent controversy over the A.S. Senate’s decision to not divest from companies supportive of the Israeli government was a small factor in this year’s elections, according to O.P.P. Chair Sawyeh Maghsoodloo. However, Maghsoodloo said O.P.P. never took a stance on the issue of divestment, and the party never purposefully sought the support of groups for or against divesting from companies who gain from the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>“I think that divestment did play a role in the election results. It wasn’t, by any means, us initiating support from that community. It was completely voluntary, and we didn’t even organize with that group,” Maghsoodloo said. “They were all kind of on their own, rallying for O.P.P. on their own initiative.”</p>\n<p>With help from family, friends and the popular fundraising website gofundme.com, O.P.P. had a solid monetary support system to ensure the party was prepared for any obstacle, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>“All the execs asked for family contributions, and all the senators paid $150 each,” Abboud said. “We all pooled our money together, and more than half was fundraising from family and friends back home.”</p>\n<p>O.P.P. spent a total of $5,977.51 on their campaign, closely approaching the $6,000 limit imposed on parties for the election process. While the DP Party has not yet finalized their total budget, Christianson estimated the campaign costs accumulated to approximately $5,350.</p>\n<p>Annalise Domenighini, executive managing editor of <em>The Bottom Line</em>, said the students’ willingness to support the new quarterly lock-in fee of $1.69 not only affirms the importance of print media but provides an opportunity to students looking to expand their journalistic capabilities.</p>\n<p>“At <em>TBL</em>, we really like to pride ourselves on being a training organization, in addition to being a news organization. You are still allowed to join even if you don’t necessarily have any experience; we want to give it to you,” Domenighini said. “I’m really happy to see that students are still looking to print media, especially since print media is ‘dying’ and I’m very excited for the future of <em>TBL</em>.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"702901002\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51076\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51070\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/alumni-to-bring-local-flavor-to-all-gaucho-reunion/vandenbelt5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Vandenbelt5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51070\" alt=\"Vandenbelt5\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Vandenbelt5.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VENDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Newly elected A.S.
