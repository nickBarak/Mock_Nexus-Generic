In other news, the Earth is round. The Sun is hot. Did I mention water is wet? As Spring Quarter speeds to a close, even the freshmen have probably come to this conclusion by now. A newfound sense of freedom, access drugs and alcohol and anonymity all come together to create the perfect environment for casual sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unsurprisingly, sex is a hot topic of discussion in college, whether you’re talking about a latest hookup after a night out or trading your worst hookup stories at a kickback. With everyone talking about sex, it may be easy to come to the conclusion that everyone is doing it. Well, that’s not the case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ladies and gentlemen of UCSB and beyond, I am a virgin. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Abstaining for religious reasons? Waiting for marriage? Physically unable to? Emotionally unable to? The list goes on. Feel free to add some of your own assumptions to keep it interesting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although all of these are completely valid reasons not to have sex, would you believe me, if I told you that the reason why I’m still a virgin is, in fact, none of those reasons?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I’m going to be 100 percent honest with you guys because I feel like we’ve really established a sense of trust within the last two minutes. The reason why I haven’t had sex yet is because the right moment with the right guy just hasn’t presented itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my own awkward and naive fashion, I have had my fair share of defusing and escaping from sexual propositions. Now, I’m not looking for a bed of roses by candlelight experience with the absolute love of my life, but I’m also just not infatuated with the idea of a casual hookup. If I wanted to, I could find a random dude and get the deed done. However, as appealing as that sounds, I’m going to have to pass on that one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re someone who enjoys the hookup culture, then more power to you. Keep on doing what you’re doing. If you’re someone who wants more than the casual sexual encounter, well, there’s nothing wrong with wanting more. In a culture where forming an emotional attachment to your casual hookup is the greatest violation of college social norms, it may seem unthinkable to even want something meaningful.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason why I haven’t had sex yet is because the right moment with the right guy just hasn’t presented itself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">God forbid someone actually develops feelings. Even though college seems like the place where almost everyone has a list of all of the people they’ve banged and the person you like just “isn’t the relationship type,” if the idea of casually hooking up with a stranger, or a friend, or the person you like doesn’t appeal to you, you’re not alone. It doesn’t appeal to me either. It doesn’t appeal to a lot more people than you may think. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I often joke around to my friends that I may, in fact, die a virgin. And although I doubt I’ll live to the ripe old age of 72 (the average life expectancy for females in the U.S.) with my v-card still intact, this scenario is totally plausible. Tomorrow, I could be biking on my way to class, and then </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bam</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I’m hit by a car. If that happens, feel free to write “DIED A VIRGIN” on my tombstone. I won’t mind. I’ll laugh from the afterlife.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who knows, maybe I’ll end up like the 19-year-old girl who sold her virginity for $3.87 million (Just kidding, Dad!)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As my second year of college comes to a close, I’ve had quite a bit of time to reflect on my virgin status and I’ve decided that there’s really no point in stressing about it. I’ve never been in a relationship, but one day I will be. Or not. I’ve never had sex, but one day I will. Or not. Life is unpredictable like that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Hagrid once said, “What’s comin’ will come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he was talking about waiting for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to make the next move in the wizarding world, and not a college student pondering the prospect of her virginity, I’ll just keep living my life to that motto. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One ice breaker I’ve experienced was sharing our worst hookup stories, so we could all bond over the universally hilarious and cringey aspects of hookup culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once it was my turn, I had no choice but to divulge, “I’ve never hooked up with anyone, but my first kiss was nice!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Precious, I know. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who you’ve had sex with, who you are having sex with, who you aren’t having sex with—none of this defines you. Even though it can be easy to get caught up in the hookup culture, life is too short to do anything that doesn’t make you happy. College is even shorter. These four years will go by faster than you think. So, whether you’re participating in the hookup culture or not, make sure you’re doing it for you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And remember, it’s never too late to leave the “You up?” text on read.</span></p>\n<p><em>Calista Liu wants you to feel comfortable moving at your own pace.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.

What the hell happened and why did it happen?</em></p>\n<p>What you experienced, my friend, is the result of female ejaculation, otherwise known as squirting or gushing — not peeing. First and foremost, go back and apologize for leaving because she was paying you a compliment. Female ejaculation usually occurs as a result of repetitive stimulation of the “G-spot” and accompanies an orgasm that is more intense than the ordinary. The liquid that you saw, once again, was not urine. The surprising part, however, is that this liquid is secreted by all women during orgasm. Most of the time it is absorbed directly into the bladder, but for some the contractions force the liquid out causing a visible female ejaculation or “squirting.” Next time you see this happen, be grateful because you know you’re doing something right. Or maybe she thought you were into the “golden shower,” in which case … it probably was pee.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>This girl I’ve been seeing screams her brains out every time we have sex. I’m scared someone is going to think I’m hurting her and call the cops. Is there a way to bring this up or help her be less vocal?</em></p>\n<p>As everyone who lived in the dorms knows, vocal sex is not at all uncommon. Some scientists believe that moaning, or screaming, is a biological response in primate species that evolved to attract more males to mate, thereby increasing the female’s chance of fertilization. Other studies have shown that women moan as a way to express their pleasure (or pain in other situations), or even just to make their partner feel more confident. Feel free to ask what the situation is for her, it may well be uncontrollable in which case you should take that moaning as a big compliment and stop worrying about it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Every time I’ve tried shower sex it ends badly. I don’t know if it’s that I can’t find the right position or if it’s just not possible with my body. Is there a trick to it?</em></p>\n<p>Shower sex can be difficult, especially because the showers in Isla Vista are hardly big enough for one person, let alone two people trying to get weird. The fact is, it is going to be more awkward than the usual bed situation: There’s water flying in your faces, you’re bumping into one another and if you fall, you could both die. Just don’t fall and try some of these suggestions:</p>\n<p>Receiver backs into the wall and wraps leg around the giver’s hips while giver holds receiver’s leg and uses the other hand freely.</p>\n<p>Giver lies on the ground with knees bent, receiver straddles and grinds into giver.</p>\n<p>Receiver leans forward and rests hands on the wall, giver enters from behind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Why are guys so weird about kissing me after I give them head? I mean, I don’t really care after they go down on me, so what’s the deal?</em></p>\n<p>The Oracle hears about this happening all the time, and it has got to stop. Guys, that’s your body that she’s been pleasuring; she’s doing you a favor. Now do her a solid, and get over your weird fear of accidentally tasting your own semen. That’s not going to happen, and if it does, well … now you know how she feels. If you deny her a kiss after she’s worked so hard for you, she’s going to feel dirty and unwanted … and she might stop coming back. Also, while the Oracle’s at it … can we stop with the whole “pushing the girl’s head down” thing? There’s a lot a girl has to think about while she’s down there (suppressing gag reflex, keeping rhythm, stimulating testicles, remembering to breathe), and that’s not really helping.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>My girlfriend is always going to the bathroom right after we hook up … what’s she doing in there? I have this crippling fear that she’s texting all of her friends about how bad the sex was …</em></p>\n<p>Dude, first of all, chill out. Second of all … you’re going to be sorry that you ever asked. I’ll let you in on some knowledge that is commonly known to women and completely baffling to men: Girls have a lot of stuff going on down there. I know, crazy scientific, but basically, whenever you have sex, there are a lot of foreign bacteria getting in places where it just shouldn’t be. Doctors recommend that girls urinate after sex just to flush all of those bacteria out of the area, therefore helping to prevent the contraction of urinary tract infections. And trust the Oracle: if your girl has one of those, the last thing she’s going to want to do is hook up with you. Also, maybe you’ve never taken the time to ponder this, but what goes in must come out, and therefore, if you didn’t use a condom, she might be dealing with some strange dripping (another argument for condoms). Basically, it’s very unlikely that she’s in there talking about you; she’s just keeping up her hygiene, and she should be commended for it. Now you guys can have a nice, long cuddle (the Oracle insists) without her having to worry about what’s going on down there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The guy I’ve been hooking up with always wants use the same, standard position with him on top. I’m getting kind of bored down here; how can I get him to change it up?</em></p>\n<p>If you want to get what you deserve, you’ve got to start using your words. If you’re scared of hurting his feelings, don’t be; your partner isn’t going to be able to read your mind, and sometimes, in the heat of the moment, they might get greedy and forget that you have needs too. It happens to everyone, but it can easily be fixed with good old-fashioned communication. The best way that you can get your partner to try something new without killing the mood is to make it all about your partner: “I wanna be on top of you,” “I think this will feel better for you,” etc. Or, try just embracing your inner dominatrix and command of your partner what you want him to do; sometimes, the more obvious, the better. Pre-planning can also be helpful; if you’re still in the early throes of foreplay, throw them up against a wall or a chair so that your starting point isn’t the boring old bed. Hey, if you’re looking for a place to start, might I suggest you look directly to your left and check out our Position of the Week?</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>I have a ton of sexy lingerie that I bought for an ex, and I kind of want to try it out on a new manfriend. But I’m nervous … is it going to freak him out?</em></p>\n<p>The Oracle cannot tell a lie; I’ve heard about times when the lingerie has indeed freaked a partner out. Those men must be fools, but Oracle also sees how this could make for an awkward situation. If you and your partner are not very serious, they might take this move as a sign that you’re trying to take the relationship to a new level. Although, anyone out there who subscribes to this thought process should drop this idea right now; any time that your partner tries to introduce something new into the bedroom (also applies to new positions or props), they’re just trying to spice things up. Be open to new things, but if there’s something that you’re deeply uncomfortable with, you can always respectfully decline. In terms of the lingerie issue, I’d say go for it. But don’t just rip your clothes off and take your partner by surprise; it’s much more fun to give yourself a little buildup. Tell them you have something special planned, or you have a surprise. If they don’t react well, or if you get cold feet at the last minute, you can always excuse yourself for a quick bathroom change. But above all, the Oracle thinks you should do whatever you decide to do with confidence. You got this.</p>\n<p><em>Sam the Oracle is all-knowin‘ when it comes to humpin‘.

I’m going to expand your fucking horizons in every sense of the phrase. Recently, while exploring the glory that is r/sex (a “subreddit” for coital delights), I came upon something noteworthy: MojoUpgrade.com. This website is designed for couples (or comfortable fuck buddies) that allows you to explore all the little kinks that you are both interested in trying. You can imagine my enthusiasm, being the Lusty Lewis of sexual exploration that I am. As your dedicated Humptress, I surveyed the new territory and I have much to share, sweet Gauchos. This one’s for the couples.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving at MojoUpgrade, an interactive sex questionnaire for mates, I was asked whether I wanted to fill out the survey on one computer or two. I recommend doing it on two, especially after prompting my housemate and his lady-love to succumb to my experimentation. To my glee, they filled out the questionnaire in our living room. They kept peeking at each other’s answers as they filled it out and it led to much questioning of the partner and their tastes. “You want to do what to my WHAT?” was not an uncommon exclamation. If you do it on two computers, you can go through the entire questionnaire honestly and thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>As you work your way through the questionnaire, you’ll find it addresses an extensive collection of sexual proclivities. Example: I had to ponder how one might use their lover as ‘sex furniture’ (answer: as a foot stool), or what ‘felching’ is (answer: unspeakable). Intimidated? Don’t be. They also cover more basic sexual interests like hair pulling, biting, spanking, wearing heels during sex or use of toys. If you are strictly opposed to the more advanced options like domination or role-play, there is the option of excluding that set of questions in the survey. I especially enjoyed the advanced options because I always love having something new to try.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In reply to the various interests, some of the responses you can chose from are Yes/No/We Already Do that/If My Partner Is Interested. The beauty of this love machine is that if either party marks ‘No’ for any interest, the sexual niche is thrown out of the results page. That way, there is no feeling of rejection when your enthusiasm for pegging is matched with a firm no.</p>\n<p>Another guinea pig in my experiment made an interesting observation regarding the Yes/No system. If she wanted to see all the stuff he was into trying, couldn’t she just put ‘yes’ for everything? The answer to that is yes — technically. MojoUpgrade is an opportunity to open up a frank conversation between you and your partner about your interests. More than likely they will be confiding passions to you that they may be insecure about. To mark ‘yes’ to everything would be a breach of trust and defeat the purpose of the exercise.</p>\n<p>Once it’s all done, it matches the results up, showing the responses to anything not marked ‘no.’ It’s weirdly sweet seeing what your partner might be willing to concede ‘if you’re interested.’ I won’t tell you what my sexual man-friend conceded to me but it was NOT what I was expecting and I may have laughed in a most sinister and plotting manner. I’m no stranger to the phrase “I have a boner and I am a little afraid.” On top of viewing your aligning interests, each section has links to purchase items to assist in your exploration. For example, if you said you’d be interested in buying a riding crop, it would give you a link to buy aforementioned riding crop.</p>\n<p>All in all, this was a hugely rewarding experience for me and my partner. Once we had all of our results, we were both thrilled to discuss the various interests we’d marked, the rules and reservations we held regarding them and why we found particular things erotic. Your shared disclosure generates a lot of intimacy and sex will be more rewarding for the both of you, in that you can cater to their interests better.</p>\n<p>So my little ducklings, remember: Whether or not you’re a couple, be sure to tell your partner what gets your loins a-frothing. Sex should be a freeing expression and a chance to learn new things about yourself. If you feel like you’re holding yourself back, you’re doing it wrong.

However, men seem to harbor no shame about the fact that, yeah, they masturbate. So why do women still tend to feel discouraged to explore their lady parts? Why does it feel so taboo to learn your own body?</p>\n<p>I can say that I subscribed to this dichotomy between the sexes for so long because I was embarrassed and afraid that it was “wrong” to touch myself or to use toys to help get me going (if you know what I mean). It isn’t necessarily the most common thing for women to do, nor does it tend to be discussed in the same way that men so openly talk about it, but undeniably, there is a large number of women who masturbate regularly.</p>\n<p>I was thinking to myself, “If I don’t know what I like, how will I be able to tell future lovers how to properly please me?” Most women have no idea what an orgasm feels like, and I didn’t want to be one of the many who have never received such pleasure. So, of course, like the human that I am, I asked Google what would be the best way to achieve proper climax, because obviously Google has the answers to everything, ever. This was when I learned that, although a man can help, you must first learn how to be comfortable with your own body, which entails self-exploration. One way that they suggest you can start exploring is by considering the idea of investing in sex toys. Yes girls, I said it — sex toys.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Going off of Google’s recommendation, I began researching different kinds of sex toys. And if you didn’t know — because I had no idea — there is an extremely wide variety of vibrators and I came (*wink wink*) upon a world of possibility, a world that I never knew existed. It was like my own personal <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> experience and boy, was I excited!</p>\n<p>There were beginner vibrators, which were very traditional, simply vibrating as you place them onto your clitoris, until at last they reach an intensity to make you climax like you’ve never felt before. Or there are more advanced sex toys, like the Luna Beads which are a pair of ball-shaped objects that you insert and then go about your daily business. For those of you who have read<em> 50 Shades of Grey</em>, I’m sure you know full well what these lovely beads are. They create this lovely tugging sensation that seems to pull from a dark place of pleasure, without even having to use it on your clitoris or do any work yourself. It’s as though your libido is on fire with burning pleasure and completely relaxed at the same time. All you need to do is a little bit of walking, and there is nothing wrong with a little bit of walking, I mean a little exercise never hurt anybody. If you’re having a bad day, what better way to brighten it than to use your new Luna Beads and clean the house? I can tell you now that cleaning will never be the same again.</p>\n<p>After experimenting with these two toys is when I first discovered that orgasms truly were as great as those screaming girls in porn make it seem and that I never wanted to experience another sexual encounter without an orgasm again. So yes, women have as much of a right to orgasm as men do! And if you ever have to question whether or not you’ve orgasmed, there’s a good chance that you haven’t because you will know when it happens. That’s when you will realize the magic you have been missing out on.</p>\n<p>This first experience is especially important in college because some men are still learning what they’re doing, and the best thing you can do for yourself and your partner is to teach him or her what you like. And the only way to teach is to know what you like, right?</p>\n<p>Change your sex life. Use toys! Explore yourself and reach climaxes like you’ve never felt. It can’t hurt to find your sexual preferences and realize how much more fun you could have been having all along. If nothing else, you can feel like you’ve done women everywhere a service in teaching someone else the proper way to please a woman. That’s the worst that can happen. At best, you get your mind blown several times over. Sex is great, but so much better when you know what you’re doing.</p>\n<p>I don’t recommend advertising your love for sex toys to everyone you meet — it may scare some people away and then you’ll be stuck with your toys for the night. As fun as they are, they’re no substitute for the real thing. They’re pretty lonely. But you’ll know when and where to bring it up. Find a consistent buddy who can help you climax with or without your toys because, although masturbation is a beautiful thing, sometimes it’s fun and sexy when you’re using your pleasure toys with another person.</p>\n<p>The moral of the story, ladies? Invest. Learn yourself, learn what you like. What can you lose from a little one-on-one time? I can say now: Best Investment Ever.</p>\n<p><em>Wendy Doer knows what she’s doing tonight.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, January 22, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
