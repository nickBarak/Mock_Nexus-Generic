The beautiful flowers that bloom on the trees are a very powerful symbol in Japanese culture, and the gift was meant to establish a lasting peace and friendship between the two countries. Fast forward to 2017 and the trees have grown and evolved in the new context of a bustling New York City, and Sakura Park stands as a living, breathing example of cultural unity. Despite some fluctuation in international relations, Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig has intricately crafted his weird, quirky and creatively flawed internet-era version of Sakura Park. His new anime Netflix Original starring Jaden Smith is “Neo Yokio,” an imperfect yet extremely dynamic model of the exaggerated tropes of both New York and Japanese cultures. The work is a living culture shock, and although not worthy of high regard or reward, it is more than anything commendable for its creative liberties and merely the fact that it even exists in the first place.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Neo Yokio,” or the Japanese form of “New York,” blends anime, uptown socialites and hip-hop culture into a single unique, and often overwhelming, force. These three seemingly random movements, however, have been blending together for quite some time now. Recently, we have been seeing SoundCloud rappers with anime-ridden profiles, and the clothing brand A Bathing Ape is more prevalent than ever in the states. Rapper Lil Uzi Vert (who happens to look like an anime character himself) posts about “Cowboy Bebop” on his Instagram, and of course, the cult-classic anime-meets-black-television show, “The Boondocks,” remains a legendary piece of small screen history. But “Neo Yokio” seems to directly blend cultures more than ever before, so much so that it has become the main attraction of the show.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Neo Yokio” follows the extremely wealthy socialite and coveted bachelor Kaz Kaan, who is voiced by Jaden Smith. Kaz frequently wears high fashion brands such as Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton and Gucci, he is the star of his preppy field hockey team, he attends high-class parties and balls and he gets flown around town by his robot butler. His Aunt Agatha, voiced by Susan Sarandon, looks out for him and arranges appointments for his other important hobby, exorcizing demons. This leads to the first main issue with “Neo Yokio”; it has way too much going on. The work often struggles to navigate back and forth between socialite life, young city life and the wild card of demon exorcism. However, this excess does not prevent the show from maintaining excitement, commentary, occasional humor and unique style.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Outside of the saturated and scattered plot, “Neo Yokio” finds more value visually and stylistically more than anything else. The show looks beautiful on screen, and the creative character design works well in front of quality voice acting, specifically from Jaden Smith. Much like the enigmatic young prodigy, the show constantly finds redeeming moments of weird yet profound intelligence and artistry. Quotes like, “Who cares what time it is when the future is an interminable abyss of wackiness?” and “Demon be gone from this Chanel suit!” are examples of the kind of perplexing weirdness that, whether you like or not, can be appreciated.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79105\" style=\"width: 825px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1921343512\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79105\" data-attachment-id=\"79105\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/unnamed-45/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=815%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"815,508\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=815%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79105\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=815%2C508\" alt=\"\" width=\"815\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?w=815&amp;ssl=1 815w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=768%2C479&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Behind all the nonsense and randomness of this fascinating creation, there is a deeper commentary on materiality, elitism, capitalism and fandom. Throughout the colorful landscapes of Neo Yokio, Kaz is frequently seen worrying about comically insignificant things, including wearing a midnight blue suit to a black and white ball, the rundown status of his childhood home in the Hamptons and his constant belittling for being “neo-riche.” He also constantly refers to his ex-girlfriend, Cathy, who he can’t seem to get over. In this sense, Kaz functions as a modern-day animated Hamlet, coming from extreme wealth and constantly distraught and complaining about love and the world around him. This character functions well in the New York context, a clear critique of the materialistic and elitist culture that upscale cities maintain. A more direct critique of this is Neo Yokio’s list of most eligible bachelors, which appears to be a nod to “One Punch Man”’s hero rankings. In Neo Yokio, young male bachelors are ranked in a fluctuating list posted in the middle of the city. Kaz is seen going up and down on this list throughout the show, greatly influencing his perception in the public eye as well as his general happiness. This is not only a fascinating dialogue about the elite social classes in modern society, but also an interesting response to the mixed reviews that the show has been receiving. Elements like these are some of the quirks that make “Neo Yokio” a success in its details, rather than the big picture.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As far as traditional anime is concerned, “Neo Yokio” is nothing revolutionary or even memorable on a narrative level. “Neo Yokio” is more than just weird, as it also often can be choppy, strange and lacking fluidity in storytelling. This show may often bring the audience to laugh when they’re not supposed to, be taken aback by the dialogue and question what even just happened on-screen. Despite these things, “Neo Yokio” demands a watch and, more importantly, a discussion because of its unique ability to blend cultures, create profound creative moments, provoke thought and make memories. Whether or not it resonates with you or at times even succeeds to make sense, “Neo Yokio” guarantees an experience that is memorable and by all means entertaining.</p>\n<p>This is a show that, despite mixed critical reception and even accusations of appropriation, should be appreciated and enjoyed for its role in blending cultures. Even more so, we should celebrate the fact that Ezra Koenig made an anime with Jaden Smith about a demon-exorcising socialite in New York and was able to have Netflix fund it. We should celebrate the fact that we live in a time where strange art like this can be created and distributed at such a high rate. We should also celebrate the fact that, in an ever-divisive world, strange art like this has an audience. Perhaps it has less historical significance and general impact on the world than the real Sakura Park, but the ridiculous and outrageous “Neo Yokio” is still worthy of our attention and should be celebrated for its cultural push.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/","id":5788,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[5787,5786,5785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales","biography":"Not available","articles":[5770,5788,6540,6607,6625,6638,6648,6652,6659,6688,6699,6702,6707,6744,6760,6765,6807],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Netflix’s Newest Fantasy Series ‘Castlevania’ Has Bite, But Only a Nibble","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-07-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=980%2C578&ssl=1","description":"Netflix's \"Castlevania\" series has the distinction of being the very first video game adaptation to be just okay.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix’s “Castlevania”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series has the distinction of being the very first video game adaptation to be just okay.

But, alas, despite the combined talent, including the likes of established fantasy/sci-fi actors Richard Armitage and James Callis, the show only just manages to distinguish itself from prior crappy video game adaptations by not totally sucking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plot, for those of you who didn’t grow up blowing on the insides of your game cartridges, involves Dracula (Graham McTavish) vowing vengeance on the people of Wallachia after his wife Lisa (Emily Swallow) is burned at the stake. One year later, his giant bat-thing minions are romping around, eating babies, killing peasants and just generally having a grand ol’ time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter Trevor Belmont (Armitage), the whip-wielding vampire hunter with amusingly triangular beard hair and a laughably neat scar over his left eye that often looks purple in the right lighting. Besides being a disappointingly standard reluctant hero, Belmont also serves as the primary exposition machine, almost constantly spouting information about his family in order to explain his character motivations. Because screw nuance and mystery, let’s just tell everyone outright who the hell this guy is and why he’s doing stuff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s not even an interesting enough story here to utilize Belmont to any interesting degree. In fact, it’s just as standard and cookie-cutter as he is: a hero who doesn’t care about anyone ends up in town. He meets people. He gives a shit. He defends the town. End. Yay! Although perhaps the show can be given credit to adhering more to Western clichés than fantasy ones.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78589\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1267486673\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78588\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78589\" data-attachment-id=\"78589\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=1308%2C578&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1308,578\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=250%2C110&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?fit=888%2C393&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78589 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1-1024x453.png?resize=888%2C393\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=1024%2C453&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=250%2C110&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?resize=768%2C339&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/castlevania-netflix-trailer-image-1.png?w=1308&amp;ssl=1 1308w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78589\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What could have potentially remedied this uninspired tale was if any of the secondary characters were able to compensate for Belmont’s dull characterization. Alas, no. Belmont does not interact with very many people and when he does, it’s often just to provide more exposition. His exchange with a villainous bishop (Matt Frewer, who seems to be taking a lot of influence from Tony Jay’s performance in “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”) wrangles little tension, the paramount moment of said conversation amounting the bishop to basically just telling Belmont, “Go away.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the best part of the show is its ending, and no, not because it’s over. Belmont and the mage Sypha (Alejandra Reynoso) come across a fan-favorite character and fight him in the season’s final boss battle (after only four episodes, unfortunately). The fight between Belmont and said character is enjoyably frenetic, demonstrating their superhuman abilities to their full degrees and revealing the nature of their characters. It’s a much more satisfying conclusion than a prior battle that the entire season was building up to, which comes and goes with an “eh.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Story aside, what may have been the second-biggest draw for some people was the show being animated. Oftentimes, animation can be the superior medium to deliver a fantasy story, as it forgoes having to build extravagant sets and blow a fortune on CGI. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here though, the animation is about on par with your average modern anime. People and creatures are all drawn, whereas the backgrounds are all obviously computer generated. But with the characters being consistently on-model and some killer lighting (evoking fellow vampire series “Hellsing Ultimate” at points), it gets the job done, even if every so often, there are a couple small mishaps involving mechanical lips and wonky arms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering it’s tantalizingly short length, “Castlevania” is better off being binged as a film, maybe on a boring summer day, because this is not Netflix’s big new hit by any means. It’s fun at times, but it does not exceed in any particular area to be considered anything other than a light snack. The series itself is also, I think, too old for our age group to cull any personal investment in seeing the famous game series be adapted to television.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Wehrung likes the movie “Super Marios Bros.,” so take his opinion with a grain of salt. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78588\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78588\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-07-19/netflixs-newest-fantasy-series-castlevania-has-bite-but-only-a-nibble/","id":5785,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5784,5783,5782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Wonder Woman’ Carries the DC Universe Forward","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017_The_Wonder_Woman_Gal_Gadot_wide.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017_The_Wonder_Woman_Gal_Gadot_wide.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Seeing the Wonder Woman character kick ass as her incredible theme song builds up around her is more than worth the ticket price, and anyone who isn’t giddy for at least a minute as she charges towa...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“Wonder Woman” has finally arrived with the weight of DC’s future resting upon her shoulders. But has director Patty Jenkins been able to finally break the chain of critical flops, from that of “Batman v Superman” to that of “Suicide Squad?” Have our beloved childhood comic-book heroes finally been released from the poisonous grip of Zack Snyder? Well, it’s a bit difficult to say. For the most part the answer is yes; “Wonder Woman” is far from being a letdown. The film, which is at times incredible and at other times questionable, is more of a successful bunt than it is a home-run, with the folks at DC taking a very cautious and careful step forward toward critical redemption. The result is a well-executed yet formulaic film that abides by the many tired conventions of the comic book form, leaving little room for innovation and frustrating anyone looking for a fresh new take on the comic book genre. Still, for anyone looking for a fun, fast-paced action-adventure blockbuster, then this is exactly what you’ve been looking for. But for those of us who wish for something more from their comic-book films, you’ll be left wanting just a little bit more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1645836084\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78366\"><img data-attachment-id=\"78367\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=936%2C334&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"936,334\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"song\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=250%2C89&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?fit=888%2C317&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-78367\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=888%2C317\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=250%2C89&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/song.jpg?resize=768%2C274&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>The good news is that there are plenty of aspects to enjoy about the film. Each and every location and act, save the final CGI airfield mess, is incredibly entertaining, at least on a surface level. From the beautiful Amazonian home of Themyscira, which showcases some of the film’s more outlandish and entertaining sequences (when will you ever again get to watch Amazon warriors face off against villainous Germans?) to the solemn war-torn fields of the Eastern Front, the film has its fair share of exotic locales and engrossing scenarios.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The issue here is the film’s jittery pace, as it never wants to stand still and take a breather. Halfway through the movie you’ll feel like you’ve tasted 20 different flavors of drastically different films, but you’re never allowed to stay and watch any one of them long enough to be satisfied. Between action sequences that mirror the adventures of Indiana Jones and the London alleyways that echo political spy thrillers, the film can never seem to decide on which movie it wants to be. And that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because each small snippet of genre, from fantasy to war, is relatively well-done. But having less than five minutes of screen time designated to the trenches of World War I can leave some with an unquenched thirst. Regardless, between its various moments of exhilaration, the film does a more than satisfactory job of keeping your attention focused, even if it all just feels like it’s skimming the surface of something that could have been even more worthwhile.</p>\n<p>The best scenes of the film are those that take the time to slow down, and these scenes are mostly shared between Gal Gadot (Diana aka Wonder Woman) and Chris Pine (Steve Trevor) as they confront the moral complexities of war. The contrasting of Trevor’s first-hand understanding of the horrors of war with Diana’s naïve black-and-white morality brings out the much deeper themes that the film desperately needs. Pine’s monologues on the nature of war are especially moving. One of the best sequences I’ve ever seen in a comic-book film has the two leads dancing in a war-torn village as snow begins to fall. Diana asks Trevor what people do when there isn’t any war to fight. He responds that they eat breakfast, read the paper, get married and do other mundane things typical of a peaceful time. When she asks him what it’s like to do such things, he wearily responds, “I have no idea.” The war runs deep in these scenes and shapes our leads into better characters. It’s a shame that the film barely addresses these issues, as these dramatic and heart-breaking moments bring out the best in Gadot’s performance and showcases the best the film has to offer. Moments like these are lovingly crafted by Jenkins.</p>\n<p>With a rather large and diverse cast, “Wonder Woman” establishes many great characters, although they’re accompanied by a few unfortunate duds. The standout here is clearly Pine’s character of Steve Trevor. Pine is funny, charming, courageous and downright inspirational (and as my girlfriend pointed out, downright cute). I wouldn’t be surprised if Pine used this performance as his audition tape for the next Indiana Jones. The subtleness in his acting, alongside his ability to make even the most ridiculous of scenes seem plausible, allows Pine to ultimately steal the spotlight. While his role in the film is structurally set up to support the overall progression of Gadot’s character and narrative, the film is arguably just as much Trevor’s story as it is Wonder Woman’s, which may be a problem for some.</p>\n<p>Gadot’s Wonder Woman is the hardest character to evaluate. While she performs feats of incredible strength and frequently takes control of her own decisions, charging into battle to save the lives of those in need, the character is equally as often presented as a naïve and almost “ditsy” character. While this “fish-out-of-water” personality fits within the narrative and is quite charming to watch, it makes it hard to distinguish Gadot’s acting ability from the youthful naivety of her character. Paired with her accent, some lines come out as just sounding off.</p>\n<p>But for the most part, Gadot can hold more than her own. She’s brave, sweet and can even pull out a surprising dramatic flair in some of her more emotional scenes. Seeing the Wonder Woman character kick ass as her incredible theme song builds up around her is more than worth the ticket price, and anyone who isn’t giddy for at least a minute as she charges toward the trenches of war has lost a part of their childhood <em>wonder</em>. It goes without saying that Gadot is a new inspirational action hero, not just for a female audience but for the general public as well.</p>\n<p>The supporting cast varies in talent. Robin Wright, who plays Wonder Woman’s mentor, Antiope, is absolutely amazing. Her stern kindness and sly grin, flashing in the face of battle, make the short time spent with her character immensely enjoyable. David Thewlis is also as calming and talented as ever, even though his character sputters out in the last act. Eugene Brave Rock as the Chief, however, is shockingly terrible. There haven’t been too many performances that I have audibly laughed at before, and I can only suggest that aspiring actors use his performance as a case study for how not to act in a film. The villains, Danny</p>\n<p>Huston’s Ludendorff and Elena Anaya’s Dr. Maru, are disappointingly misused in the film. Ludendorff, while convincingly acted, is just another addition to the throwaway comic-book movie villain fodder, and together with Dr. Maru, the two act more like the laughable villains of a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon. It’s a shame, too, because Anaya’s Dr. Maru is absolutely chilling in her few brief appearances and could have made a memorable female supervillain if she hadn’t been ultimately cast aside for an unnecessary CGI slugfest.</p>\n<p>“Wonder Woman” is far from a bad film. There are barely any major issues outside of a forced third act and an annoying absence of development and quiet time for our characters. But an absence of glaring issues does not mean that the film is great, or even very good. The film at its best is a fun popcorn flick. Beyond its period setting, “Wonder Woman” isn’t very different from your run-of-the-mill comic book fare. The grouping up of our heroes to face off against an undeveloped super-baddie is just so overdone at this point that the outcome is exhausting. There’s nothing here that you haven’t seen before.</p>\n<p>In a sense, “Wonder Woman” has saved the DCEU for Warner Brothers, <em>with</em> its glowing praise and an enormous opening. But at what cost? The company’s answer to the scathing reviews and steep revenue drop-offs of its former DC films is in the form of a relatively safe and formulaic picture. While the film may surpass the quality of its predecessors and even overcome a few of the Marvel features, it nevertheless cripples itself to the expectations set by the typical comic book venture, forcing “Wonder Woman” to shy away from its more engrossing and deeper themes. Nearly a decade after Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight,” critics and audiences seem to have greatly lowered their expectations for what a comic book film could be. Even though “Wonder Woman” is far from being a bad film, passing up plenty of its comic contemporaries, we shouldn’t have to lower our standards for our childhood superheroes due to the genre’s often mediocre result. While “Wonder Woman” isn’t mediocre, it still isn’t great and holds on as tight as it possibly can to the prospect of being good. Still, the film is a step in the right direction, albeit a very cautious one.</p>\n<p>Despite all of this, “Wonder Woman” is still incredibly enjoyable to watch and is probably the best movie out right now. You can’t help but smile when her incredibly energetic theme song fills the theater.</p>\n<p>Yet, the most cynical of us will always wonder to ourselves what could have been.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78366\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78366\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/wonder-woman-carries-the-dc-universe-forward/","id":5786,"author":{"id":772,"name":"Christian Watts"},"related":[5785,5784,5783],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Time For a Change","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Margaux Gundzik explains why we need to find a solution to our violent culture.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This is all too familiar. The shock. The sorrow. The endless newspaper headlines. The outrage. The undeserved fame of the perpetrator. The posts on social media that use this heartbreak to fight for — or against — something.  The memorials. The faces of lives cut short unjustly immortalized on our television sets, at least, that is, until they become interchangeable with the faces of the victims of our nation’s next great tragedy. Despite their grim implications, these elements are not foreign to me. Since 1993, the year I was born, 127 fatal school shootings have occurred in the United States. I am no stranger to violence at this point.</p>\n<p>But this time, it’s completely different. I heard those gunshots as they were fired behind my house and the cries of pain that followed close behind. This is my shock, my sorrow. My home being infiltrated by unapologetic news trucks and over-eager reporters. My community being scrutinized daily in the pages of every national newspaper. My heartbreak being sensationalized on TV screens around the world to the point that I cannot walk into a room with the television on without feeling physically sick. My outrage. The fame and glorification of the demented individual responsible for the physical and psychological damage of my entire school, of my entire town. People fighting via social media over the politics and morality of my own traumatizing experience. My memorial in my school’s stadium. My friends weeping beside me as the victims’ families speak of the children they’ve lost. The faces of the people whose last screams will haunt me indefinitely, displayed on every television set and every website. Faces of my classmates, of members of my community, of people my friends knew and loved, of people who could have just as easily been me. It all seems so familiar, until it happens to you, and you realize that it’s completely different.</p>\n<p>This is not normal. 137 fatal school shootings in the past 34 years is not normal. For parents to outlive their children is not normal. There is a problem here and quite frankly, I am more than frustrated, more than pained. I am downright insulted. Why does no one seem to care? Why is this still going on? Why are our leaders so concerned about fighting wars in countries on the other side of the world while they have yet to address that there is a war going on inside our very borders amongst our own people?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Civilian gun violence needs to be addressed on a much more serious level. We can no longer ignore the fact that U.S. citizens’ legal access to killing machines has caused us to become the country responsible for the most murders of its own citizens.</p>\n<p>I am not going to list off political points defending this because I do not believe that there is any logical, humane argument that exists that can discredit this statement. My only point I wish to make is that I have witnessed on a very personal level just one instance of the effects of our nation’s loose gun control policies. Just one instance — one shooter — that has destroyed the lives of tens of thousands of people. One of 137.</p>\n<p>I am deeply saddened, but I am also absolutely enraged.  How many instances is it going to take? How many more personal accounts like this one are going to have to be heard? How many more tens of thousands of lives are going to have to be destroyed? How many more people will have to die for something to change?<br>\nI wouldn’t wish this kind of trauma on even my worst enemies, and I genuinely hope that not one more person has to experience what my community, and all other 137 communities that have been shaken by similar tragedies, have gone through.</p>\n<p>In honor of Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, Veronika Weiss, Katherine Cooper, James Hong, George Chen and David Wang, I ask you to reconsider the world of fear and violence we currently inhabit, where my tragedy is just another familiar story, versus the world we want to inhabit — the world we want our children and grandchildren to inhabit. We are responsible for creating this world.</p>\n<p>Not one more life stolen, not one more memorial, not one more student, classmate, friend, sibling, boyfriend, girlfriend or child. This is my country, my home, and I refuse to feel unsafe here any longer.<br>\n<em>Margaux Gundzik is a second-year communications major.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55685\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-29/time-for-a-change-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55685\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-29/time-for-a-change-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-29/time-for-a-change-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-29/time-for-a-change-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-29/time-for-a-change-2/","id":5787,"author":{"id":423,"name":"Margaux Gundzik"},"related":[5786,5785,5784],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
