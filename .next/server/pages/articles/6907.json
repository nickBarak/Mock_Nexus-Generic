Memorial Sports Arena &amp; Exposition Park for the second time with the most eclectic selection of alternative musical talent. Here are the highlights everyone is talking about.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Kanye West:</strong></div>\n<div>While controversy resulting from Kanye’s gaffes and self-comparisons to political and religious leaders seem to appear at E! News daily, the controversy of West’s replacement of <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1995849670\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Saturday</span></span> headliner Frank Ocean was (just this once) not his fault. If Kanye decided to proclaim his greatness for 30 minutes, the gargantuan upset resulting from Ocean’s removal from the lineup may have landed FYF with irreparably damaged reputation. It didn’t.</div>\n<div>The set began with West’s remix of Frank Ocean’s “No Church in the Wild,” in homage to the absent R&amp;B idol. Kanye performed with a certain self-awareness about his position and sensitivity for Ocean fans that Yeezus non-believers would have no reason to believe he was previously capable.</div>\n<div>He had both G.O.O.D. Music protégé Travi$ Scott and pop icon Rihanna make special guest appearances. He didn’t speak, except a few acknowledgments of the crowd and banter with his stage crew.</div>\n<div>When the keyboard line from “Runaway” blared over the speakers, crowd members moaned audibly in fear that West would continue the song for half an hour of the set as he has done in the past.  After a mere 10 minutes, Kanye West said, “I could sing this song for another 40 minutes, but I only got 10 minutes left and 10 years of music left. I got to play my motherf*cking hits.” He proceeded to perform nearly a hit a minute before the stage went dark and the crowd erupted into applause.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>The Jesus and Mary Chain:</strong></div>\n<div>This Scottish alternative post-punk/noise-pop group has had a rocky history. They formed originally in 1983, broke up in 1999 and re-formed in 2007. Lead vocalist Jim Reid wore a simple black and white striped t-shirt under his dark brown 80’s era leather jacket. Despite being well into his fifties, Reid sang with the same spacy and smooth timbre of his 25-year-old self. Reid’s subtle hip perks and slow sidesteps carried a stark Frankie Valli semblance.</div>\n<div>During hits like “Something’s Wrong,” the blue stage lights silhouetted the dust kicked up from the ground, adding to the trance-inducing effect to the labyrinthine guitar rhythms. JMC is one of those bands whose place in rock music carries such clout that there were certainly concert attendees present who purchased FYF wristbands just to see them. A celebrity-sized ego never developed alongside their fame, which became apparent when a soft-voiced Reid thanked the audience after just about every other song.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>D’Angelo and the Vanguard:</strong></div>\n<div>Following its December 2014 release, Black Messiah’s explosive reception has made 2015 the year of D’Angelo. Black Messiah is D’Angelo’s first studio release since 2000, and the subsequent tour is his first since 2012. While the neo-soul singer has been reticent about the reasons for his hiatus, the precision and energy present in the performance prove that he was diligent in his musical endeavors during his disappearance.</div>\n<div>At large music festivals, an astounding majority of concerts feature audience members that are either completely or partially static during any given musical performance. The Vanguard’s performance wasn’t that. Rarely stopping to rest, concert-goers could be seen grinning and side-stepping up to 100 yards back from the stage.</div>\n<div>Technically speaking, the show played like jazz. In terms of feeling, this was funk. The abundance of marbled guitar licks, gospel-inspired harmonies and punctuating horn lines made it easy to imagine the band cramping on a sofa re-watching old James Brown performances.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Death Grips:</strong></div>\n<div>Despite playing the smallest stage, this post-industrial electro-thrash hop group drew one of the largest crowds of any show this weekend. They also drew the largest crowd at that stage all weekend. The entire field that comprised The Trees stage was densely packed with sweaty rage-fueled youth.</div>\n<div>Death Grips disbanded abruptly in July 2014, re-formed in October of the same year and then a released an album soon after. Needless to say, fans have been on a very temperamental rollercoaster ride. FYF was the chance for Death Grips listeners to release their suppressed anger.</div>\n<div>Vocalist MC Ride manically screeched out the words from at least a song from every single album in the Death Grips discography. If you watched the crowd, you wouldn’t think that the fans were even listening. The entire audience formed an ever-shifting, punching, sweaty and dense mass of bodies. Death Grips music isn’t for the weak-hearted, but their almost-cultish control over their following is an undeniable testament of their dark and impressive vision.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Savages:</strong></div>\n<div>When conservative suburban parents have nightmares about their kids falling into the punk-rock scene, their worries are usually misplaced. Most punk bands and clubs are as normal as you and me. Savages are the exception. This all-female, London-based post-punk group is scarier than your first viewing of A Nightmare on Elm Street.</div>\n<div>Their uniform was black leather, black eyeliner and black nails. Their backlights were a ghostly white. Their guitar sounds like the screech of a knife on a window. At FYF, lead singer Jehnny Beth became the reason why the connection between the occult and rock music didn’t die along with Black Sabbath.</div>\n<div>Beth sang Savages mainstay songs like, “Evil” and “Hit Me” in a hypnotic dirge and then broke into sharp snarls without a moment’s notice. During the closing of “Husbands,” Beth shrieked, “If you all stop dancing, we stop playing.” She prepared to step off stage, as fans extended their hands. With her microphone in hand, she walked on top of the palms of front-row fans. “My room, my life, my husbands,” she screamed as she made a coffin on top of the crowd.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div id=\"attachment_64577\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64577\" data-attachment-id=\"64577\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/fyf-fest-2015-highlights/fyf-savages-640x472-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?fit=640%2C472&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,472\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"fyf-savages-640×472-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?fit=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?fit=640%2C472&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64577\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?resize=600%2C443\" alt=\"Courtesy of stereogum.com\" width=\"600\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fyf-savages-640x472-2.jpg?resize=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-64577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>stereogum.com</em></p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Noise Pop and Another Planet Entertainment truly designed this festival with the attendee in mind. Shuttles that run all day made travel to and from the island a breeze. Two stages situated right across from each other made maneuvering between acts quick and painless. Non-conflicting set times meant that festival-goers could show up just 10 minutes before their favorite artist’s set time and still get front row.</p>\n<p>Oh, and forget dodging elbows to the face and feeling packed like a sardine. The TIMF crowd actually respects personal space and the “first come, first served” rule. Of course, the occasional muscle-teed and snapback-capped gent may have tried to muscle through the crowd. However, TIMF’s infrequency of the aforementioned demographic makes this festival a walk in the park compared to the usual death match Coachella crowds can devolve into.</p>\n<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a San Francisco music festival without some good eats. In fact, Bay Area local Robyn Green said that her family’s goal was to “eat at every food stand here.” That is a noble goal indeed, Mrs. Green. The tea party included paella, chocolate-covered bacon, coca-cola braised pork sandwiches and acai bowls. Perhaps the best way to enjoy this delicious food was at the comedy tent where one could see Lauren Lapkus (“Orange Is the New Black” and “Jurassic World”) performing improv or Jerrod Carmichael (“Neighbors”) doing some standup. Silent Frisco’s Silent Disco party served as the best calorie burner, where hoards of people simultaneously performed interpretive dance. But now, on to the music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Dressed in Hawaiian shirts and shorts, Viceroy kicked off the festival with a beach party. With the support of electric fiddles, saxophones and bongos, Viceroy remixed quite a few Top 40 tracks. The crowd responded positively.</p>\n<p>Later on, Run the Jewels graced the Bridge stage with an electrifying performance. They ran out to a rendition of Queen’s “We Are the Champions,” and Killer Mike instantly let the crowd know of his intention to “burn the stage to the fucking ground.” And so they did by spewing vocal fire all over the Bridge. As if RtJ needed to win the crowd over even more, the duo sealed the deal when they took a moment to thank Steph Curry for using one of their songs in a commercial and paid their respects to the late, great Mac Dre.</p>\n<p>Cashmere Cat’s soothing sunset performance was the perfect antidote to the RtJ-induced energy. The Norwegian DJ delivered a performance with a perfect balance of dreamlike melodies and euphoric, dancy vibes that set the tone for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most anticipated performance of the weekend was the debut of Big Grams. This surprising pair, consisting of Outkast’s Big Boi and electronic duo Phantogram, was definitely a treasure at Treasure Island, or as Big Boi put it, “We come together like butt cheeks.” Big Boi even gave the crowd a treat by going back to his roots and offering up a sing-along of Outkast’s “Ms. Jackson.”</p>\n<p>At this point in the night, temperatures fell quite low and the biting breeze of the bay began to leave its sting. It was appropriate then that deadmau5 was fashionably late. Twenty minutes later, just the lighting of The Dome was enough to send the audience in a frenzy, and long interludes into favorites like “Ghosts N Stuff” and “The Veldt” sustained them. Pulsing beats combined with hypnotizing visuals transported the crowd into the brilliant mind of Joel Zimmerman for 90 minutes. Deadmau5’s set was much more than a performance; it was an experience.</p>\n<p>Coming off the high that was day one, day two fell a bit flat.</p>\n<p>If day one was a dancer’s paradise, day two was a lazy Sunday afternoon in a coffee shop which, for the most part, fit the lineup. An appearance from Karl the Fog definitely added to the mood as well. As Jose Gonzalez gracefully strummed away on his guitar, attendees meditated, practiced yoga and had picnics on the lawn.</p>\n<p>Father John Misty did what most performers of the day failed to do: offer a heartfelt performance. In between poking fun at the videographers and joking about the necessity of a man bun due to the high winds, Father John Misty belted out songs so beautifully, you had to hold your “honeybear” … or wish you had one.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Deerhunter failed to elicit any emotion from the audience. Lead singer Bradford Cox even commented that “it sounds like a library out there.” However, this comment seemed like more of a dig at his own band since it takes a lot to shut a Bay Area crowd up.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Chvrches picked the pace right back up and unleashed the crowd’s full potential. Even though lead singer Lauren Mayberry apologized for the wind messing with her vocals and giving her “hairballs,” she did not miss a single note. The synth-pop trio’s charm drew one of the biggest crowds of the weekend.</p>\n<p>The National closed out this wonderful festival in style by bringing out Chvrches’ own Mayberry. She joined in on a duet of “I Need My Girl” with Matt Berninger in a live performance even better than the original. Proving that they get better with age, The National delivered a delightful performance and defended their legitimacy as a festival headliner.</p>\n<p>This festival had it all: diversity, spontaneity, you name it. With a little luck, one may even spot a few Jack Sparrows running around. And maybe, just maybe, if you wear a shark costume, deadmau5 will pull you up on stage. Anything is possible at Treasure Island.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65654\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65654\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/","id":6904,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[6903,6902,6901],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hozier Performs Highly Anticipated Set at SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hozier-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hozier-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Literally.

Not trying to sound like a character from “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” but Hozier left his fans looking for more. The Irish singer-songwriter’s visit to Santa Barbara on his debut solo tour was filled with hopes and promises of a potentially incredible night. However, the concert fell short in duration because the set time was only one hour and 20 minutes long. The show felt like a music festival set, due to his single LP discography. Nonetheless, Hozier’s soulful voice still mesmerized the audience through his personally written and produced songs.</p>\n<p>At approximately 8:10 p.m., the stage lights dimmed to indigo colors and the seating area slowly faded to black. Hozier walked up to the microphone while carrying his electric guitar. The opening song, “Like Real People Do,” spoke of endless possibilities of a new romantic relationship while retaining the memories of past experiences. Some of the standout songs from the set list include, “Angel of Small Death and the Codeine Scene,” “Someone New,” “It Will Come Back” and “Arsonist’s Lullabye.” As the show continued, Hozier’s next song, “In A Week” had a special guest duet from none other than his right-hand cellist on tour, Alana Henderson. Together, they sang a beautiful love song that resonated across the stage to the lovers who were in the audience.</p>\n<p>In an exclusive interview with <em>Daily Nexus</em> before the concert, Irish folk singer Henderson sat down and talked about supporting the “Take Me to Church” phenomenon on tour. The 27-year-old was offered a chance to perform with the then up-and-comer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

But after all, fans were awaiting a religious experience, and six-foot-five talent was there to bless the crowd. That true religious experience came when the crooner blessed the crowd with the opening lines, “My lover’s got humor/She’s the giggle at a funeral.”]] People chanted and yelled the hit song as if it was their mission to be heard. Many thought the singer would end the night with the chosen song, but Hozier was quick to prove them wrong.</p>\n<p>After thanking everyone on his tour, from the band to the light support, the Irish native walked off stage. Fans were sad to see him leave, but Hozier came back with nothing but a guitar for a final encore.</p>\n<p>For the icing on the cake, the 25-year-old closed out his concert with “Work Song,” a dedication to a lover who has saved him from his troubles. After the band bowed to the audience and the applause came to silence, fans left the Bowl with a renewed appreciation for the old blues. Even though the concert was shorter than was expected, Andrew Byrne-Hozier’s talent is undeniable. With such a level of talent, Hozier is on his way make a legacy for himself with every lyric and melody that he creates.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65652\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/hozier-performs-highly-anticipated-set-at-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65652\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/hozier-performs-highly-anticipated-set-at-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/hozier-performs-highly-anticipated-set-at-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/hozier-performs-highly-anticipated-set-at-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/hozier-performs-highly-anticipated-set-at-sb-bowl/","id":6905,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[6904,6903,6902],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Outside Lands 2015 Highlights","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Friday, August 7th, over 70,000 music fans flooded Golden Gate Park’s Polo Fields for the eighth annual Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival.

As per protocol, on Saturday evening, modern psychedelic garage giants, The Black Keys, were allotted virtually identical set times on the opposite end of the fairgrounds against, perhaps the most influential rapper of Generation Y, Kendrick Lamar.</p>\n<p>Kendrick rewarded fans that managed to escape the Keys’ bluesy licks with one of his most memorable sets. Lamar devotees could be heard chorusing not only smash hits like, “Backseat Freestyle” and “King Kunta,” but also deeper cuts like <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>’s despondent reflection ballad, “Sing About Me.” The electric enthusiasm remained tangible throughout the performance, with the crowd silencing the hip-hop artist’s speeches on more than one occasion with chants of “Kendrick! Kendrick!”</p>\n<p>Before concluding, Lamar began an accolade of his mentor Dr. Dre that lasted nearly five minutes, which stirred many murmurs of the former NWA member’s onstage appearance in the audience. Despite many tweets written before and during the set that proclaim a Dre sighting in the VIP lounge, the hip-hop mogul never manifested on stage leaving crowd members equal parts elated and confused.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64461\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FILMMAGICKENDRICK_01.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"316918028\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64459\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64461\" data-attachment-id=\"64461\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-17/outside-lands-2015-highlights/2015-outside-lands-music-and-arts-festival-twin-peaks-stage-day-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FILMMAGICKENDRICK_01.jpg?fit=4996%2C3372&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4996,3372\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"FilmMagic\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS-1D X\",\"caption\":\"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - AUGUST 08:  Rapper Kendrick Lamar performs at the Twin Peaks Stage during day 2 of the 2015 Outside Lands Music And Arts Festival at Golden Gate Park on August 8, 2015 in San Francisco, California.

The on-stage banter between guitarist Andrew Charles White and bassist Pierce McGarry retained its usual surfer drawl tonality. There was an unshakable feeling that the band didn’t rehearse, but still sounded like they had been born with Fenders in-hand. Longtime Mac DeMarco listeners know that his Saturday afternoon set bore little resemblance to previous shows.</p>\n<p>Mosh pits were nowhere to be found. Mac didn’t take his signature set-concluding crowd surf. Ear-grating guitar solos couldn’t be found. All of this was due to his mini-LP, <em>Another One</em>, a quaint and endearing collection of love songs that DeMarco released on Captured Tracks the day before this performance. And the slow jam feel of this notably breezy concert was a relief. Despite lacking the high energy component DeMarco’s following has come to expect, this live set served as assurance that even though he has new sounds which conjure a very different array of emotions, his songwriting will always bear a stark and enticing sincerity. Also, midway through the set, Mac DeMarco performed an ultra-heavy rendition of Steely Dan’s “Reelin’ in the Years,” as if to remind us that he’s not over shredding.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin Booker:</strong></p>\n<p>It’s tough to have enough to say about this guy. When he speaks, he possesses a meek almost squirrel-ish affect. Although Benjamin Booker is merely 26 years old, his singing voice carries the rasp of a sexagenarian whose primary diet consists of two major food groups — bourbon and cheap tobacco.</p>\n<p>Booker and his two bandmates are a recently formed collaboration coming hot off his self-titled first album in mid-2014. They have since earned gigs performing on KEXP Seattle radio, David Letterman and even touring with Jack White. On-stage, Booker is a powerhouse, often straining his voice into exasperated cracks. During covers of Furry Lewis’ “Falling Down Blues” and Otis Redding’s “Shout Bamalama,” the rocker’s ankle’s twisted, unrestrained manner was reminiscent of a young Presley.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the set-closing song, “Have You Seen My Son,” Booker collapsed to his knees to slam the reverb to the highest setting on each amplifier. Booker and bassist Alex Spoto squared off in a jam for nearly five minutes before uttering a barely audible “thanks” and walking off stage with the strings echoing over the P.A.s.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_64460\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/483525312.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1675017367\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64459\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64460\" data-attachment-id=\"64460\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-17/outside-lands-2015-highlights/2015-outside-lands-music-and-arts-festival-sutro-stage-day-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/483525312.jpg?fit=3000%2C1976&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,1976\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"FilmMagic\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - AUGUST 09:  Singer Benjamin Booker performs at the Twin Peaks Stage during day 3 of the 2015 Outside Lands Music And Arts Festival at Golden Gate Park on August 9, 2015 in San Francisco, California.
