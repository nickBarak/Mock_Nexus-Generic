Spanning two hours, suggestions regarding creating a neighborhood association or a community services district centered Monday’s discussion.</p>\n<p>Since the 1960s, Isla Vista has had difficulty becoming a self-governing entity, failing to pass cityhood attempts three different times in 1973, 1975 and 1984.</p>\n<p>According to Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr, the main issue Isla Vista has with becoming a self-governing entity is finding sustainable funding.</p>\n<p>“We need as much help as we can get from all segments of the community,” Farr said. “It’s really important. I think that we are making strides on infrastructure, but the key baseline issue is sustainable funding.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Isla Vista’s small geographic size and large population density is a challenge towards procuring sustainable funding, Farr said.</p>\n<p>“Traditionally, money comes from property tax, sales tax, [and] bed tax,” Farr said. “Isla Vista doesn’t really have any hotels, so it has no bed tax. It has some sales tax, but not a lot. It’s mainly property tax, but they need to balance that off with the amount of services they need, which is a lot.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista is one of Santa Barbara County’s four pockets of poverty, according to Farr. Because many students and low-income families already struggle to makes ends meet, Farr said it would be unfair to charge them more money.</p>\n<p>Town hall attendee and Isla Vista resident Jeffrey Walsh said that members of all ends of the Isla Vista community need to speak with each other to develop a plan for the future.</p>\n<p>“There’s lots of different, diverse members of the population,” Walsh said. “We felt that it was really important that those groups or stakeholders caucused among themselves because they’re not monolithic groups that are all in agreement with each other.”</p>\n<p>While meetings continue to be planned, former A.S. president Jonathan Abboud said choosing a self-governance option too soon could ultimately hurt the community more than help it.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a smart idea to rush into any one option because it could end up being not what we actually need,” Abboud said, “or it could end up being a little useless, or not as effective as we need it to be.”</p>\n<p>As far as a future community center goes, Farr said the former Redevelopment Agency properties on Embarcadero Del Mar could serve as a potential location.</p>\n<p>“We have things now like the former RDA properties that we managed to hang on to that we can use as a place to provide services to start a beginning community center,” Farr said. “In the future, I’d like to see a big capital campaign where we ultimately would build a really big, new, beautiful community center, and knock these other old buildings down, and have something that would really work with the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, town hall meetings such as Monday’s, where “a broad section of the community [was] represented,” are vital for pushing forward the implementation of concrete plans for Isla Vista’s autonomy.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s terrible it’s taken these tragic events of this year and Deltopia, but there’s been so much renewed energy and focus now on Isla Vista that it is all positive,” Farr said. “I think the future is better and looking up, and I think it’s working at a positive direction.”</p>\n<p><em>The next Isla Vista town hall meeting is scheduled for October 7, 2014. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Office of the EVPLA</em></p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

There was also a crew of juveniles serving out its court-mandated community service hours for the day. The poor suckers had to dig a massive sand pit for an obstacle course the kids used at lunch. I guess not everyone was a volunteer.</p>\n<p>We unloaded trailers full of custom surfboards — some were 18-feet-long with customized wheelchair mounts for handicapped riders — and heaps of wetsuits, lifeguarding surfboards, double-wide boogie boards and heaps of other fine-tuned surf equipment for children with special needs.</p>\n<p>The kids varied in their capabilities and disabilities. Several had developmental disabilities, while several more seemed to have some cognitive impairments, were blind or deaf, battling cancer or phasing out of chemo.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t believe the bravery of those children. Even to someone who has spent his life around it, the ocean is gigantic and unpredictable. And for those kids — some of whom couldn’t even see, some who couldn’t speak, some who had probably never set foot in the ocean and/or demonstrated problems attaining full ranges of physical motion — the sea must’ve been incomprehensible and terrifying at first.</p>\n<p>Trying to steer a surfboard that’s twice or three times the size of your regular board while a newbie surfer perches in front of you is not easy. Not at all. Luckily, the crew of talented volunteers in the water and on the beach were there exclusively to help the kids surf.  We, the volunteers, were their eyes, ears, voices and extra limbs in the water. Every child was assigned to a team of surfers, several of whom would wade or swim next to the child, while one surfer on the extra-sized surfboard rode the wave with the child and stabilized the ride.</p>\n<p>The majority of the time I helped kids onto surfboards and kept close watch to make sure that each child was safe. One particularly striking moment was when this little autistic tyke named Jack, who I was shepherding around the beach, lost his balance and tumbled into my arms. Luckily, the tide was low and I had my feet planted on the bottom so I could hold Jack, but I was completely submerged while I walked to shore holding him over my head above water level. While we didn’t actually speak to each other (Jack wasn’t able to fully articulate coherent speech as part of his autism) the desperate hug that little guy gave me as I carried him to shore before venturing out in the water with him to try again said it all.</p>\n<p>That day, I helped a child without vision stand poised on a surfboard, beaming with all of his face as spray kicked into it. I helped a pack of kids feel, for their first time, the surge of adrenaline that accompanies the tossing and vibrancy of the ocean. I felt the delight of all the volunteers with me firsthand and reveled in our camaraderie, our shared drive to pass our stoke on to those less fortunate.</p>\n<p>It was probably the best day of my life. I state that confidently, without hubris. Not ironically, one of the volunteer organizations participating that October day is named the Best Day Foundation for its efforts.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of my weeklies end along the lighthearted lines of “Go surfing, it’s good for you.” However, sometimes it’s just not that simple. Going surfing isn’t always an easy prospect to tackle.  When you are confronted by special needs such as health conditions, the idea of setting foot in the ocean can seem like a distant hope. That’s why organizations like Ride a Wave and Best Day are crucial. As a volunteer for these philanthropies, you are these children’s natural crutch to lean on.</p>\n<p>I hope those kids remember that day for the rest of their lives. I also hope everyone who reads this takes the time to visit bestdayfoundation.org and rideawave.org to learn how they can contribute to the joy helping others surf. Both organizations have extended their philanthropic efforts nationally.
