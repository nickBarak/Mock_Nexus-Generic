Improvability, UCSB’s improv troupe, will be hosting a Greek-life-themed comedy show this Friday in Embarcadero Hall from 8-11 p.m. Tickets are $3 at the door, and organizers urge students to arrive at 7:45 p.m. to secure their seats. Improvability regularly hosts shows every Friday.</p>\n<p><strong>TO SPEAK FOR THE TREES</strong><br>\nYour Children’s Trees will be planting and maintaining a coastal oak forest at CCBER North Campus Open Space from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday. Organizers advise that interested volunteers bring water and sun protection and wear close-toed shoes and long pants that they don’t mind getting dirty. Biking to the reserve is also recommended. Your Children’s Trees is a student-run environmental organization that hopes to improve coastal runoff and the environment of Santa Barbara by planting trees to create a healthier ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>LITuation</strong><br>\nThe long-awaited Deltopia is upon us, and the LITuation Boyz are kicking it off with a dayger on Saturday from 2-6 p.m. DJs Choppa, P. Diggy and J. Prince will be playing all day, along with currently undisclosed guests. Food will also be sold; guests can purchase chicken or beef tacos for $1.50 each. The party is at 6588 Madrid Rd, and entry is $5 for uninvited guests if ordered in advance or $7 at the door. Wristbands can be picked up at 8 p.m. Thursday at Gio’s.</p>\n<p><strong>TAKE BACK DELTOPIA</strong><br>\nFor those looking to avoid the crowds this weekend, Take Back the Night will be hosting a Deltopia safe space at Pardall Center on Friday from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. and Saturday from 1-6 p.m. April is Sexual Assault awareness month, and everyone is encouraged to go and enjoy a safe and relaxing environment.</p>\n<p><strong>TAKING OUT THE TRASH</strong><br>\nFor those concerned about the environmental impacts of Deltopia, you should be. According to the Coastal Fund, after last year’s Deltopia, 3,247 pounds of trash were picked up off the streets of I.V. This Sunday, Adopt-A-Block and the Coastal Fund will be teaming up to clean up after Deltopia, with the goal of preventing trash from reaching the ocean. The event runs from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at 961 Embarcadero del Mar. Free food and beverages will be provided, and volunteers will be entered into a raffle with prizes from local businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>MEATLESS SUNDAY</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Food Not Bombs is a large organization that spans the country and is a form of “franchise activism.” They believe that corporate and government priorities are skewed and allow hunger despite the abundance of food and food waste. Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76692\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/vista-point-weekly-freebies-and-activities-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76692\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/vista-point-weekly-freebies-and-activities-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/vista-point-weekly-freebies-and-activities-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/vista-point-weekly-freebies-and-activities-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/vista-point-weekly-freebies-and-activities-in-i-v/","id":4446,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4445,4444,4443],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Presence Declines as Deltopia Dwindles","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/police2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/police2.jpg?resize=980%2C451&ssl=1","description":"Police presence during Deltopia will continue to decline this year following dropping attendance levels over the past three years.

Rob Romero said. He said they will be predominantly from southern California UC campuses such as UCLA, UC Irvine, UC San Diego and UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Romero said UCPD had approximately 100 police officers at Deltopia last year.</p>\n<p>This year will also be the first year that UCPD is not installing fencing along El Colegio Road and around residence halls, as the Nexus previously reported.</p>\n<p>Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, said she could not disclose how many officers the Sheriff’s Office will be sending into I.V. this weekend for “safety and security reasons.” She said, however, that there will be less law enforcement personnel than in years past.</p>\n<p>Hoover said the Sheriff’s Office will keep its crowd-control horses “on standby” this weekend, as it did last year.</p>\n<p>“There will still be a strong law enforcement presence. There hasn’t been a dramatic reduction in staff, but we are responding to what we’re seeing, which is a lower number each year, dramatically lower,” she said. “It would be a bit unreasonable to have an unnecessary number of law enforcement in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Police said Deltopia 2016 had a maximum attendance of 3,500 people, a significant decrease from 10,000 attendees in 2015 and 25,000 attendees in 2014.</p>\n<p>The Sheriff’s Office recorded 48 citations and 45 arrests during Deltopia last year, down from 140 citations and 102 arrests in 2015. There were 190 citations and 130 arrests during Deltopia 2014, police said.</p>\n<p>The county festival ordinance will be in place this weekend, prohibiting residents from playing amplified music between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. from Friday to Monday.</p>\n<p>Volunteers from UCIV, a group formed by the Associated Students Public Safety Commission, will ring doorbells and warn Isla Vistans against violating the festival ordinance to prevent police encounters.</p>\n<p>UCSB spent approximately $36,000 on advertisements urging partygoers to stay away from I.V. during Deltopia weekend, university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Estrada said $1,410 of that amount purchased two print ads in the Nexus and $347 purchased an online ad with Mustang News, the student newspaper at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. UCSB’s Office of Public Affairs projects said it has spent approximately $34,000 for digital ads on Facebook, Pandora and Instagram running in areas from San Diego to Paso Robles.</p>\n<p>The university will be enforcing parking restrictions during the weekend. Campus parking officials will be closing all parking lots except Lots 22, 18 and 16.</p>\n<p>Visitors will not be allowed to park in UCSB lots from 11 a.m. Friday to 7:30 a.m. Monday. Only drivers with valid permits are authorized to park on campus.</p>\n<p>The university will also be enforcing a no-guest policy in residence halls from 12 p.m. Friday to 12 p.m. Monday.</p>\n<p>Students will host several alternative programs in and around I.V. during the weekend, including roller skating at the Recreation Center and a concert featuring popular EDM artist RL Grime at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs, said there are talks of making Deltopia a sanctioned event.

The Titans then exploded for five runs in the ninth to close out the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior pitcher Matt Vedo was charged with the loss to even his record at 5-5, while freshman pitcher Grahamm Wiest picked up his fifth win of the season to improve Fullerton’s record to 32-15 (14-4 Big West).</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game meanwhile proved to be the bright point in the week for the Gauchos as they easily defeated Fullerton 7-1 behind a strong bullpen and balanced offensive attack. Vedo struck out five in three scoreless innings for UCSB as he picked up his fifth win of the season.</p>\n<p>“It was a really great win,” senior first baseman Joe Wallace said. “The pitching was great, the offense was great, defense was great, and when all three aspects of the game play well like that together, it usually ends up in a win.”</p>\n<p>Wallace finished the game 2-3 with an RBI double and two stolen bases, while senior left fielder Lance Roenicke hit a two-run home run to power a Gaucho offense that scored 17 runs in the series.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t do too good of a job [hitting] down at Irvine, so we made a commitment to come back up here and pick up our pitching staff,” Wallace said. “We worked hard to do that all week, and we were able to put some runs on the board.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s game proved to be entertaining in the later innings, after UCSB bounced back from a nine-run deficit to eventually lose 9-7. Junior third baseman Marc Venning and sophomore shortstop Brandon Trinkwon each were 1-4 in the game with two RBI each to lead the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior pitcher Kevin Gelinas, Friday’s starting pitcher, was roughed up in the early innings, allowing seven runs and two homers in his 3.2 innings of work.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a big morale boost for us because Fullerton is a pretty good program,” Wilson said. “We’re on our way to being on that level.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to face rival Cal Poly in a three-game series.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/gauchos-drop-series-8-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/gauchos-drop-series-8-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/gauchos-drop-series-8-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/gauchos-drop-series-8-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/gauchos-drop-series-8-fullerton/","id":4448,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[4447,4446,4445],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
