The game against Riverside didn’t go exactly as I thought it would. We came out pretty flat and basically played like shit the first half, but we managed to put together a decent second half and were able to win, which is all that matters really. Now this road trip I don’t think anyone is looking forward to. We’re driving down Tuesday afternoon, playing Wednesday night and driving back to SB after the game Wednesday night only to get back on the bus Thursday around noon to drive back down to LAX for our flight to Utah where we’re playing Utah State on Saturday night for our bracket buster game. Get back on Sunday at some time and then on Tuesday we leave for Long Beach. So it’s gonna be a long week of playing good teams and sitting around the hotel doing jack shit. Can’t believe we have to go back to Utah. Only rThis eason I want to go to Utah is to snowboard. Provo was boring as hell and I don’t have very high expectations for Logan either. Why we are driving back to SB just to go back down to LA less than 12 hours later beats the hell outta me. I suppose it’s for the guys to go to class but let’s be honest here, who is going to attend class when we’re only home for a few hours. Probably only one player and that’s Boswell who’s a mechanical engineering major, so it’s understandable. On another note this is probably the nicest winter we’ve had in SB since I’ve been up here. Knock on wood and hope it continues because it never gets old. Enjoy it while you can because it’s not gonna last forever and it being my last few months here has made me appreciate Santa Barbara even more. That’s all I got for now, gonna throw on my headphones and stare at the oil rigs and islands as we drive down the 101 with Stormin’ Norman at the wheel.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44686\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44686\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/","id":750,"author":{"id":82,"name":"Christian Peterson"},"related":[749,748,747],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":82,"name":"Christian Peterson","biography":"Not available","articles":[739,742,750],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Turn Things Around, Defeat Aztecs at Home to End Losing Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=900%2C596&ssl=1","description":"The drought finally ends for the UCSB women's basketball team after defeating SDSU.

After winning the tip, the Aztecs got things rolling with a Khalia Lark jumper. Lark later hit a three to score five of her team-high 14 points in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos struggled offensively yet again in the first period of play, managing to score only 7 points. Sarah Bates got the Gauchos on the board to tie the game at 2-2, her only points of the quarter.</p>\n<p>A layup and a pair of free throws from redshirt senior Drew Edelman plus a single free throw by Chaya Durr rounded out the Santa Barbara 7-point effort. The Gauchos gave up an 8-1 run to the Aztecs to end the quarter, finding themselves down 16-7 and the subjects of an animated speech from their head coach. In the quarter, Santa Barbara shot a dismal 15.4 field goal percentage while going 0-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Head coach Bonnie Henrickson spoke to her team’s performance after the game; “Sometimes you’ve got to find a way to win and remember how to win, it’s been a while. We’re capable of so much more, we’ve practiced well through all of this.”</p>\n<p>Despite their slow start and disappointing first quarter, the Gauchos turned things around in a major way in the second quarter. Shooting a much-improved 64.3 percent and going 5-of-8 from three-point land helped Santa Barbara put the Aztecs on their heels and take the lead going into halftime.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed energy on the defensive end, getting stops to build momentum as more of their shots fell on the other end. Locking down defensively, UCSB held SDSU to only 10 points in the quarter and forced the Aztecs to shoot 35.7 percent from the field. With 6:45 remaining in the half, Edelman got a layup to go off a nice feed from Sarah Bates to put the Gauchos within a point, 18-17.</p>\n<p>The teams traded buckets until close to the end of the quarter, when Henrickson subbed Tal Sahar into the game. Sahar entered the game with her team down 26-23 at the 2:13 mark. In the final minutes of the half, Sahar gave the Gauchos a 7-0 run to take their first lead of the game.</p>\n<p>The redshirt sophomore leaked out twice for fast break layups and hit a corner three; however, Sahar would not return until the end of the game. UCSB went into halftime with plenty of momentum from their 23-point quarter, up on the Aztecs 30-26.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Edelman spoke to her team’s defensive intensity following the game.</p>\n<p>“Usually the ability to take shots isn’t our problem, it’s definitely on the defensive end,” she said. “We were able to get a lot more stops tonight than we have been able to in the previous nights and also our communication has gotten a lot better.”</p>\n<p>Only up by four at the start of the second half, Santa Barbara found a way to keep its foot on the gas, scoring 27 points in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>With starting freshman point guard Danae Miller getting in foul trouble early, senior guard Makala Roper was tasked with more minutes. Roper controlled the ball and was instrumental in working the ball into Edelman. Henrickson had high praise for her senior guard at the end of the game.</p>\n<p>“[Roper] was really good for really long stretches, I mean really good,” Henrickson said. “She made good decisions with the ball, let go of it, keep it, drive it at the rim, she was good.”</p>\n<p>Edelman herself had a dominant quarter, scoring 15 points on 6-for-7 shooting.</p>\n<p>Roper ended the game with 11 points and a game-high 8 assists. With just over three minutes to go in the quarter, the game was close with the Gauchos up 45-40. Sarah Bates hit a three ball to extend the Santa Barbara lead to 8, then the Gauchos started pouring it on, going on a 12-0 run.</p>\n<p>With Santa Barbara rolling, SDSU was simply outmatched and looked dismantled. Edelman’s 15-point quarter was part of her season-high 25 points, and the talented forward pulled down 10 boards to record a double-double. Shooting 71.4 percent in the quarter, UCSB found itself up on the Aztecs 57-40 heading into the final ten minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter was SDSU’s best, as they score 24 points; however, it wasn’t enough to make the game interesting. Santa Barbara was outscored by four in the quarter, but the Gauchos converted 11 of 12 free throws to finish out the game and secure the victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Sarah Bates played the whole game for Santa Barbara, aside from going to the bench a few seconds before being summoned back due to foul trouble of her teammates. Bates was huge for her team in getting the win. The freshman had 15 points to go along with 7 boards and was a vocal leader on defense.</p>\n<p>In the first time since 1999, Santa Barbara defeated the Aztecs. SDSU struggled carrying out their game plan against the Gauchos, losing the battle in the paint by a ten-point deficit and being outrebounded 35-23.</p>\n<p>McKynzie Fort, the Aztecs’ leading scorer on the season, was handled well by the Santa Barbara defense, as she was held to just 10 points and a single rebound in 38 minutes.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now have a short break for the holidays before returning to action for its last non-conference game against New Mexico State next Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/gauchos-turn-things-around-defeat-aztecs-at-home-to-end-losing-streak/","id":747,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[746,745,744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts No. 71 Nevada, Pacific to Begin Homestand","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Margarita-Baliyan_2.9.14_-MensTennis-25-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Margarita-Baliyan_2.9.14_-MensTennis-25-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces Pacific this weekend, the team it beat in last year's Big West Tournament championship game.

Galskov will be expected to lead the team this weekend as he impressed in his new role at the top of the lineup, winning his match over junior Sai Kartik Nakireddi 4-6, 6-2, 7-6.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos also hope to improve in their doubles play, having lost the doubles point in six straight matches. In order to win upcoming matches, they will need to take the first point in the overall match and push the momentum in order to beat these top teams.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing entertaining matches,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “They’re close; we’d like to be on the other side of a few more of them.”</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday, Nevada had won its last four matches and is 5-2 overall, defeating Cal Poly, USF, Arizona and Grand Canyon. The team is led by junior Moaz Chargui in the top singles spot followed by senior Victor Ouvrard, sophomore Andrew Poustie and senior Quentin Mege. The top doubles pairs will consist of Echargui and Mege, Ouvrard and freshman Robert Allan and Poustie with junior Fernando Sunago.</p>\n<p>“Nevada has a lot of international players, very steady, don’t make a lot of unforced errors and [they are] very good,” Davis said. “I expect it to be a very close match.”</p>\n<p>Nevada played Pepperdine last night and will return home for a stretch of matches at its home court after playing UCSB.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Pacific will be coming into Santa Barbara looking for vengeance after the Gauchos knocked the Tigers out of the Big West Tournament last spring. Though no longer in the Big West Conference, the Tigers will be another tough test for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Tigers are 3-5 overall and won their last match over Sacramento State 7-0. They will be playing Cal Poly on Saturday before coming down the 101 to take on the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We edged this team in the finals last year for the conference title,” Davis said. “They aren’t in our conference anymore but I’m sure they will all remember that. I’m sure they’ll be looking for some revenge.”</p>\n<p>Pacific is led by its star sophomore Sem Verbeek. Verbeek was named Big West Conference Freshman of the Year in 2013. He also was named to the All-Big West First Team and earned All-Big West First Team for doubles with his partner Alex Golding, who has since graduated. Verbeek will be playing doubles this year with his new partner, freshman Miguel Diaz.</p>\n<p>Following Verbeek in the lineup will be sophomore Daniel Alameh, junior Denis Stolyarov, Diaz, junior Ben Mirkin and junior Alex Hamilton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos look to end their losing ways starting today at 1:30 p.m. against Nevada and then take on Pacific at 1 p.m. on Sunday. Both matches will be played at the tennis courts behind the Recreational Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-hosts-no-71-nevada-pacific-to-begin-homestand/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-hosts-no-71-nevada-pacific-to-begin-homestand/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-hosts-no-71-nevada-pacific-to-begin-homestand/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-hosts-no-71-nevada-pacific-to-begin-homestand/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-hosts-no-71-nevada-pacific-to-begin-homestand/","id":748,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[747,746,745],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Tough Decision to San Jose State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.26.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB dropped a 4-3 decision on the road against San Jose State this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis traveled to the Bay Area on Saturday to face San Jose State and dropped a tough decision 4-3. Santa Barbara was looking for a win in San Jose, which would have resulted in its first two-game win streak of the season. However, San Jose outlasted UCSB and dropped the Gauchos to a 2-8 record overall with a 1-1 conference record. Meanwhile with the victory, the Spartans boosted themselves to 5-8 overall.</p>\n<p>The day started well for the Gauchos, who split the singles matches 3-3. UCSB’s junior Stacy Yam defeated junior Julianna Bacelar of SJSU at the fourth spot 6-4, 6-2. Santa Barbara freshman Jaimee Gilbertson beat junior Jessica Willett of San Jose 6-3, 6-4 at the fifth spot and sophomore Luisa Ortiz Candido was victorious over freshman Tipper Truong 6-2, 6-1.</p>\n<p>The match was to be decided by the doubles matches, a section where the Gauchos have been trying to improve significantly.
