The deeply personal documentary follows Crosby along his latest solo music tour, while diving into his past in Crosby Stills Nash and Crosby Stills Nash and Young. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that Crosby is alive, let alone has maintained his clear harmonizing voice well after his glory days of the ‘70s and ‘80s, is a miracle noted by television interviews, individuals featured in the film and Crosby himself. He is of course known today for his memorable career as a singer-songwriter, but also for his heroin and cocaine addictions and famed run from the law. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">released this summer about the ‘70s and ‘80s singer Linda Ronstadt </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels so different from “Remember My Name</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because of Ronstadt’s silence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s considerable intersection between the careers of Linda Ronstadt and David Crosby. Both came out of high school to the late-1960s Los Angeles music scene with a burning passion to share their voice, trying to carve their way into a path dominated by the British music invasion as well as the national tumult post-Vietnam. Singer-songwriter rock was king, and Crosby and Ronstadt frequented many of the same music clubs like the Troubadour and befriended icons like Mama Cass and Joni Mitchell, hoping to break their way in. Both artists quickly did — Ronstadt through her successful solo career including hits like “Blue Bayou” and “You’re No Good” and Crosby under The Byrds; Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (CSN); and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (CSNY). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Crosby and Ronstadt have a unique talent and voice. Both have bold, larger-than-life personalities, daring to take creative risks and to speak their mind about politics and overall not giving a damn. Both had a distaste for touring, or anything that distracted from the heart and soul of their passion —  making music. Both shared a deep loneliness throughout their career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But looking at “Remember My Name”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and “The Sound of My Voice”, that’s where the similarities end. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the two performers may be from the same era, in 2019 they lead entirely different lives, and the two documentaries produced are stylized to reflect that difference; Crosby still louder than life, Ronstadt now silent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ronstadt’s lack of appearance throughout the documentary can be traced to the abrupt end of her career eight years ago due toParkinson’s disease. “The Sound of My Voice” is about looking back on the time Ronstadt had, a closing bow to her successful career and the legacy she’s left behind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see Ronstadt’s vivacious spirit not through her present but through her past, specifically in television interview clips and concert recordings. But the prime stylistic difference in the Ronstadt and Crosby documentaries is their physical presence in the film. We only actually see the current Ronstadt in the beginning and the end of the film. She’s been exceptionally private since her 2011 Parkinson’s diagnosis and didn’t allow an on-camera interview for the film. The sound of her voice is heard throughout the film (making the film’s title that much more fitting) through narration from one topic to the next, but the end result reflects the guarded nature of the subject. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Remember My Name”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the exact opposite. Crosby himself drives the film, and the result feels far more autobiographical than Ronstadt’s film. In one particularly exceptional section of the film, Crosby is in the back seat of a car, stopping at some of the most prolific spots in the Los Angeles and Laurel Canyon area that shaped his career. He’s never one to shy from intimacy, and some of the most touching and candid discussions of those he’s hurt in the past come outside a small country store, what he calls the “least cinematic” of places. There’s a spontaneity to having a quasi-unreliable narrator as your star, and Crosby never hides from his fall from grace. Director A.J. Eaton, along with executive producer Cameron Crowe, establish a close rapport with Crosby, making you feel like you truly understand Crosby’s story by the time the credits roll. Eaton told Melena Ryzik, New York Times culture reporter, that his relationship unfolded naturally with Crosby: “the music was fresh, he was trying new things, and we became friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Remember My Name”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is not Crosby’s final bow, but the opening of an entirely new second act. Crosby’s not done with his life; his solo career is proving what he can do with the time he has left. It’s the opposite of slowing down; he has produced four albums in the past four years and is currently working on his fifth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key stylistic difference between the two films is how their stories are told. Because Ronstadt wasn’t interviewed for the film, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman supplement partially with old footage of Ronstandt, but mainly through interviews of others, including former bandmates and collaborators. And not one has a bad thing to say about Linda. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Crosby stands alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Remember My Name” features few and far between interviews of other people, and Eaton didn’t even ask the members of CSNY to be in the film. The film isn’t a reflection (like with Ronstadt’s film), but a way for Crosby to share his side of the story. Just like with every other topic he tackles, Crosby is candid about his estrangement from Neil Young, Graham Nash and Stephen Stills, as well as other big music names who he fought throughout his career and addictions. Crosby’s story is a fall from grace and a decades-in-the-making rise. Ronstadt never falters. She just sings until she tragically can’t. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When comparing the films, you can’t help but see the irony in where the two rock stars have landed based on where they’ve been. If the world was just, it would be Ronstadt still singing; she steered clear of the male-dominated rock scene fueled by hard drugs and rock star image in favor of keeping her voice clean. Instead, she is left silenced by Parkinson’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The rock and roll culture seems to be dominated by hostility against women. What happens is they lose the ability to focus on themselves as a person, rather than as an image,” Ronstandt says to a reporter in an old interview along the Malibu coast in her beachside home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crosby in his prime rockstar era was the type of man Ronstadt references in that interview. He spent his prime years “smashed,” as he often describes in the film, and CSN and CSNY was built on an image that looked ideal from the outside but was actually filled with decades-long hostility culminating in their 2016 breakup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering Crosby’s rock star attitude, and especially his heavy drug usage, he should be the one silenced — not Ronstadt. Yet he still has time to sing, and the core of “Remember My Name” is how Crosby’s second act is a refusal to give up his voice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coincidentally, the films share a handful of producing credits: Gabriel Caste, Alex Exline, Michele Farinola and James Keach (both films were made by his production company, PCH Films). Editor Veronica Pinkham also worked on both films, as a co-editor on “Remember My Name” and additional editing on “The Sound of My Voice”. Cameron Crowe, a prominent music journalist and filmmaker from the 1970s, was interviewed for “The Sound of My Voice” and was a producer on “Remember My Name,” interviewing Crosby himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What the two share behind the scenes in no way leads to a similar final products of the films. That’s the beauty of documentaries — that these two stories, which on the surface appear the same, about rock stars from the same era grappling with fame and all it entails, quickly blossom into completely different films that set out with completely different aims and ways of achieving them. Both do their subjects the justice they so deserve. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Correction [Oct. 2, 11:42 p.m.]: A previous version of this article did not include that Michele Farinola and Veronica Pinkham worked on both films, and stated Crowe was an executive producer for “Remember My Name”.

Terrifying, devastating and ultimately stunning, “Joker” will probably leave you speechless in the theater seat, trying to pull yourself together and come to grips with the journey into madness you just watched.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Todd Phillips, the director behind the script and camera, teams up with Joaquin Phoenix in this violent, gritty character study to deliver a film that is painful and magnificent, worthy of telling the story of this infamous comic book character. Phoenix in the spotlight feels irreplaceable, completely reinventing himself for the role in a way that shapes out to be perhaps the best performance of his acting career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set in the iconic streets of Gotham City — but this time in the 1980s — we see a mentally ill man named Arthur Fleck, played by Phoenix, struggle to find a place in a society that seems to reject him at every turn. Arthur’s condition, one that makes him burst into fits of laughter (often at the worst possible moments), pushes him further and further away from the world around him. And now, with his social services cut and his medication gone, Arthur has nothing — and his journey into insanity begins.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phoenix is undoubtedly the crown jewel of this movie, delivering one of the most Oscar-worthy performances I’ve ever seen. Having said to have eaten little more than an apple a day for this role, he is a frail skeleton of a man in this movie whose hopelessness and deep sadness weigh heavy in his face and shoulders. His eyes fill with pain as he desperately tries to stop his laughter, which is often misunderstood and leads Arthur into dangerous situations with unsympathetic characters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the limp scuffle that defines a defeated Arthur’s walk to a soon-to-be-iconic bathroom dance scene, Phoenix masterfully plays into the idiosyncrasies of a scared child transforming into a sociopathic monster. Inhabiting this role with every fiber of his being, he manages to leave the character with more life and utter insanity than how he found it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeking complete creative freedom, Phillips set this movie in a different universe entirely, one in which the Joker’s life could be honestly and wholeheartedly explored. The slow-burn plot and the graphic violence, however, make crucial room for an origin story that has for too long been lazily reduced to “he fell into a vat of chemicals.” This is the riveting, no-holds-barred character exploration that Batman fans have always wanted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is the ultimate fan service for Batman aficionados who’ve always wanted a standalone movie for the Joker and manages to hold onto the nostalgia and callous insanity that made the Joker such a beloved villain to begin with. It tells this story with the quiet intensity of a crackling vinyl, taking you through a terrifying journey into the Joker’s mind. As you watch that twisted smile finally come to the Joker’s face in the end while Frank Sinatra’s “Send in the Clowns” plays, you won’t be able to look away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

virtual gifts and money. That’s right, imagine a world where your idols no longer acquire income from ad sponsorships, but from you directly — this is the case in China’s livestreaming platform YY. Recently, UC Santa Barbara’s Pollock Theater screened “People’s Republic of Desire,” a documentary that presents an alternate perspective of China’s livestreaming universe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term “livestreaming” refers to online media that is simultaneously recorded and broadcast in real time. Since introducing livestreaming on various media platforms, it has gained popularity worldwide and has grown to become a primary source of entertainment, and most recently, a primary source of income as well. Livestreaming in China has had the most effect and impact on their youth population, who comprise the majority of the fanbases for many online personalities. The ability for online personalities to record and broadcast their lives in real time allows for a virtual connection to be made with their dedicated fans.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People’s Republic of Desire” follows the lives and struggles of two specific livestreamers, Shen Man and Big Li, on the Chinese livestreaming platform YY. This documentary covers the lives of these young performers who use the virtual connections between their fans as their main source of income through lavish gifts. The demographics of their fans range from people in the lower class (usually migrant workers) to the higher class in China — two groups with very different reasons to follow these livestreamers. For the lower class audience, these performers are a source of entertainment and inspiration since most of the livestreamers have shared similar life experiences as those of the migrant worker fans. As for the higher class audience, being able to control a performer’s actions through monetary influence puts them in a place of power they are accustomed to and yearn for constantly. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mind behind the film is director Hao Wu. “People’s Republic of Desire” is one of several documentaries Wu has created with the intention of showing alternative sides of the story in relation to media coverage in modern Chinese society. Wu decided to focus this specific documentary, “People’s Republic of Desire,” on the youth of China, since they will be shaping and shifting the future. As seen in the film, Wu also focuses on the social division between the wealthy and lower class youth to portray the kind of inequality that divides China.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90577\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/variety.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1288355146\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"90575\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90577\" data-attachment-id=\"90577\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-23/director-hao-wu-accompanies-documentary-screening-at-pollock-theater/variety/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/variety.jpg?fit=1000%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,563\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"variety\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/variety.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/variety.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90577\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/variety.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/variety.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/variety.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/variety.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SXSW</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Wu was young, telling stories has always been his passion. The documentaries that Wu has created have functioned as an outlet for him to tell stories of the modern Chinese culture and society. Even though he began his career as a trained microbiologist, Wu explored different sectors of business and high technology throughout his life, as well as directing his own personal projects on the side. His involvement with high technology was what first introduced him to the livestreaming platform YY. After research within his network, he was able to obtain the permissions from the founder of YY to produce “People’s Republic of Desire” and bring an important part of China’s recent history to the attention of the rest of the world. Wu began this project around 2014, stopped filming in 2016 and then finally released the documentary in 2018. At the time, livestreaming in China had reached its peak. Currently, livestreaming is definitely an important aspect of society as it is in the states today, however the fanbase has decreased since the launch and rise of the Chinese app TikTok.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the rest of the crowd and I relaxed into our seats at the film screening event last Thursday night at Pollock Theater, we got to enter this world of virtual reality ourselves . It quickly became apparent that the film’s events were like a real-life “Black Mirror” episode as director Wu encompasses the life of fame, isolation and materialism of the livestreaming sector in China.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wu’s “Black Mirror”-inspired documentary brought forth a science fiction appeal as he tried to explain the complex social livestreaming system that is YY. During the Q&amp;A segment following the screening, Wu addressed how he needed to find a way to simplify the YY platform and that making certain post-production decisions allowed him to properly explain this complicated system to unfamiliar eyes. Wu pointed out that throughout the film he refrained from showing full shots of the livestreaming website, creating his own virtual version of it that worked to simplify how the process works and how online celebrities earn money from it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wu acknowledged that this idea and business model of monetizing the virtual interactions between online celebrities and their fans might seem odd at first but actually very honest overall. This same business model is present worldwide with slight differences. For example, here in the United States, YouTubers and Instagram stars gain their money from private companies through ad sponsorships, but in the end they still earn money to sell an image — the only difference is the money doesn’t come directly from their fans. The truth is that this business model has been adapted worldwide as many private companies have been using livestreaming as their main source of income regardless of their main objective, whether it is dating sites or video games. “People’s Republic of Desire” opens the eyes of the viewer to a phenomena that is not only occurring in China but worldwide, as it also uncovers specific aspects of the general Chinese society.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-93475\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of New On Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was 13 years old when I first read Jennifer Niven’s depressing book “All the Bright Places</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” Like any other young teenager, I was going through a tumultuous and emotionally exhausting phase, yet my middle school years were also graciously filled with many young adult fiction books including “The Fault in Our Stars</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” “Divergent” and “The Hunger Games.” Luckily all of these books became movies right when I needed them to, but it’s better late than never for Netflix to finally release an “All the Bright Places”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">screen adaptation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story focuses on Violet Markey (Elle Fanning) and Theodore Finch (Justice Smith, who recently starred in “Pokemon: Detective Pikachu”), who slowly become friends through Finch’s avid push for a connection, and ultimately develop a romantic relationship. The film shows a typical high school setting, with teenage tropes like cliques and bullying, mostly aimed at Finch who’s labeled as a “freak.” Yet still, the movie pushes the limits of audience expectations as it shows high schoolers dealing with mental illness and mourning — topics that have become more mainstream in the past few years but are still taboo in many respects. At the start of the film, Finch plausibly saves Violet from jumping off a bridge, which she initially doesn’t appreciate. Violet later reveals her suicidal thoughts were due to the 19th birthday of her sister Eleanor, who died in a car crash at the bridge while Violet survived.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After this almost deadly encounter, Finch pursues Violet, but she denies his constant pleas to be partners for a school project and ignores his questions and greetings. Eventually, Finch is able to convince Violet to be his partner for the assignment to visit two wonders of their great state of Indiana. His upbeat and bold personality melts her cold facade, and Violet begins to open up to Finch because she realizes that she still has her life to live. Previously, she had stopped interacting with friends, refused to get into cars and overall halted her life because she couldn’t move on from her sister’s death – but Finch changes all that. While the beginning of the film presents Violet as the one who needs help, Finch’s own depression begins to unfold after the two begin to date. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I find that watching sad films forces you to put yourself in the character’s shoes because you have grown attached to them in the 90-120 minutes you’ve spent with them, and so I felt terribly for Violet. Other shows and films today touch on mental illness but fail to accurately display its effects or they misguidedly romanticize it. “All the Bright Places”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could’ve dived deeper into Finch’s depression, but it also demonstrated how sometimes people think they’re doing better than they are, and while their family and friends should help fix them, sometimes they can’t. Finch fell through the cracks — and perhaps Violet should’ve been paying more attention, but it is important to realize that his death was in no way her fault. He needed more help, he couldn’t control his mental illness by himself and in the end, he stopped trying. Violet closes the film with Finch’s wise teaching: “There can be bright places even in dark times. And if there isn’t… you can be that bright place with infinite capacities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the film was a bit slow, especially at the beginning, and it missed so many great points from the novel. Perhaps I am biased because I think books are always better than their on-screen adaptations, but there is so much more room for detail in a book than there is time in a film. The acting was adequate, and even though Fanning has held superb roles, I was disappointed with her presentation of Violet. The screenplay was well written, and it did include some of the more iconic quotes from the novel — or at least enough for any fan of the book to be satisfied. No one will miss out on much if they never watch it, but some weekends just call for movie marathons with your friends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall rating: ★★★☆☆</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.
