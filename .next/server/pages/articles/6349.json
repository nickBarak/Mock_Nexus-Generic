You may be lying blissfully in bed when your partner of x-months asks you timidly, “So, are we exclusive?” Don’t panic. Don’t push them away. Don’t think, “God, there’s the end of a good thing.” I am all for being casual, if that’s what you want. And I absolutely agree that labels can be harmful to your relationship if they are forced or both members aren’t prepared for them. But labels are not something to overreact about. Rather, they are something that should be earnestly considered. You all have your varying notions on reasons for shunning or embracing labels and I’m going to address them as best I can. Sit tight.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, labels provide parameters and a good gauge of emotional investment. So often, people remain tight-lipped about what they’re actually feeling. It’s like a competition for who can be the most casual, or care the least. So, it’s ridiculously difficult to gauge whether or not your partner is taking you seriously or really likes you. Thus, the importance of labels. Bear with me.</p>\n<p>The talks you have with your partner will vary depending upon your relationship. I personally cannot stand the idea of dating someone for six months and having them still be only your “hookup buddy.” That’s half a year. That’s bullshit. If that’s all they’re keeping you for, they are not taking you seriously. And maybe you’re okay with that, and you want to keep it there. But if you’re emotionally attached, you need to prioritize what you want out of the relationship. I had to watch my friend put her partner’s feelings over her own for months. She wanted to be this relaxed, casual girl for him and, in doing so, she refused to tell him what she actually wanted. If you want something, tell them. Your partner is not a mind reader. When I was three weeks or so into dating my boyfriend, I asked him whether he considered our relationship casual or if he saw it going anywhere. If he said casual, that would have been a bummer, but at least I would have known and I would have been able to behave appropriately. That is the preliminary label you need to jump over. Know what they want out of your relationship so you don’t moon over them pointlessly.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Later comes the exclusive/girlfriend line dance. After a loud and heated debate with a pack of dudes, I think I have a fair idea of the struggle between these terms. When deciding whether to remain exclusive or making their partner a girlfriend, the guys saw it as a pointless transition. It wouldn’t change anything; they already considered their partners at the level of girlfriend and didn’t understand the difference in connotation. However, the way I view it is like this: a girl you’re exclusive with is certainly close to girlfriend status. But being a girlfriend signifies that you are ready to open yourself up emotionally. Exclusive means you don’t have to worry about whether they’re dipping their chip into someone else’s dip or not. But girlfriend means that they’ll tell you about their childhood, their disappointments, their secrets and the extent of their feelings for you. It’s taking the next emotional step. And if there really is no difference, what’s holding you back from just saying it? If nothing really changes, what’s the problem? It will make them happier and there is the opportunity for more emotional satisfaction. I’m not the kind of person who will wait around months just to be a slam piece, and neither should you. Take yourself seriously and tell others what you want from your romantic endeavors or accept that it will sit still as long as you let it. Deuces, and happy humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. ain’t no holla’ back girl.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/casualornot.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\"

stupid to the majority of you (unless you’re of the male gender, in which case I bet you’re just as stoked as I am), but give me a minute and listen to what I mean before you judge my process. I, being a heterosexual man, love women, beer and Batman and the combination of these three things will be what I live for until the day I die, but that’s not what I’m trying to get at here. Although these three steps seem like a joke, they each attack central problems that plague relationships: insecurity, selfishness and seriousness. If you give yourself over to my system for just one week, you’re in for a closer, more intimate and much, MUCH more pleasurable experience with your partner.

This means saying what you like, how you like it, when you like it, where you like it and not being afraid to be the initiator and get specific with your boy.</p>\n<p>Sexy-sneak-attack him next time he walks in the door: put on some of his favorite lingerie, tackle him onto your bed (counter, table, couch, floor — the list goes on), proceed to take off said lingerie and then do all those things that you said you’d save for his birthday. He’ll be living the dream, and I bet you he’ll do his best to make sure you feel the same.</p>\n<p>Then, when it’s his turn, tell him if all he’s doing is bouncing around like a kid in a Jolly Jump. I promise you that it’s better to say in the moment, “That’s not doing anything for me; put your back into it.” If you wait for him to look up one time and see you staring blank-faced at the clock, counting minutes while he’s busy thinking he’s blowing your mind (sore subject), you’re only losing out on your own pleasure and destroying his manhood.</p>\n<p>What I’m trying to say is you need to be completely naked in each sense of the word every time you show up to play with your man, or it will definitely be embarrassing for one of you, probably him. A combination of insecurity and shame does not make a night one to remember, for the right reasons at least.</p>\n<p>Part 2: Bring Beer.</p>\n<p>Although beer is the golden blood of happiness and does actually make the world go round, I don’t mean that you can make him happy just by bringing him beer (certainly helps, though). On this one I mean you need to think about what you bring to the table when push comes to shove. If you’re not doing the pushing or the shoving, you need to seriously reevaluate your sexual tactics.</p>\n<p>Basically, take into consideration that guys need to feel like they’re being taken care of — not babied, but taken care of.</p>\n<p>Part 3: Batman.</p>\n<p>Remember his fantasies. Chances are that your man is not Christian Grey and does not dream of tying you to a telephone post while using some medieval torture device to get off. However, if Mr. Grey is actually your man, then please disregard this section.</p>\n<p>Every single boy has dreams of different freaky ways he wishes he could get it on and most of them are harmless and exciting. The problem is that far too often, these fantasies are disregarded because the act itself is “good enough.” I’m here to tell you that if you let him wear his Batman mask and talk in the Dark Knight’s voice as he explores your Batcave with his Batmobile, you will have given that man a memory to be cherished until the end of time.</p>\n<p>All I want to say on this one is, take his fantasies into consideration next time you are trying to enjoy yourselves, and I’m sure he’ll remember it the next time he has the opportunity to return the favor.</p>\n<p>Men are not impossible to figure out; take care of them and they’ll take care of you.</p>\n<p><em>E.

There’s a damn good chance someone is going to see your ass bobbing up and down in the lewdest of ways. You’re at your most vulnerable, naked and writhing, and the possibility that you could be reprimanded is high. The adrenaline is intoxicating. Not only that, but I adore the spontaneity of it: your partner can’t wait to get home to mash your nasties together and simply must have you on the grass, right here, right now. That hunger, that deviousness, that breathless giggling — these are the most delicious aspects of public sex. However, like all adrenaline-inducing activities, it’s always good to have a game plan. So, below, I entail my recommendations for your racy romp, particularly focusing on locale, with other kernels of knowledge littered throughout.</p>\n<p>Finding a proper place is perhaps the most important and trying aspect of sex away from home. It has to be an appropriate balance of being risky and concealed. “If you are for sure going to be caught, that’s scary. I doubt I could get it up. But with a little bit of risk, that’s fun,” said one lewd friend to another. I do not recommend the beach. Sure, it sounds romantic, but do you really want sand in your crevices? Just imagine a handful of tiny, salty rocks in your cooch. Sorry ladies, but that sand is not going to blossom into a beautiful pearl one day. That stuff will rub and chafe and cut as your partner pokes your insides. It can lead to infections, and it’s just not cute. What I think you really want from beach sex is to hear the crashing of the waves: que romantico. Below is a comprehensive list of all the places I would recommend …</p>\n<p>The Library (Obviously):</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This is on everyone’s to-do-him/her list. Let the record show that if you do it in the bathroom where you can lock the doors (ahem, Dylan), it doesn’t count, and I decree your boning null and void. Well, save for the joy of insertion, props to that. It must be an open space, wherein anyone could see your moon-pale ass. Double points if you do it while watching the sunset over your partner’s wobbling shoulder (high-fives self).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Park:</p>\n<p>As I said, the beach is a cliché and can lead to some wicked chafing. Instead, try one of Isla Vista’s many poorly-lit parks. Maybe bring a blanket and “enjoy the cool night air.” Or, even better, the bluffs. Not only will it be private (in case the thought of being caught makes you too nervous to perform) but you can listen to the waves intermingle with your partner’s erratic breathing. Let me just add, however, that a confidant of mine recommended not to do it on the bench by Window-to-the-Sea. You think it’s a good idea, but it’s not.</p>\n<p>The Roof:</p>\n<p>Specifically, the tops of school buildings. Similar to the thrill of library sex, you can make the double-backed beast atop the halls of academia with less of a risk and more of a note of novelty. This may be the top of the Life Sciences building, the top of HSSB or any other building that you can get-it-on-top-of.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more specific to my freshman frolickers, try behind San Miguetto, on the side facing Manzanita. Outside the stairway on that side of the building, there is a pocket blocked from external view that you can fiddle in. Just don’t all go at once.

Sure, you might run into that hunky hulk in the workplace, but odds are that your choice of lover from such an enclosed setting will be risqué, unnecessary and reputation-ruining. Kudos to you if the office adventure blossoms into a beatific bond, but try to steer away from potential gossip and awkward encounters in a place in which you wish to excel professionally.</p>\n<p>His: Ask yourself one question: Is there a future for you where you’re working? If yes, you two are probably going to be seeing each other everyday for years to come, so don’t get sensual. But if you’re just working at the local McDonald’s while you’re home for summer, and she’s giving you the signs … ain’t nothing wrong with a little bump ‘n grind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Friends</p>\n<p>Hers: Ah, this one can get sticky. Have a feel — actually, have a good grope — for your pal’s “friends with benefits” mindset. Set guidelines. Unless you don’t give a flying fuck how your relationship with the amorous amigo turns out post-naughtiness, then be sure you differentiate emotional intimacy from skin-timacy. Have fun, but know what you want. Sometimes seeing the banging buddy get along well with your friends and family can shoot you straight into a world of feelings and attachment. And that, my reader, is when the stickiness doesn’t wash off.</p>\n<p>His: If she’s close enough to know your family dog’s name is Harvey Dent, you would have to gamble your friendship on whether or not you two will work as a couple. Chances are you will not be able to have casual sex with that kind of pre-existing emotional attachment; you’ll either become a great couple or just an awkward pair of people who have now seen each other naked and don’t know how to feel about it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First Date</p>\n<p>Hers: The questions I would ask are: “How horny are you?” and “How inhumanly irresistible is your date?” I must admit that I’ve committed the first date love-makin’ once before. The relationship that ensued was beautiful, but the physicality diluted the mental connection we shared. So let’s make this a no-no. If you want that bod, just ask for the bod. If you can’t get that bod, then that’s not my problem.</p>\n<p>His: Unless you’re 2 Chainz and you “love bad bitches” and that’s your “fuckin’ problem,” you’ll most likely agree that it’s risky to light the candles and whip out the Marvin Gaye on day one for a couple of reasons.</p>\n<p>1. Sleaze factor: You can’t help but wonder that if she’s ready for me on day one, who else is getting this kind of treatment?</p>\n<p>2. The Natural Order: It’s much easier to become friends before the first hump than it is to try to go back and get to know each other afterwards. You might feel satisfied, but you’ll probably never know if she shares your love for Batman.</p>\n<p>Just think if you’re in it for tonight or tomorrow.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Party</p>\n<p>Hers: For me, kissing competency is a huge turn on or off factor. Slobber fest in my mouth? Good bye and good riddance. But for the others who don’t predestine their party sexcapades by an oral ultimatum, I say, “Why not?” Check for lumps and sores, make sure the condom is on, and let your inner beast free.</p>\n<p>His: It’s rare to hear people say, “thank god for what I did last night” after a sloppy hookup in I.V. Don’t ruin your reputation over a drunken, possibly infectious and probably terrible one-nighter. Unless you’re just out looking for a crazy night and sure that you won’t be leaving with any new diseases, I say keep it safely stowed. That is, of course, unless you’re 2 Chainz.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Exes</p>\n<p>Hers: There’s a reason why you two broke up in the first place. Hold firm and demand some respect for yourself; there are plenty of other (better) fish in the sea. Unless you both have engaged in major self-improvement, chances are that if the relationship didn’t work the first time, it won’t work the second. But if you’re not trying to get back at what you let go and all you want is a thrustin’ thrill, just keep in mind that he’s filling you now, but he don’t fulfill you.</p>\n<p>His: Think of yourself and your ex as pieces of silly putty. No matter how many times you separate, as soon as you touch each other new strings of connected putty are going to try to hold you two together. Unless you definitely want to get back together, or you love a dramatic lifestyle, don’t mix your putty with putties of the past.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Best Friends’ Exes</p>\n<p>Hers: I see no problem in this. If you’ve got the feels for your homie’s ex — and these are real feels, mind you — then go for it. Communicate with your bestie, gauge her reactions, be sensitive toward her thoughts and if the green’s a-go, you press that gas pedal. As they say, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. It wouldn’t be fair to discriminate against the treasure based on who it first belonged to, now would it?</p>\n<p>His: If you’ve got an itch that nothing but your best friend‘s ex can scratch, talk to your friend, think about the awkwardness and finally consider the fact that your best friend spent a good deal of time riding that very same rollercoaster that you’re now waiting in line for. Hopefully by the time you’ve pondered these things, you’ll have realized that it is just a god-awful idea. If you’re still like “Meh, I bet it’d be just fine,” you’re ignorant. Don’t be stupid.</p>\n<p><em>R. Pengsta and E.
