Now that the appellate court has definitively rejected this argument, the university calls on the administration to stop its efforts to rescind the program.”</p>\n<p>Under the Trump Administration, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke initially motioned to eliminate the DACA program in September 2017.</p>\n<p>Duke argued the program was “illegal from its inception” under the Obama Administration.</p>\n<p>UC <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-08/breaking-uc-files-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-for-unlawful-daca-repeal/\">filed a lawsuit</a> challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to repeal the program shortly after.</p>\n<p>The DACA program allows undocumented residents who were brought into the U.S. as children to apply for “two-year renewable periods” allowing them to stay in the U.S.</p>\n<p>In order to be eligible to apply, individuals must have clean criminal records and meet “various educational or military service requirements,” court documents state.</p>\n<p>In wake of Thursday’s decision, UC urged all eligible DACA recipients to renew their grants.</p>\n<p>“While today’s ruling is welcome news, we stress that DACA recipients deserve better than to see their life prospects rise and fall based on events in litigation.

One person had heard of the plans, but knew no additional information.</p>\n<p>The respective projects both have running starts, but do they have what it takes to get off the ground?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Associated Students’ Sustainable Restaurant</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Associated Students plans to invest a quarter of a million dollars of student money to establish an organic, local food operation at 6521 Pardall Rd.</p>\n<p>The restaurant — which would take over the space of the now-defunct On The Side — would produce approximately 35 to 50 student jobs and, while it would create revenue, would not be run on a strictly profit-generating platform. Legislative Council representatives Fabian Gallardo and Stanley Tzankov, an A.S. presidential candidate, started pushing the enterprise last quarter.</p>\n<p>While delegates indicated that the $250,000 is being loaned out for the plan from a reserve account under the control of Business Services, as of press time, student representatives have given the Daily Nexus conflicting reports about the money’s source.</p>\n<p>The four students of the Business Services committee — including Gallardo, the committee chair — voted in favor of the loan, Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>“The reserve account was created in 2006 during the students’ initiative as a mandate for an environmental center,” Gallardo said. “A large focus of the restaurant will be towards environmental education, hence the strong involvement of the Student Food Collective.”</p>\n<p>However, A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez, said the Business Services loan is coming from the A.S. Bike Reserve — funds that were allocated a number of years ago for the A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>Part of the $250,000 will be allocated to an outside individual recommended by the A.S. attorney to create a business plan with the rest going toward “holding down” a lease, said Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said there was a discussion about loaning against other A.S. accounts.</p>\n<p>“We currently have an account devoted towards the construction of a permanent bike shop, since our current one is in a trailer,” Elwood said. “It was proposed that we could borrow against that money once it came time to actually pay [for the restaurant]. But that was a possible suggestion, and it hasn’t been acted on. So once we know exactly how much money it will cost to get into this, we’ll be able to have a few options about where to pull the funding from if we decide to go for it.”</p>\n<p>Following the Business Services’ decision, the Associated Students Legislative Council approved the loan as a resolution, said Tzankov. However, during an in-person interview Tzankov said that the Legislative Council members “don’t always go through the minutes.”</p>\n<p>Because the restaurant has the potential to generate revenue, A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs Cori Lantz said the proponents moved forward without configuring a final budget.</p>\n<p>“I have mentioned it was hard for groups to fund money [for the annex project], and the groups are getting something out of it,” Lantz said. “I’m not sure where the money [for the restaurant] is going to come from. I’m not sure how they’re going to pull it off.”</p>\n<p>However, Rodriguez said the restaurant is not necessarily guaranteed to generate a surplus.</p>\n<p>“It has been calculated that the first year we will be breaking even but every year after that would be going to paying back the loan,” Rodriguez said. “This business isn’t designed to profit necessarily, but it’s designed to provide a service for students.”</p>\n<p>Tzankov confirmed that a budget is still in the works.</p>\n<p>“The restaurant has a lot of potential to generate a stable source of revenue,” Tzankov said. “The projections in our most current business plan are highly dependent on what menu we decide to craft in the following months and therefore, no accurate estimate can be provided at this time; however, that information will be public as soon as it is finalized.”</p>\n<p>Proponents of the café are currently looking into other sources of funds.</p>\n<p>“We have applied to several grants, including an $80,000 grant from The Green Initiative Fund that will go towards the production of the cart and improvements on the building and are pursuing more options from foundations and nonprofits,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>According to the café supporters, excess funds from the restaurant may be recycled back to A.S. — but plans are still up in the air.</p>\n<p>“This coming year, [the A.S.] budget is looking a lot tighter than it has been in the past,” Elwood said. “There have been a few reasons for that, but the base reason is that the university is not covering our benefits anymore, which increased our yearly costs about $400,000. It’s a big jump that we’ve never had to deal with. I’d imagine that [money from the restaurant] could go to back to the general fund that we distribute evenly throughout the association, but I don’t think it’s really been discussed.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For the past few years, the restaurants at 6521 Pardall Rd. have not done well. On The Side was open for about six months before turning over to Dirty’s Barbeque and Brew Shack, which Tzankov estimated was open a mere two months.</p>\n<p>However, Gallardo said the previous establishments’ losses can be attributed mostly to poor management.</p>\n<p>“From information provided to us about the last couple businesses we can tell that they were somewhat successful,” Gallardo said. “They weren’t necessarily losing money; they just weren’t making a lot.  A lot of these businesses that showed up weren’t locally managed, they were usually setup by investors from L.A. or SF.”</p>\n<p>Gallardo also said A.S. plans to physically change the building to attract customers.</p>\n<p>“We would like to open up the space more, allow more natural lighting, larger lounge areas and expansion of the outdoor patio with added photovoltaic solar panels,” Gallardo said. “We hope to change the current image of a ‘haunted building’ — read that in the Nexus a few days ago — to a much more livelier hangout spot for students.”</p>\n<p>Proponents remain optimistic about the restaurant’s potential. According to Gallardo, the restaurant will provide healthier food options than the average Isla Vista restaurant.</p>\n<p>“We will put into place as many sustainable practices for our restaurant at its opening as possible, and continually upgrade our facilities to fit the mission of an environmentally conscious business,” Gallardo said in an e-mail. “We hope to create precedent for future businesses in Isla Vista in both their quality of food and how they do business.”</p>\n<p>Gallardo said the sustainable café will act as an educational resource and local dig for the community.</p>\n<p>“It will provide students with a space to come in and hangout, relax, read a book — kind of something along the lines of what the Hub is supposed to be, but with the intimacy it lacks,” Gallardo said.</p>\n<p>Because of the restaurant’s structure, it would function differently than other I.V. establishments, Elwood said.</p>\n<p>“First of all, the model that it’s being built on is so that eventually, if it were to be successful, it would exist to support itself,” Elwood said. “It wouldn’t be interested in making a profit, per se. Because of that, the food and services that came from the business would be much more fairly priced than other places in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Rodriguez also said the space could be used for community events such as lectures, concerts or open mic nights.</p>\n<p>All legal documents for the lease have been submitted to the office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang and are waiting approval of the Chancellor and possibly the Regents, said Gallardo.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately we have to clear a lot more hurdles than the average person trying to open up their own business,” Gallardo said.</p>\n<p>Despite controversy surrounding this endeavor, Gallardo said, he “wouldn’t want to tell any student to do anything [he] knew for a fact they didn’t want.”</p>\n<p>“At this point, it has been students telling us through surveys done by both Associated Students and the Student Food Collective that this is what they want,” Gallardo said. “They’re tired of hamburgers and burritos. If I encountered a student who was not happy with our decision to pursue a sustainable café and somehow had to convince him/her otherwise, I’d start by showing them the statistical information on food options in IV and the dissatisfaction students are having.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Associated Students’ Community Annex</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The A.S. EVPLA’s office has fought alongside partner groups to establish an annex in Isla Vista, but now their plans are hanging in the balance.</p>\n<p>EVPLA Cori Lantz said she hopes that the community center will be established in the 4,270 square foot area above the I.V. Medical Clinic at 570 Embarcadero del Mar. The annex would house 15 boards, commissions and committees — nine of which currently have no office space at all.</p>\n<p>“In order to get this entire thing up and running” Lantz said the building will cost $82,060 per year. Approximately $51,250 is allocated for rent, with the remainder funding utilities, supplies and staff and student salaries.</p>\n<p>“It sounds like a huge number,” Lantz said. “But it’s actually very reasonable.”</p>\n<p>C.A.B. allocated $24,000 for the space and the IVCRC has promised that they will contribute $2,000 every month to the annex rent upon establishment.</p>\n<p>However, the project still needs $34,560. Lantz asked the A.S. Financial Board for money, but was turned down.</p>\n<p>“For reasons I’m not sure of, they decided it was too much money,” Lantz said. “Which is frustrating because there are one-day events that cost just as much [as funding the building for an entire year].”</p>\n<p>Lantz is now asking groups with surplus funds for this year to contribute to the community center fund.</p>\n<p>According to Lantz, many of the 15 groups that hope to move into the annex may not be able to continue their work if this space is not provided.</p>\n<p>“It is nearly impossible for groups to expand and grow without an office,” Lantz said. “This is not a luxury at this point, this is a necessity.”</p>\n<p>The annex would also house a number of other community amenities including a computer lab, community garden, space for off-campus representatives to hold office hours, a recreation room and a kitchen where C.A.B. could cook breakfasts for the homeless.</p>\n<p>According to IVCRC Chair Megan Shumate, her group is one of the project’s biggest supporters.</p>\n<p>“I have been involved in making sure this project is made a priority because there are several committees in Associated Students that do not have a space, and it makes it extremely difficult to help the committee grow and achieve all of its goals to their full potential,” Shumate said in an e-mail. “IVCRC has been one of the biggest supporters of the I.V. Annex because it not only gives us a solid place to meet and have an office, but it also gives us a chance to reach out to our community members, especially those which aren’t students.”</p>\n<p>However, money is not the only problem the annex supporters face.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of work to do before we can make it a reality,” Elwood said. “I think that the idea of it is fantastic, but there have been a lot of hurdles getting there. Right now, it’s hard for me to say whether it will happen.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang recently mandated that A.S. needs to get approval from the UC Regents before signing any new lease in Isla Vista. Furthermore, Governor Brown’s current budget proposal calls for the dissolution of all Redevelopment Agencies in California. If this happens, the local Redevelopment Agency — which is responsible for the Isla Vista Master Plan and manages the annex property — may no longer exist.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are about 10 groups that allocate money from property taxes. Without the Redevelopment Agency, there would only be nine groups that, according to Lantz, are less savvy on fighting for Isla Vista improvements.</p>\n<p>“We would still be paying into property taxes, but getting nothing out of it,” Lantz said. “Any type of fiscal improvement [in Isla Vista] comes from the RDA.”</p>\n<p>Originally, A.S. planned to move into the building in the beginning of March. Now, Lantz says, the project cannot progress until sometime in early June after the next UC Regents meeting.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the tentative plans for the Anisq’ Oyo’ Master Plan redevelopment include expanding the park by tearing down a number of buildings including Rosarito, Naan Stop, the St. Athanasius Orthodox Church — and the space that Lantz hopes will be used for the annex.</p>\n<p>“I have had some reservations as we’ve moved forward,” EVPLA County Liaison and A.S. EVPLA candidate Tim Benson said in an e-mail. “I question the timing of the investment since the building is scheduled to be torn down within the next two years, and we face a likely chance of being kicked out of the building as soon as November.”</p>\n<p>Another question is whether the annex will be fully utilized by the students. According to Benson, A.S. does need to become more visible to the student population, but he is unsure of whether the annex would be the best option.</p>\n<p>“The genesis of putting an A.S. space in Isla Vista was the idea that a majority of UCSB students live in I.V. and a majority of their time is spent in I.V., so an annex in I.V. would be a great stride in making a more accessible and more visible association,” Benson said. “However, we could run into the same overarching issue of student apathy. We shouldn’t fund a large project if students won’t utilize it. I question how visible the building will be as it is tucked behind a row of businesses.”</p>\n<p>Despite the setbacks, Lantz said she and others would continue supporting the project.</p>\n<p>“We are still moving forward,” Lantz said. “We are looking into alternative spaces, but none would be as good. We’re going to continue fighting for that space.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36225\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36225\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/","id":3580,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3579,3578,3577],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"This Week in UC News 1/9 – 1/16","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2020-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uc-news.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uc-news.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Showcasing the top stories of the week from other UC student newspapers","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interested in keeping up with what’s happening across the UC system?

Newsom Announces Proposed 2020-21 Budget (<em><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/01/14/ca-gov-newsom-announces-proposed-state-budget/\">Daily Californian</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget includes $36 billion for higher education, including community colleges, CSUs and the UC system. This is a $110 million increase compared to last year and specifically increases the UC General Fund by $217 million. The budget also includes $84 billion for K-12 schools and $750 million for a new state fund. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz: Continued Striking at UC Santa Cruz (<em><a href=\"https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/01/10/skilled-craft-workers-launch-indefinite-strike/\">City on a Hill Press</a></em>) </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Wednesday, the UC Santa Cruz American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) K7 workers were on their ninth day of striking; they announced earlier this month that striking would continue until the university presented them a contract that delivers “liveable standards.” K7 includes over 50 employees on the UCSC campus, such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters and HVAC mechanics. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCLA: UCLA Rejects Proposal for Students Experiencing Homelessness (<em><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/15/ucla-rejects-parking-space-proposal-for-students-experiencing-homelessness/\">Daily Bruin</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA rejected a proposal from the North Westwood Neighborhood Council and the Undergraduate Students Association Council, calling it “unsanitary” for students to sleep in their cars on campus. Instead, the administration suggested a “hostel-like” environment where students pay $15 per night. A small-scale version of the hostel program would include 100 beds and could potentially begin as soon as Fall Quarter 2020. The councils also called on UCLA administration to collect more data on students experiencing homelessness. Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck said in the meeting that it is difficult to identify students facing homelessness versus housing insecurity. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine: Irvine’s Housing Crisis (<em><a href=\"https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/01/13/irvines-housing-crisis-how-housing-insecurity-is-affecting-both-students-and-residents-in-irvine/\">New University</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New University looked back on housing trends over 2019, where increasing prices have led to lower home sales and greater housing insecurity for students and low-income people. These trends are coupled with lack of homeless resources, as earlier this year Irvine (along with four other Orange County cities) was sued for mistreatment of homeless people and lack of shelters in the city. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/upcoming-year-will-be-uc-president-napolitanos-last-in-office/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announcement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that she will be stepping down from her position on Aug. 1, 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion was held at UC Los Angeles, with students, faculty and UC system stakeholders sharing their advice, ideas and hopes for the type of president they would like to see next. Comments were directed to the </span><a href=\"https://presidentialsearch.universityofcalifornia.edu/special-committee.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special Committee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a temporary group appointed by the chair of the Board of Regents to consider and ultimately recommend a candidate for the position in question.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ernesto Arciniega, a PhD student at UCLA, was first to speak. He articulated a desire for a president who, instead of admitting diverse students with the sole aim of fulfilling diversity quotas, “has a larger social consciousness, who truly commits to defend the voice of the voiceless,” a message that many other speakers echoed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 12 other student and faculty speakers at the public forum discussed college affordability, increasing mental health resources and addressing the climate crisis, but one of the most consistent demands raised by speakers that afternoon centered around electing a president who would resolve the contract dispute with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees 3299 (AFSCME) in the workers’ favor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME, one of the UC’s largest unions, has regularly gone on strike in the past few years over </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/afscme-calls-for-boycott-of-commencement-speakers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pay raises</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-06/afscme-files-six-new-unfair-labor-practice-complaints-against-uc-plans-to-strike-nov-13/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">minimum wage and outsourcing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Under Janet [Napolitano]’s leadership, the UC has refused to provide the workers of AFSCME 3299 with a fair contract,” said Alexia Hatun, an undergraduate at UCLA. Hatun said she would like to see a UC president “who will respect the dignity of labor and that will end outsourcing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Michelle, a third-year labor studies major at UCLA, agreed with Hatun. Explaining that her friend, a residence hall housekeeper, works seven days a week and two other jobs in order to make a living, Michelle told the committee that she believes her friend is “employed by an entity that devalues her work.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is unacceptable and the UC should strive for better,” Michelle said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple speakers also emphasized that the new president should clearly indicate that the UC system will protect any undocumented students enrolled in the UC system from deportation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other stakeholders, like representatives from education organizations, K–12 teachers and UC alumni, spoke after students and faculty. Unlike the speakers before, stakeholders generally avoided direct criticism of Napolitano. Darlene V. Willis, co-founder of the Concerned Parents Alliance, was mostly alone in acknowledging that the next president will need to “help restore public trust and confidence in higher education institutions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, stakeholders suggested a more varied set of issues they would like the new UC president to tackle, though they did agree on a few common topics. One such topic was the need for increased collaboration between different educational systems in the state — as far back as pre-kindergarten — and with community colleges and the California State University system, according to speaker Carlos Iola.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s way more to be gained than lost through planned and purposeful partnerships,” said Anne Stanton of the Linked Learning Alliance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers mentioned that the transfer process in particular could be improved by such partnerships with community colleges, according to Darla Cooper, executive director of the Research and Planning Group, which focuses on increasing the success of California community colleges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooper said that prospective transfers “need a more holistic and integrated approach to ensure that they reach their ultimate goal of a bachelor’s degree and a better life for themselves and their families.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as applications to the UC system have continually surged, space is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the UC system, which Rachel Bonkovsky from the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools criticized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since 1980, we’ve built 23 prisons in the state, and we’ve opened the doors to one UC,” Bonkovsky said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next town hall will take place at UC Riverside on Jan. 16.
