That good job will set you up for financial success, and you’ll live comfortably.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85379\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85379\" data-attachment-id=\"85379\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-12/pursue-your-passions-or-please-your-parents/sanya-article-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanya-article-art-e1544664472152.jpg?fit=650%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanya-article-art-e1544664472152.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanya-article-art-e1544664472152.jpg?fit=650%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85379\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanya-article-art-e1544664472152.jpg?resize=650%2C650\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"650\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85379\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand where they’re coming from. It’s the way they were told they would find success. It’s what my parents did. They studied hard, went to a good college and, when they had the opportunity, they moved to the United States to make a better life for themselves. And when they were able to support themselves and my brother and me, they started sending money back to India to support their family back home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve been lucky enough to be able to visit India frequently, and over the years, I’ve seen how my parents have been able to give back to their parents and siblings there. On my dad’s side of the family, his mother, sister, brother-in-law and three nephews and nieces were able to move out of a one-bedroom apartment with his help. Two of my cousins have now moved to the U.S. to get their master’s degree, with his help. My mom was able to help her sister build her own hospital in Hyderabad and help her brother-in-law run for office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I frequently joke about how Indian people only view three careers as options for their children: doctor, lawyer and engineer. But it really was the case. I fought hard and got into truly nasty arguments with my parents growing up about what career path I would pursue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always been a writer at heart. I knew that. So when it came time to apply to colleges, every day in my home was a battlefield. Eventually, my parents and I settled on a compromise: I would go into marketing, the one field my parents thought was financially viable and that I thought I could do work that I was good at and enjoyed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I decided on UCSB as my school, my parents were skeptical of communication as my major but figured it was the closest thing the school had to business. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then I fell in love with journalism. I had already taken a few years of it in high school (another source of strain between my parents and me), but it was at the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where I knew there wasn’t anything else I wanted to do with my life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’LL BE WRITING DAMN ARTICLES ON MY DEATHBED,” I wrote in an overzealous finsta post over the summer.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Didn’t my mom understand how hard it was to navigate a system that no one gave me a guide for?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know I have a long road ahead of me when it comes to my parents. A few months ago, my parents told me to cut back on my time at the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because it was just a “hobby.” I didn’t know how to tell them how it was so much more to me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we’re getting there, though. The other day, I talked to my mom about the internships I had applied to and about a journalism class I was thinking about taking. And for the first time in my life, my mom talked to me about it like journalism was an option. For the first time in my life, my mom was accepting me as I was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be people who read this and won’t understand why it matters so much what my parents say. But despite how hard I’ve railed against a lot of the things my parents believe in, there’s a part of me that still wants to please them. I want my parents to be proud of me. I want to show them that I can both pursue the career I love and support myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And above all that, there’s the prevailing aspiration familiar to any child of an immigrant: I want to make their sacrifices worthwhile. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are days when I get so angry at my parents for not understanding me and at the world for throwing me all the curveballs it can think of. And then there are days when I Whatsapp message my parents about something I’ve accomplished, and they’ll respond with a thumbs-up or “nice” (the only two ways they know how to give praise), and it means everything to me.</span></p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi wants people to find a balance between their parents’ aspirations and their own. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

It’s common knowledge that you should slow roast your chicken breast for more than five whole minutes or that ground beef that’s been in the fridge for the last week and a half is ground zero for an E. coli outbreak. Before I moved in last week, I never thought my life would be endangered by a half-cooked dead animal. Unfortunately, my housemates perfectly demonstrate the distinction between having a brain and using it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One evening, I come home tired, cold and hungry and find that my roommate has been cooking, and he’s saved some for me!</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here’s a chicken leg and rice,” he says. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why thank you,” I respond: And, in a moment of weakness, I almost take a bite — before I remember that this is the same chicken I saw several centuries ago festering away on the countertop, sitting in its own private lake of bloody water. Now, if my housemates want to contract salmonella on a daily basis they’re more than welcome to do so. But when they make such a vile and heinous attempt on my life by feeding me undercooked and over-defrosted chicken, things have gone one bloody hunk of meat too far. After this traumatic incident I seriously wondered why no one in the house wanted my sound advice on how not to intentionally ingest health-endangering compounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I decided the best course of action would be to methodically and scientifically determine what made my housemates the brilliant idiots they are. After a week of observations, several assorted nonviolent confrontations, a few major squabbles and the odd barely averted tragedy or two, I came to the conclusion that the only things any of my housemates really have in common is that they are Asian men. Now, being the brilliant scientist that I am, I deduced that since all five of us are Asian and male — and all of us are idiots — being Asian and male must be contributing to this idiocy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes sense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See, the main problem for us Asians in admitting error is that, traditionally, a single mistake is enough to disgrace your family for the next eon or two. The contrary is also true: Every Asian family has at least one deity-ancestor who lived when dinosaurs were the primary mode of transportation. Despite having lived so long ago, we know today as a scientific certainty that this particular ancestor was half-dragon, half-tiger and held off 346 invading Huns on his own — not to mention that he was the chief counselor of the Chinese emperor and commander of the imperial fleet and army at the same time. As such, any ancestor of lesser import is quickly forgotten by the annals of time, ostensibly because no one wants to hear the epic saga of Uncle Li who moved to America against his family’s wishes, caused irreparable harm to the family name and opened a chow mein stand in Brooklyn. In the same vein, no Asian wants to be forever remembered as that one disgrace to the family by getting straight A’s and a Ph.D. but not even being able to cook. Admission of error — never. Error in itself is a disgrace to the family name. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a week of observations, several assorted nonviolent confrontations, a few major squabbles and the odd barely averted tragedy or two, I came to the conclusion that the only things any of my housemates really have in common is that they are Asian men.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asking for help has more practical repercussions as well: The problem with asking a family member for help in an Asian circle is that, at most, within the next three to five business days, everyone you have ever met in your life, along with all their friends, coworkers and deceased aunt’s stepfather’s rottweilers, will know all about how Ling Ling tried to make miso soup in a frying pan. You will never redeem yourself and you will never catch a break. Every time someone so much as takes out a frying pan, aunt whatever-her-name-was will take it as a mandate to recount the events of Ling Ling’s frying pan miso soup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is even more true for Asian males. As the head of the traditional Asian household, us males are expected to be entirely correct all the time. Facts to the contrary? Invented by insubordinate and disrespectful outcasts who have no respect for true family. Good advice? It’s no good if I don’t agree with it. Three minutes too short to grill a side of pork? Nonsense! I’ll eat it myself just to prove how safe it is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One superb example can be seen on bike paths where one particularly dashing and adventuresome international student will courageously lead the way onto the path by foot, presumably demonstrating to others in his posse how healthful and efficient such a practice can be. Then, upon his narrowly avoiding permanent brain damage by bike, it takes a good 15 minutes of shouting to dislodge our explorer from his notion that bike paths were intended to be traversed on foot. Much annoyance could be prevented through the use of eyes and common sense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an Asian male myself, I have to admit that I share some of these tendencies. I can’t remember a single time growing up that I was ever wrong or mistaken. No, not the time I was five and thought that yellowish stuff in a brown bottle was apple juice. No, not after I got roaring drunk on it and replaced all the holes in Mr. Potato Head with crayons. Especially not after my parents whooped my ass for drinking beer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s get real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, your parents will not disown you because you couldn’t self-study Chemistry 1A. No, your teachers won’t roast you for coming in during office hours. Yes, there may be slight discomfort upon admitting you need help in chemistry, or that you’ve never cooked chicken, or your obituary nearly listed death by cyclist. But take it from someone who’s had food poisoning — that slight discomfort is still way better than the alternative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So to all the guys out there: You have two heads, the big one and the small one. The small one isn’t nearly as big as you think it is, so do yourself a favor and use the big one instead. Don’t be afraid to admit you’re wrong because one head of the household is enough. Cram five heads into one tight apartment in Isla Vista and you have a literal sausage fest. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sam Suh recommends that, in the event of a sausage fest, fry them for at least six to eight minutes.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3aaf97bc258d988925a37f572ab1cf95?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3aaf97bc258d988925a37f572ab1cf95?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/samsuh/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Suh</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Suh is an opinion staff writer.

Two-way, double-edged assimilation! Cultural exchange and such things!</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When forming a judgement on specific acts of appropriation, one seeks the answer to the following questions: Is it performed by a collective or an individual? Is it an act of control or horizontal cultural exchange? Is it an instantiation of a colonialist attitude or merely the product of benign ignorance? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The confusion surrounding the debate on cultural appropriation reflects the ambiguity inherent in these questions.These are important and legitimate questions to be answered by some visionary or sentient Twitter account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But more interesting than the actual objects of the debate is the nature of the debate itself — especially pertaining to the appropriation of “foreign” cultures. These discussions fixate on the most visible markers of culture, and they are disproportionately driven by second- and third-generation migrants, as opposed to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">literal </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">migrants and people who are native to the culture in question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to condemn or delegitimize their position. Due to their familiarity with the appropriated culture and understanding of the appropriating culture, achieved through lifelong inspection and maybe imitation or repudiation, it is often easier for this group to recognize patterns of appropriation. It’s easier for them to view the individual appropriator in the context of a broader tradition of collective requisition, of institutionalized theft, that essentializes and establishes authority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is another factor underlying second-generation migrants’ passion for the cultural appropriation debate. Growing up in a place that is vastly different from where their parents or grandparents were socialized makes their relationship with their ancestral culture strained and remote. Familiarity often seems like the absolute limit of their interaction with their ancestral culture, simply due to the people they are surrounded by. In certain cases, “involvement” or “engagement” might be more appropriate terms. In any case, these are placeholders for actually </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">living </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in a culture. The cultural appropriation debate consolingly and perhaps falsely provides </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/29/cultural-appropriation-racial-oppression-exploitation-colonialism\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the possibility of an authentic, secure relationship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with one’s ancestral culture. It offers a means of defending it, and therefore possessing and belonging to it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the majority of those of us born to migrant parents, our ancestral cultures have always retained some degree of distance </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">geographically, personally and spiritually</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but are nevertheless crucial to how others perceive us. These include our parents, our relatives and peers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the white people who will always see us as foreign because we are not seen as white. And if it feels like you might never fully belong in America, where you have grown up, the natural place of refuge seems to be the place you have involuntarily left behind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in the country that is foreign to you but not your parents, it occasionally seems as if you are only a sightseer, a privileged wanderer. It might seem like you are not essentially different from the white tourists, the Westerners from whom you have temporarily fled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On my otherwise joyful summer escapades to India and Sri Lanka, this remains a constant and terrible fear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the reason I love these biennial trips so much is that I get to spend a full month surrounded by people who look like me </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who share my skin, my arms, my bones. I allow myself to stare at these dark brown faces, at the dark brown eyes fenced within, and imagine them as mirrors. I’m aware that my intense concentration on these people is rooted in a precarious delusion. As soon as I open my mouth they will recognize me as American, as someone who is different.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When white people also involve themselves with these symbols, it can be distressing for descendants of migrants because they are a reminder of the truth: that they come from neither here nor there. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also recognize that I’m so desperate for a sense of belonging with these strangers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to feel like I originated from them or from the culture that binds them and my family together </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because it is clear that I did not originate entirely from America and certainly not from Americans, if these are indeed different things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ancestral culture exerts an intense gravitational pull and yet constantly drifts away. It is hidden by faces that are endlessly inscrutable and yet uncannily similar to mine. The language of cultural appropriation, a language of emotional violence and of theft, implies an unambiguous, rightful possession of this culture. This is acutely comforting; it is why cultural appropriation is the means by which descendants of migrants prefer to challenge the dynamics and parallels of colonization and dominance in Western societies. Guarding one’s ancestral culture and expressing resentment toward the trespasser is a method of coping with the unique, universal alienation experienced by those born into</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a foreign country to foreigner parents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also something to be said about how the debate revolves around only the most visible markers of culture: clothing, accessories, food and artistic expression. Perhaps this is the limit to which those driving the debate are capable of relating to their ancestral cultures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Migrant parents often try to socialize their children into their home cultures. Their intention might be to lessen their struggle to relate to their children and vice versa; to handle the distance from their own upbringing; or maybe to create a new home in this foreign land. I don’t think any of this is necessarily wrong or harmful, but when the children of migrants are surrounded by peers and teachers who do not share their parents’ culture, as they essentially always are, their ancestral acculturation exists only on a symbolic level. The idea is that if one volunteers dutifully at the temple, learns to cook the national food and wears the traditional clothes while dancing the traditional dance, they will be the authentic Something that their parents and their grandparents and their great-aunts were, or still are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, this is not true. But perhaps it is something that migrants and their children need to believe. Because of the logistical difficulties involved in transporting all of the people who produce this culture to a new land, we have settled for importing their clothes, their dances and their food. These are things that can easily be transplanted halfway across the globe into an entirely new context, and still retain their beauty, if not their original meaning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For migrants, these cultural markers trigger nostalgia, the memory of a different world. For their children, they allow refuge from the ambiguity inherent in their identity. In performing these acts of tradition and cultural symbolism, they construct an ideal model of a migrant that cleanly separates what is American about them from what is, say, “Oriental” about them. They are allowed to believe that they are both things at once, rather than neither.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So when white people also involve themselves with these symbols, it can be distressing for descendants of migrants because they are a reminder of the truth: that they come from neither here nor there. They do not belong </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because the white people, to whom this place purportedly belongs, have proven repeatedly that they would prefer to take the clothes and discard the person. The symbolism that is so fraught with meaning for second- and third-generation migrant identity is a vehicle for the appropriator’s voyeurism.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does my brownness alone absolve me of this superficial, negligent cultural-sightseeing?</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This voyeurism serves as a mirror, however grotesque and warped, of the falsehood inherent in this unambiguous identity. It is a reminder that the way in which white people relate to your ancestors’ culture is not fundamentally different from the way you do. Their appropriation is really an exaggeration, an unintentional but mocking caricature of the way you have been forced to understand yourself. In this sense, the disgust toward cultural appropriation reflects a discomfort with one’s own identity that, in addition to being subjected to racism, is further muddled by ancestral migration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get me wrong: I enjoy trashing white people just as much as the next left-wing curmudgeon. But I also think it would be a valuable exercise for those of us who (maybe justifiably) seek solace in the cultural appropriation debate to consider what the concept really means, where it stems from and to where it should extend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does it mean, for instance, that I keep a little statue of Vinayagar in my room next to my secular and absurdist monkey sculptures? What does it mean that I hang a Hindu calendar on my dorm wall despite the fact that I don’t believe in any of these gods? Despite the fact that I don’t know or care about any of the special days carefully mapped out on the calendar — this day is good for vegetarianism, that one for marriage, yesterday for especially frenzied praying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know which gods are which and why, but I like to go to temples, eat the food and look at the bright colors, the stone-gray statues, and the brown people. I would be irritated if a white person did this sort of thing. Does my brownness alone absolve me of this superficial, negligent cultural-sightseeing? Why do I have to intentionally explore these elements of a culture that I would instinctively call “mine”?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why are Asian-Americans allowed to be so enthusiastic about creating artistic fusions between “Oriental” and “Western” cultures, when this runs the risk of essentialism and misrepresentation? What about </span><a href=\"http://muse.jhu.edu/article/14606\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the co-adoption of hip hop culture by Asian Americans</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?

The reason I care at all about this thread is that my grandmother tied it for me. I asked her to, impulsively, and as she tied it she muttered things, about my future, my education </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> words of faith and terror </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that I did not have the cultural context to understand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m often afraid that I lack the cultural context to understand her, even. Her routines, her habits and her rituals are more perplexing to me than seems proper. There are so many things that are available to me that could help me understand her: my mother as a human intermediary, Tamil as a communicative medium, the periodic month-long visits, the food that she is perpetually preparing in the kitchen that is solely her territory.  I know just about everything reasonable there is to know </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> besides consistent proximity to her and the world she occupies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the question that I am really dancing around: What do I think about Selena Gomez wearing a bindi? I think it says something about how we relate cultural symbolism to gender. Women are most often accused of appropriation and appropriated objects most often belong to other women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cultural appropriation debate may not yield answers. It may only serve to illuminate the nature of the lies that govern them. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raveen Sivashanker is perplexed by fruits and vegetables with white interiors and exteriors of color.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88827\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/what-cultural-appropriation-means-to-second-generation-migrants/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88827\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/what-cultural-appropriation-means-to-second-generation-migrants/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/what-cultural-appropriation-means-to-second-generation-migrants/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/what-cultural-appropriation-means-to-second-generation-migrants/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/what-cultural-appropriation-means-to-second-generation-migrants/","id":5642,"author":{"id":821,"name":"Raveen Sivashanker"},"related":[5641,5640,5639],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Perfect But Passive: The Problem With the ‘Model Minority’","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Hyphenated American","publish_date":"2019-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dnasian-01.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dnasian-01.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Annabel Li breaks down the myth of the model minority.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you grew up in a Chinese household, chances are that you have been praised with the word “guai” whenever you did something pleasing to your parents.

Affirmative action was first introduced by JFK as a way to get minorities more involved in certain industries and fields; this then evolved into a system of racial quotas in the college admission system. </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/how-lewis-powell-changed-affirmative-action/572938/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1978, UC Davis Medical School was sued</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by a young white applicant Allan Bakke when he was informally told that he was rejected due to minority quotas they had to fulfill. The case made it to the Supreme Court, and he was eventually admitted but not without </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the ruling that although </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/how-lewis-powell-changed-affirmative-action/572938/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quotas were unconstitutional</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, affirmative action was constitutional</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> under some circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, this same issue has come up with Harvard, but with Asian-American applicants as the plaintiff. Harvard evaluates applicants categorically, rating them in areas like athletics, academics and extracurriculars. Now facing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a lawsuit for systematically rejecting Asian applicants,</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/harvard-asian-enrollment-applicants.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Harvard admissions was found to be consistently marking Asian applicants down</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the personality category when other areas had high marks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, standing on the beach, listening to the gentle, informed, politically correct voices of these hosts casually attribute Asians to “pawns” was surreal. The possibility of young Asian-Americans feeling genuinely opposed to systematic discrimination against them by a reputable institution like Harvard was so unfathomable, that instead, mental calculus had to be done to come to the more appropriate conclusion. Whites are the real people opposing this issue, and Asians are the “pawns,” removing that pesky outlier that is our demographic, and reconciling minority-friendly social liberalism with the support of affirmative action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pawns” may be the more comfortable description, because it’s an absurd thought isn’t it? A politically involved Asian-American. The concept of the Asian is not one who is engaged, active or powerful. We’re mice. We’re “guai.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps sitting in the adornments of the default, at a clinical distance, it becomes easy to gesture vaguely toward other pigments and say “minorities.” This may make it feel rational to hold all pigments to the standard — the best tool in a person’s arsenal if they’re trying to throw a wrench into the idea that groups like African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans carry any sort of inherent disadvantage with them.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like a secret weapon, my voiceless pigment is invoked as an example — the attractive numbers, test scores, median income, divorce rate, the immaculate success that refutes the necessity of any person of color to file a complaint.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like a secret weapon, my voiceless pigment is invoked as an example — the attractive numbers, test scores, median income, divorce rate, the immaculate success that refutes the necessity of any person of color to file a complaint. The monetary figures that become a red herring in discussions about white privilege; if white people are privileged, then why do Asians make more?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The things said about Asian-Americans in the media come from anyone but. And part of me feels like we brought it upon ourselves, by being okay with the stereotyping, it is mostly positive after all — what’s to complain about?  We’re doing relatively well in the U.S., so why get into the messiness of politics? We may even take pride in how little we complain, how little we speak up. Maybe that’s why our voter turnout rate is </span><a href=\"https://psmag.com/news/low-voter-turnout-among-asian-americans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">47 percent versus 66 percent from blacks and 64 percent from whites.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At the same time, there is a chicken-egg situation: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only</span><a href=\"https://psmag.com/news/low-voter-turnout-among-asian-americans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 31 percent of Asian-Americans </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can report being contacted by candidates versus the 53 percent average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stereotypes aren’t evil, they’re the unfortunate products of pattern recognition. It feels logical to paint a mental picture of a white man carrying a yellow face when you hear that Ed Blum is suing on behalf of Asians. Perhaps, sitting in an admissions office, looking at so many qualified Asian applicants, it may feel necessary, even rational, to justify rejection with the prejudice that Asians have no personality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going about student life here at UCSB, I’m shocked to see so many Asian students who aren’t aware of what’s happening to their own community. So many motivated, intelligent and creative individuals who have not had any discussions of the trade-offs present in policies that consider race, or lack of representation in media or never knew the history of the Chinese Exclusion Act or Japanese internment camps. The period of dormancy is over. It’s time to become more aware and, if need be, angry.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annabel Li thinks the perception of Asian Americans as a passive minority needs to change.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/998854f3488f339f5348c550901aa13e?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/998854f3488f339f5348c550901aa13e?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/annabel-li/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Annabel Li</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Annabel Li is a first-year math major who has an active interest in finance.
