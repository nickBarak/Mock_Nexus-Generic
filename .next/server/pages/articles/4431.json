The Gauchos will have to win their six remaining games to do so.</p>\n<p>Already in desperation mode entering the game, Head Coach Andrew Checketts opted for a pitching change in the first inning after sophomore starting pitcher Domenic Mazza gave up UCSB’s 2-0 lead on a RBI groundout and a homerun.</p>\n<p>Sophomore designated hitter/relief pitcher Greg Mahle came in to stop the bleeding, but not before he ran into trouble in the fourth inning.</p>\n<p>With UCSB down by a run, Mahle allowed the runner on second base to score on a double down the left field line, forcing Checketts to make another pitching change.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine began separating itself from there on despite sophomore closer Dillon Tate taking over on the mound. The right-hander salvaged the inning by allowing only one more batter to cross the plate on a wild pitch. However, Pepperdine extended its lead to 6-2.</p>\n<p>The game got even uglier for the Gauchos after that. After the Waves managed only one run on a bases-loaded situation in the fifth inning, they broke the game completely open in the next three innings.</p>\n<p>Senior relief pitcher Cameron Cuneo took over in the sixth and loaded the bases with one out. Cuneo then walked the next batter before Checketts made another call to the pen.</p>\n<p>The move did not pay off as the next batter also walked with the bases loaded. In total, the Waves earned two runs on only one hit in that inning.</p>\n<p>While UCSB attempted to find the right combination on the mound, the Waves’ sophomore starting pitcher Jackson McClelland was in complete control of his game.</p>\n<p>Through six innings of work, McClelland allowed only two runs on five hits, striking out seven batters and walking only two to improve his record to 7-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put an end to its scoring drought in the top half of the seventh with a three-run inning.</p>\n<p>Sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic had an infield single with the bases loaded and two outs to earn the first run and junior right fielder Cameron Newell hit a two-run single to tack on more runs for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine put a stamp to the game in the bottom half of the inning with a two-run homerun that pushed its run total into the double-digit range. With one more run in the eighth, the Waves finished the game with a total of 12 runs.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did have standout performances from two of its players. Junior shortstop Peter Maris hit 2-5 and Nesovic went 2-4 from the plate and one of three Gauchos to earn at least one RBI in the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays again this weekend against San Francisco in a non-conference series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 14, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55296\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55296\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/","id":4431,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4430,4429,4428],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Measure O Passes, Will Fund I.V.

Santa Barbara began the year with its second-best start in program history at 18-3 and ranked as high as No. 10. Since then, however, UCSB has been in a tail-spin, losing four of six conference series.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos reached their low point of the season last weekend when they were swept by first-place UC Irvine in a series critical for Big West positioning. Before Tuesday’s win at Bakersfield, UCSB was held from winning its previous four games, the longest stretch the team had gone without winning this season.</p>\n<p>A big reason for UCSB’s struggles has been a lack of quality innings from its starting pitching. Against the Anteaters, Santa Barbara starting pitching combined to allow 12 runs in 12.1 innings of work, while the bullpen gave up a total of five runs in 10.5 innings of relief.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Gauchos’ relief pitching has been the most consistent facet of this year’s team. Despite giving up a late lead to UCI last weekend in the second game of the series, the bullpen had previously pitched the Gauchos into having a 20-0 record when leading after the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>The duo of sophomore relief pitchers Greg Mahle and Dillon Tate have provided a solid tandem in the back end of the bullpen for UCSB. Besides their reliability, the two have been workhorses for the team. Mahle ranks first in conference appearances by a pitcher with 13 and is coming off his longest outing where he pitched six shutout innings of two-hit ball in the series finale against Irvine.</p>\n<p>Mahle’s standout year has taken a backseat to Tate’s own outstanding season. Tate is second behind Mahle in conference appearances by a pitcher with 11 and after pitching three scoreless innings against Bakersfield, he lowered his ERA to 0.55. The shutdown closer has allowed just one earned run in 21 of his 22 outings this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also need to put more runs on the board against a team that ranks second to last in the conference in ERA at 3.64. Recently, junior shortstop Peter Maris has been the best hitter for the Gauchos. In his last eight games he has hit .362, including collecting three hits and two RBI against CSUB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has done significantly better at home than on the road and will look to take advantage of the Matadors’ troubles away from home. CSUN is 5-17 on the road.</p>\n<p>Aside from home field advantage, the team will also honor four of its seniors for Senior Day, including starting catcher Jackson Morrow and left fielder Joey Epperson, who leads the team with a .384 batting average.</p>\n<p>First game of the series is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 8, 2014’s print edition of  </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55217\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55217\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/","id":4430,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4429,4428,4427],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
