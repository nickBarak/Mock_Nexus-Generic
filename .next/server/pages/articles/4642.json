At Saturday’s launch event, participants shared ideas and recommendations for the community center’s role and services. The center is set to be complete spring 2017.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, I.V. residents are “extremely enthusiastic” about the project.</p>\n<p>“They have formed committees to work on different aspects of it,” Farr said. “We are certainly encouraging their participation and input into all faces of it. My mantra has just been that we really want to keep the project moving forward and as on budget and on time as possible.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs Paola Dela Cruz said the community center launched after decades of inactivity due to support from the county.</p>\n<p>“I think [the community center] has to do with the opportunity that the county has given us to actually own — for the community to own — this building,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said another reason for the project’s increased momentum is a community response to challenges I.V. has recently faced.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, I think it also has to do with other events that have happened in our community which have raised awareness about the issues that we have here,” Dela Cruz said. “We do need county resources, we do need the university to invest money, we do need residents to take ownership.”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Sue Whisenand said she hopes I.V. residents of all ages and backgrounds use the community center for a variety of purposes.</p>\n<p>“For me, I see it being multigenerational,” Whisenand said. “I see it being a place where we have food events that help with building good nutrition and eating habits, and I see places where we can have different shows, and I see a pleasant place where maybe there are some parenting classes.”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Bonnie Murdock also said she wants the center to serve all I.V. communities.</p>\n<p>“I envision it as a location for flexible activities where various groups can request use of the building, and I hope it is used for residents, students and all age groups,” Murdock said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she was happy to see people come together to celebrate the project’s launch and show interest in its progress.</p>\n<p>“I’m so glad to see that throughout this process different communities have been able to come together and to talk,” Dela Cruz said. “At the beginning I think it is difficult because we all have different ideas and perspectives … but it’s nice to just see, look at this, we did it together.”</p><div

She says she was motivated to retire so she could spend more time with family.</em> Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr announced Friday she will not seek a third term after December 2016.</p>\n<p>Farr has served on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors since 2009, representing Santa Ynez, Goleta and Isla Vista. While in office, Farr secured $480,000 of county funding for an I.V. Community Center and $10.3 million for the Pescadero Lofts, which provide housing and services for I.V.’s houseless population. Farr has also supported Assemblymember Das Williams’ recently signed Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), which will create Community Services District (CSD) in I.V. if approved by residents.</p>\n<p>Farr said she decided to end her time in office because she is feeling “the pull of family.”</p>\n<p>“My sister passed away in the spring. She was my only sibling. She was four years younger than I was. That was a real blow and continues to be a real blow,” Farr said. “My mother — now I’m the only child she has and she’s 88 years old, and also since I’ve been in office, I’ve had two grandchildren born.”</p>\n<p>Farr said she originally ran for office in 2008 because colleagues told her she was apt for the position.</p>\n<p>“I got to thinking about it, and I thought, well, maybe I do have a unique background … I obviously didn’t know whether I’d be elected or not,” Farr said. “I’d never run for any public office before, and so that was quite an experience.”</p>\n<p>Farr said her career began when she presented a proposal to the Board of Supervisors to build sidewalks and stop signs in the then unincorporated area of Goleta. According to Farr, she then led two different neighborhood community groups, one in Goleta and one later in the Santa Ynez Valley. She then became Second District Planning Commissioner of Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“The fact that I’ve lived in the county for almost four decades now, first in the south coast and now in the Santa Ynez Valley, kind of gave me a unique background,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Farr says one of her “legacies to the district” will be securing funding to open the I.V. Community Center.</p>\n<p>“That’s certainly a project that is personally close to my heart, and I’m glad that we were able to keep going and secure the funding,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Williams said Farr’s support for AB 3 in her role as Chair of Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), a state-mandated agency that typically oversees the development of CSDs, was essential to the development and progress of the bill.</p>\n<p>“She came to Sacramento to testify during our first committee hearing and was able to effectively attest to the real challenges of Isla Vista in their quest for self-governance,” Williams said in an email. “Also, as chair of LAFCO during this process, Supervisor Farr has been a voice of reason, encouraging a compromise where LAFCO could be involved in the formation of the CSD while understanding why the community wouldn’t want to leave it totally in their hands.”</p>\n<p>Fifth District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino, who has worked with Farr since she assumed office, said Farr is a “consummate professional.”</p>\n<p>“She’s always extremely well-prepared, and she and I don’t agree on everything, but I’ve always respected her positions. She’s always had a very well-thought-out position, and I’m really going to miss working with her,” Lavagnino said. “I haven’t heard of anybody who’s talking about running, but it is absolutely the most difficult district in the five to represent … she’s got a very difficult job and I think she’s done extremely well.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of External Affairs Paola Dela Cruz said she has worked with Farr on a number of projects, including the recent appointment of Community Resource Deputy James McKarrell.</p>\n<p>“Doreen Farr managed to get funding for our community service deputy — [I believe] that was $114,000,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>According to Lavagnino, Farr’s work in support of AB 3 will not come to fruition without sufficient funding for a CSD.</p>\n<p>“I totally support self-governance for Isla Vista,” Lavagnino said. “The problem is if you don’t have a funding stream to handle that — I don’t think that the students understand exactly how much it costs to provide sidewalks and those kinds of things that supervisor Farr’s been working diligently on for the last years.”</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she appreciates that Farr has made significant contributions to I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am really proud and honored to have been able to work with her, and I think all of our community is thankful for the amount of work she’s put into Isla Vista, the amount of money that she’s been able to get for our community,” Dela Cruz said. “The last thing I’d like to say to her is just thank you, thank you for your hard work.”</p>\n<p>Farr said her career has been rewarding, but she is grateful for the opportunity she now has to spend time with her family.</p>\n<p>“When you get into your 60s and your friends are starting to retire and you just start thinking that there are other things that are important to do,” Farr said. “Being the Third District County Supervisor is absolutely an incredible job [and] opportunity — it’s an honor and a privilege every day to have been chosen by the voters to do this very important work that shapes county policy, [and] shapes land use.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 10 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate meeting on Wednesday night to give witness testimonials of the events leading up to the death of second-year pre-biology major Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez on Sunday, Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4:40 a.m., two Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies responded to reports of a male subject on the 6700 block of Abrego Road running in the street screaming for help. Upon arrival, deputies were flagged down by a nearby witness who stated the male subject, later identified as UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez, had a deep laceration on his right arm.</p>\n<p>The five students, Areli Ariana, Ashley Baker, Jocelin Hernandez, Alejandra Melgoza and Marvin Ramirez, dialed 911 following an encounter with Sanchez near their residence. According to the students, first responders on the scene mishandled the situation, mistreating the victim and witnesses based on their race.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College student Marvin Ramirez said Sanchez ran up to him and Hernandez screaming “help!” while bleeding profusely from his right arm.</p>\n<p>“He, like, ran into my arms and I didn’t even have a shirt on, and I felt him and he had a massive cut in his right arm and it was just gushing out blood, and it wasn’t dripping, it was literally flying and it was ridiculous,” Ramirez said. “I knew at the time that it was a matter of time, and we ran inside and tried to get a towel and we tried to take care of him.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Sanchez was restless but was not violent toward the five witnesses.</p>\n<p>“He was a little bit out of control due to the adrenaline, so he was running around from one apartment complex to another, but we attempted to stop him. We sat him down several times,” Ramirez said. “Though it seemed like he was violent, he didn’t do anything to us.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza said she spoke with dispatch and “specifically requested” medical assistance, but was not taken seriously.</p>\n<p>“I was the one who called dispatch and dispatch didn’t believe me,” Melgoza said. “When you have anyone who is pleading for help, saying that there is blood gushing out of a wound — when you have someone who is passed out in front of your doorstep with blood gushing out of a wound, I would expect dispatch to hear the screaming in the background.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year comparative literature and psychology double-major Areli Ariana said EMTs and paramedics who responded to the call displayed a lack of urgency.</p>\n<p>“They literally acted like it was an inconvenience for them to do their job,” Ariana said. “We were yelling at them, and yes we were frantic, but who wouldn’t be if they were covered in blood.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, emergency personnel took a long time to arrive, and police officers and firefighters did not act urgently upon arriving at the scene.</p>\n<p>“I was jumping in front of them and just full of blood and telling them to hurry up and they just walked out of the car,” Ramirez said. “When the firefighters got there they didn’t want to get blood on their suit, and I remember Jocelin screaming at them, ‘If I have blood on me, why can’t you get blood on you! Hurry up, we don’t have time!’”</p>\n<p>Ariana said responders disregarded her and other witnesses’ attempts to explain the situation, but acknowledged a white male bystander who began speaking to them after police arrived.</p>\n<p>“We’re all basically persons of color; there’s no doubt that we’re brown. He just completely bypassed everything we said,” Ariana said. “He didn’t acknowledge our presence — he didn’t recognize us. From the moment we started speaking he ignored us.”</p>\n<p>According to Ariana, the deputies who responded treated Sanchez “brutally” without reason.</p>\n<p>“While Jocelin and I were huddled over Andy, we were able to hold him down and to calm him down while the police officers came,” Ariana said. “When the police officers came, the first thing they did was to grab a baton and try to hold Andy down.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year film and media studies major Ashley Baker said the police officers involved in Sunday night’s incident were not held accountable for their “brutal” treatment of Sanchez.</p>\n<p>“This is the third time in my life that I have witnessed one of my Latino brothers pass away and have it be completely erased the next morning,” Baker said. “Instead of having a thorough investigation they wash everything down. It was like a Hazmat — it  was like it never happened.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, the officer did not have an emergency kit and approached the scene with a baton in hand.</p>\n<p>“One of the other things was that the cop didn’t have an emergency kit, so when they got out they just got out with a baton. What good are you by then?” Ramirez said. “We asked why, and they just said the car did not have it on them. That’s not an excuse because we lost a life, and you don’t know how important that is but that’s a life, a student life.”</p>\n<p>Ariana said Sanchez’s death is likely due to first responders’ misconduct.</p>\n<p>“This is a fellow student of ours who probably died because of the negligence of the EMTs and the paramedics and the police officers,” Ariana said.</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Sanchez’s mother was unaware of the situation the next day due to an incomplete police report, in which the witnesses who called emergency services were not included.</p>\n<p>“You don’t understand how hard it was,” Ramirez said. “And how hard it was for the mother when we saw her the next day and she had no idea about what happened because they didn’t take a thorough report and they didn’t include us in the report.”</p>\n<p>Ariana said IVFP did not have translation services available, which delayed the time it took to notify Sanchez’s family of his death.</p>\n<p>“We found out that his family didn’t speak English, so they needed a translator,” Ariana said. “He [the officer] was very insensitive to that and he did not prioritize communicating the sensitive information to Andy’s family.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza also said emergency responders should have access to translation, especially to Spanish.</p>\n<p>“How many Latino/Latina families are out in Isla Vista?” Melgoza said. “The fact that we don’t have translating services is a disgrace.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez said she wants to stress the “racial dynamics and dimensions” of the law enforcement’s failure to address the situation.</p>\n<p>“It looks like two cops running in and trying to restrain the individual. And they criminalized the individual because they don’t know how to react,” Hernandez said. “They recoiled at the sight of the wound because they’re not trained, that is not somebody that is trained to ensure our safety.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, the police officers did not carry out their responsibility to ensure Sanchez’s well-being.</p>\n<p>“This is a student that meant nothing to us, I’m not even getting paid to care,” Ramirez said. “If we have such urgency why don’t they do everything in their power?”</p>\n<p><em>For the IVFP response: <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">“IVFP Responds to Allegations of Misconduct in Sanchez’s Death.”</a></em></p>\n<p><em>For the SBC Fire response:</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/</a></p>\n<p><em>The </em>Nexus<em> firmly believes in fair comment and is actively seeking comment from all agencies involved in these allegations.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus. <em>The title of this article was edited to better reflect the context in which the statements were delivered. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/","id":4640,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4639,4638,4637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Goings-On in I.V.

Clinic building. The County of Santa Barbara has already granted zoning approval to the former church and bank building at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar, and Third District County Supervisor Doreen Farr secured a $485,000 grant in 2015 toward its refurbishment. That amount is insufficient for what is needed to fully renovate the building, and organizers now meet to figure out how to acquire more capital funds.</p>\n<p><strong>IVRPD</strong><br>\nThe Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) board of directors will be meeting at 6 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 13, in the IVRPD building next to the I.V. Food Co-op. The board of directors regularly meets on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>Debate</strong><br>\nThe Nexus, KCSB and The Bottom Line will co-host a debate between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann, the candidates for Third District County Supervisor. The debate will be Thursday, Oct. 13 at I.V. Theater starting at 6:30 p.m. The debate will also air live on 91.9 FM KCSB.</p>\n<p><strong>Memorial Garden</strong><br>\nIVRPD is having a volunteer work day starting at 2 p.m. on Friday to upkeep the Isla Vista Love &amp; Remembrance Garden at People’s Park. The memorial garden was built in May 2015 to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014 shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Concert in the Park</strong><br>\nThe UCSB Community Housing Office, the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU) and IVRPD are co-hosting a Kick-Off Community Concert on Friday in Anisq’Oyo’ Park (966 Embarcadero Del Mar) from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. The event is for residents to interact with their property providers while listening to live music from local bands Mellow Grass, The Real Savage Henry and The Nitwits. Landlords, managers and owners from over 25 property providers will be at the event. There will also be a photo booth, succulent planting and prize giveaways.</p>\n<p><strong>Vegan</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. on Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>Free Food</strong><br>\nAs part of its Gaucho Food Program, IVTU and the I.V. Food Co-op will be tabling outside the Pardall Center on Wednesday, Oct. 19, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. to give away free food to UCSB students. This food giveaway is regularly held every Wednesday.</p>\n<p><strong>Voters</strong><br>\nCommunity volunteers are currently working to register 13,000 voters in Isla Vista and at UCSB. In years past, UCSB has been one of the top universities in terms of registering voters with as many as 11,000 voters. This year, volunteers hope to set a new record by registering thousands more for the November election. The last day to register is Oct. 24.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/","id":4641,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4640,4639,4638],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
