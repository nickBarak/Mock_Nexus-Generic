Although extremely raw and immature physically, Beeler has shown great potential and is already a capable defender with great hands. According to ESPN, Beeler is the No. 131-ranked power forward.</p>\n<p>“He can run and shot block at this level now,” Williams said of his tallest recruit. “He has got to get way more physical, but his upside is as good as anybody in this class — that is why we had to beat out Washington State and other bigger conference teams to get him, because it’s so hard to find bigs that can run at this level.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mitch Brewe</strong></p>\n<p>Mitch Brewe, a 6’8” forward out of Seattle Prep in Seattle, WA, may have the best chance out of any Gaucho to make an immediate impact as a freshman. Brewe is the No. 65 power forward in this year’s class. The lack of depth in the UCSB frontcourt may allow this 230-pound power forward to contribute as a defender and high-energy post player off the bench.</p>\n<p>“Brewe is very strong, very physical and ready defensively,” Williams said. “He is fundamentally sound and can make an immediate impact as a great screener, defender and ball movement guy.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Michael Bryson</strong></p>\n<p>A 6’4” guard from Foothill High School in Sacramento, CA, Michael Bryson has the all-around game to make an immediate and lasting impact on the program in the coming years. Bryson, the No. 81-ranked shooting guard in his class according to ESPN, is known as a great shooter with range. Despite averaging just over 14 points per game in high school, Bryson attracted coach Williams with his all-around game.</p>\n<p>“He is a good shooter but a better basketball player,” Williams said. “He has got a really good basketball sense and makes a great commitment to the defensive end of the floor. He is a complete player that will only improve.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Dalante Dunklin</strong></p>\n<p>Dalante Dunklin is a 6’0” point guard out of Francis Parker High School in San Diego, CA. The No. 40-ranked point guard according to ESPN, Dunklin is an athletic beast. A strong and active player, Dunklin is a physical presence that can blow by a defender for a dunk or hold his ground defensively. With junior Nate Garth and freshman T.J. Taylor returning as point guards, it is unsure whether Dunklin will redshirt or not, and if he will be able to acquire playing time next season. “[Dalante] is way more of a physical presence than any point guard we have had recently,” Williams said. “I think he is physically ready to come in and play at this level. The adjustments will come within growing up and being a point guard in terms of leadership and all that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Aamahd Walker</strong></p>\n<p>Coach Williams’ latest recruit, Aamahd Walker, committed to attend UCSB after signing a national letter of intent in early April. The 6’2” shooting guard from Culver City High School in Culver City, CA is a natural wing scorer in the mold of recently departed senior shooting guard Orlando Johnson or last year’s recruit, redshirt freshman John Green. According to ESPN, Walker is the No. 69-ranked shooting guard in the nation in his recruiting class.</p>\n<p>Walker averaged 20.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.5 steals, 3.0 assists and 1.1 blocked shots per game during his senior season. He also shot 46 percent from the field, 33 percent from three-point range and 76 percent from the free throw line. Walker’s outstanding performance led to a Second Team All-CIF selection and First Team All-Ocean League.</p>\n<p>“He is really talented offensively — a natural scorer,” Williams said. “If we don’t redshirt him, I would expect him to make an immediate scoring impact. … He made such a commitment of wanting to be here. He really had to work and change certain aspects of his academics and he worked very hard to make it happen.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to the freshmen of this year’s class, UCSB will return three redshirt freshmen in 6’5” guard John Green, 6’8” forward Taran Brown and 6’1” walk-on guard Duke DaRe. The rest of the Gaucho roster is expected to be filled out by three sophomores, two juniors and a lone senior.</p>\n<p>“A lot of how we play and determining which of our freshmen will redshirt next season will depend on our bigs,” coach Williams said. “In Big Al [Williams], we have a legitimate center, but with him off the court we have to play a smaller lineup. If Brewe or Beeler can come in and contribute right away, then we won’t have to worry about catering to our big lineup and our small lineup in different situations.”</p><div

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB men’s basketball team had a triumphant return home Saturday night against the University of San Diego, grinding out a 67-57 victory.</p>\n<p>This was Gauchos’ fifth-straight win, their biggest streak since March 2015, and the team now has as many wins as they had all of last season with a 6-2 record. The Toreros are now building the wrong kind of streak as this was their second loss in a row, and they now sit at 5-2.</p>\n<p>Most of the first half could be summed up with one word: sloppy. The first two minutes included six missed shots, two missed free-throws, two turnovers, and zero points. The Gauchos didn’t even score until three minutes in, when graduate transfer Marcus Jackson took advantage of an errant pass and took it home for a dunk. Jackson finished with an all-around stat line of 12 points 3 rebounds and 4 assists, yet his biggest impact was on the defensive end where he was tasked with facing the Toreros’ best player in Isaiah Wright.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Wright came into the matchup leading his team in almost all offensive categories, and postgame Coach Joe Pasternack reiterated just how important it was for the Gauchos to have held him to only 11 points on 5/14 shooting on the game. “We knew he was the head of the team”, Pasternack expressed. “Marcus and the rest of the squad did a great job cutting off the head and forcing the ball elsewhere”.</p>\n<p>The head of the Gauchos for the first half was Leland King II, who finished the game with yet another double-double performance of 18 points and 12 rebounds. He was the only one who had anything going early on, at one point scoring eight straight points on consecutive trips.</p>\n<p>The forward knew that he was going to have to produce early on for the team to have success. “They were switching the point guard on me so I used my size early on”, he admitted postgame. “It’s all about drawing attention to make the game easier for my teammates”.</p>\n<p>Although guard Olin Carter III had a solid first half for USD, in which he picked up eight points, no other player stepped up for the Toreros which led to a 32-25 lead for UCSB going into halftime.</p>\n<p>The second half was all about digging deep on the defensive end for the Gauchos and just letting the offense flow naturally. This was made much easier by the shooting of Max Heidegger, who after a quiet first half made a few key shots as the game came down to the wire. The 8th leading scorer in the country showcased why he deserves national acclaim, at one point he had consecutive possessions with long Steph Curry-like threes, one of which became and And-1 as he got fouled coming down.</p>\n<p>USD’s best players came out to play in the second half however, as forward Isaiah Pineiro almost had a double double in the half alone, getting 12 points and 8 rebounds. Junior Isaiah Wright also played far better, knocking in 10 points and at one point they had cut the lead down to four points.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, the Gauchos defense was too much for the Toreros. Coach Pasternack emphasized after the game that: “This team’s identity is defense,” and from the way in which the Gauchos performed, it would be hard to argue against him.</p>\n<p>Having a strong and communicative defense is essential for any team that wants to have prolonged success, which is what Coach P and the Gauchos seem to be laying the foundation for now.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

In what has been prematurely deemed one of the best and most important off-seasons in NBA history, the Lakers acquired two future Hall of Famers in Steve Nash and Dwight Howard. But screw that premature praise; the Lakers are going to win the 2013 NBA championship.</p>\n<p>As a Lakers fan, I am absolutely thrilled by the acquisitions of Howard and Nash and on paper, the Lakers should be the most talented team in the league and the front-runner for the championship. However, I want to give caution to both Lakers fans and haters that there will most definitely be bumps in the road. Much like Miami’s first season with “The Big Three”, the Lakers will be heavily scrutinized if they ever lose to a team at the bottom of the standings or go on a three-game-losing streak. Losses will happen; the Lakers will not break records for the most wins in one season, but this will be a supremely talented and entertaining team to watch.</p>\n<p>Miami struggled in its first season to develop chemistry, as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh all struggled to find roles on the Heat. Maybe the Lakers will have some chemistry issues to start the season, but with some of the smartest and hardest-working players in the game, the Lakers’ transition into a poised and cohesive unit should be much faster than that of the Heat.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Pau Gasol, Kobe and Nash possibly have the highest basketball IQ of anyone at their respective positions and Howard is a one-of-a- kind athlete at center. Kobe is no longer 25 years old. He knows he cannot continue to score 30 points a game and he will adapt to the new roster because he will do whatever it takes to win that sixth ring.</p>\n<p>The Lakers might lose a few games early in the season as they find their groove, but come playoff time, they should be the most feared squad in the league and unlike the Heat, finish the first season together as champions.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Point Guard: Steve Nash</strong></p>\n<p>Nash is one of the all-time greats in terms of passing ability and basketball IQ. He is not the most gifted athlete in the world and has never been a great defender, but his abilities on the offensive side of the ball are unquestioned. He averaged over 12 points and 10 assists a game last year. His high assist numbers will be aided by the fact that he is playing with three other All-stars. Expect Nash’s scoring average to stay relatively the same, with his assists rising by one or two a game. Nash can hit the three ball as well, an often forgotten aspect of his game that has been sorely lacking for the Lakers. Starting Shooting Guard: Kobe Bryant</p>\n<p>Kobe is obviously an all-time top-five player. His ability to score in bunches has produced some of the most remarkable performances in the history of the game. At 34 years old, he will not average the nearly 28 points per game he put forth last year. I would say 25 points is a more realistic projection for the guard, with maybe five or six rebounds and assists each a game. With all of the offensive weapons on the team, Kobe’s scoring will drop, but his assist numbers should rise. You know Kobe is hungry for his sixth championship.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Small Forward: Metta World Peace</strong></p>\n<p>World Peace is nowhere near as talented as he was during his days with the Kings and Pacers, but he is still an above average defender.</p>\n<p>Apparently motivated by the new acquisitions, he is in the best shape since his days with the Pacers. If he can perform as he did during the last month of the regular season, where he averaged over 14 points per game, the Lakers will truly have a weapon at each position.</p>\n<p>World Peace will have many opportunities for open shots and if he can knock them down and play tough defense, Los Angeles should be able to beat any team in the league.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Power Forward: Pau Gasol</strong></p>\n<p>Pau’s numbers last year were very inconsistent. He averaged over 17 points per game during the season and nearly 20 during the last month, but his numbers in the playoffs dropped off considerably at under 13 a game. With Howard under the rim, Gasol can play where he is most comfortable — 10-15 feet from the basket — and take more open jumpers. If he can replicate his performance for Spain in this summer’s</p>\n<p>Olympics, he can be one of the top power forwards in the game. When Gasol goes into beast mode, he looks like an</p>\n<p>All-star. The only problem is he lacks that consistent tenacity. Gasol should see a boost in production, as teams will be forced to pay more attention to other weapons on the offense.</p>\n<p>But the main difference between the 2010 Heat and the 2012 Lakers is the unquestioned leadership. Kobe Bryant is the leader of this team. Dwight Howard has even said he is eager to learn from Kobe and is looking forward to being challenged by the hardest working player in the game. Kobe will concede control of the offense to Nash, but control of the game is still his. The same unquestioned leadership could not be said about the Heat.</p>\n<p>LeBron and Wade often struggled in late-game situations, both fighting to be the “Alpha Dog” in the relationship. James had yet to perfect the late-game finishing touch he developed last season. At the end of a game, you know Kobe is taking the last shot if he has it; none of that passing to a backup as LeBron did with Udonis Haslem.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at a position-by-position breakdown for the Lakers and the possible impact each member of the starting five will have on the team this season.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Center: Dwight Howard</strong></p>\n<p>The best big man in the game, Howard is an athletic freak, featuring the speed of a small forward and the power of a center. He opens up the Lakers pick-and-roll game and forces defenders to double-team him so he cannot get to the rim. He may not have a great back to the basket game, but he will have plenty of opportunities to score, especially with Nash passing him the ball. Defensively, Howard is a drastic upgrade over Andrew Bynum and gives the Lakers a defensive presence unmatched in the league.</p>\n<p>The Lake Show will play some entertaining basketball this season. If they can produce on the floor with the talent that they have on paper, this could be a team for the ages. The starting five is set, and with an improved bench consisting of Antawn Jamison, Jordan Hill, Jodie Meeks and Steve Blake, the Lakers have the talent to become champions this season as well as over the next three years. Questions of depth remain for the Lakers, but they possess the most talented starting five in the league. I hope the NBA is ready for an exciting season of basketball.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48072\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-11/powered-starting-lakers-team-beat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48072\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-11/powered-starting-lakers-team-beat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-11/powered-starting-lakers-team-beat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-11/powered-starting-lakers-team-beat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-11/powered-starting-lakers-team-beat/","id":719,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[718,717,716],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Champs Fill the Gaps","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After winning the Big West title this past season, UCSB women’s basketball will look to repeat this feat and claim a second crown with the help of three new recruits next season. “I think they’r...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After winning the Big West title this past season, UCSB women’s basketball will look to repeat this feat and claim a second crown with the help of three new recruits next season.</p>\n<p>“I think they’re great program kids,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “They have a great balance of the academic side of things and also my personality, so they’re going to be kids that get better over their four years.”</p>\n<p>As a first-year head coach, the recruiting process was extremely different given that Mitchell wasn’t announced as the new coach until last May.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

\r\n</script> \n<p>“It was unique because I’d only had one week to work out with our current team,” Mitchell said. “We went on the road in July and we tried to get a top 10 or 12 list just by watching kids play 10 or 12 games with their AAU programs. After that first set of evaluations, we had things narrowed down and we got on the phone and started recruiting these kids like we’d been recruiting them since they were in eighth or ninth grade.”</p>\n<p>The three new recruits will have to help fill the shoes of two outstanding seniors, guard Emilie Johnson and forward Kelsey Adrian. Johnson led the team in scoring at 9.5 points per game, assisted with 2.8 per game and stole with .9 this season. Adrian averaged 6.5 points per game and served as the Gauchos’ three-point threat, leading the team in three-point percentage at 35.8.</p>\n<p>“They gave all they could to the program,” Mitchell said. “Like with all seniors, you respect them, but you move on to the next group.”</p>\n<p>When looking for players, Mitchell had one very key characteristic in mind: versatility.</p>\n<p>“They’re very versatile players,” Mitchell said. “After seeing our team play this year, people know that unless you’re 6’5’’, to me our two, three and four positions are interchangeable. They give us some height on the wings because we were extremely small at times this year and it affected us on the defensive side.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jasmine Ware</strong></p>\n<p>5-foot-10 guard Ware comes to UCSB from Sacramento High. Named the 86th-best guard in the nation by ESPN, Ware averaged 14.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.0 steals and 2.0 assists per game last season.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of coaches probably know they missed one with Jasmine,” Mitchell said. “She’s a defensive stopper. I watched her guard a 6’2’’ kid in a high school game and control the entire game with her defensive mentality.”</p>\n<p>Ware led her team to a 27-7 overall record and a 14-0 mark in league.</p>\n<p>“[Ware] knows how to win and she’s also going to bring the energy that maybe the personality of our kids didn’t have this year,” Mitchell said. “We need to continue to grow with that aspect and know it’s okay to play with a lot of emotion. Jasmine’s going to be one of those that refuses to lose.”</p>\n<p>While Ware is known for her offensive ability, Mitchell looks to take advantage of Ware’s defensive versatility, claiming she could guard positions one through four. “She’s legit 5’10’’, but she plays a lot bigger,” Mitchell said. “She’s extremely long and athletic and just lightning quick from end to end. She’ll be able to help us at times because we struggled to guard bigger, more physical guards.”</p>\n<p><strong>Kendra Morrison</strong></p>\n<p>At first look, Morrison seems very similar to Adrian. Both are versatile players, listed at over six feet tall, but play on the wing and shoot well from behind the arc with Morrison shooting at 33 percent. “Probably the biggest difference, and Kelsey did this later in the season for us to have a chance to win, is that Kendra is really physical,” Mitchell said. “She’s going to want to post at times, so [while] Kelsey came in having the reputation as a shooter, Kendra’s going to be a scorer because she’ll post up and find a way to get to the free throw line.” Last season, Morrison averaged 16.0 points, 8.2 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, 1.5 assists and 1.7 steals per game at Eastlake High in Sammamish, Wash. With a height of 6’1”, Morrison is known as a rebounding guard who can also handle the ball extremely well.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have [sophomore Nicole Nesbit] running the point 90 percent of the time and [sophomore Melissa Zornig] will probably see some time backing her up, but I would never hesitate [to play Kendra],” Mitchell said. “Kendra’s one of those that if you ask her to play one, two, three and four, she has that ability. [She’s] just a blue- collar, ‘I’m going to find a way to win’ [player] and she’s willing to do all the team things.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jessica Pino</strong></p>\n<p>After averaging 12.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, 4.5 blocks, 3.3 assists and 1.4 steals last season, MaxPreps named Pino the 73rd-best player in California.</p>\n<p>“It was funny because she was the first kid on campus when I took the job and her dad was her high school coach and he said she could play the one, two or three,” Mitchell said. “And we went and saw her play and watched some film and I said, ‘She’ll be a dominating four player before she’s done here because of her size.’”</p>\n<p>This 6-foot-3 forward from Chaparral High in Temecula brings height to a UCSB team that was undersized all of last season. Pino also played volleyball, and as a result is known for her athleticism and jumping ability. Mitchell expects her to also play some center.</p>\n<p>“She’s a great passer from the high post area and we do a lot of high-low action,” Mitchell said. “She’s very comfortable shooting the 17-footer or three-pointers at times. She’ll bring that length that we didn’t have.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s first recruiting class will join nine returners, including Big West Tournament MVP and junior center Kirsten Tilleman. Tilleman averaged 6.8 points and 8.4 rebounds (a team high), finding her offensive stride later in the season. In the championship, Tilleman tallied a double-double with 16 points and 11 boards.</p>\n<p>Yet, according to Mitchell, Tilleman may not be the one to step up as the leader, or at least not vocally.</p>\n<p>“I think the person who has taken a backseat her entire career that’s been a great leader for us right now is [junior guard] Angelei Aguirre,” Mitchell said. “Angelei is a little more vocal and where Tilleman is getting out of her comfort level a little more, she always leads by example.”</p>\n<p>With the looks of her team, Mitchell has high hopes for her squad next season.</p>\n<p>“They understand me and what this coach staff wants from them a bit more,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully we’ll get off to a better start next season. We have an extremely difficult, tough schedule, though, (which includes UNLV, BYU, USC and Washington), so we’ll be challenged early and we’ll see our resiliency and if that prepares us for Big West play.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47113\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47113\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/","id":720,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[719,718,717],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
