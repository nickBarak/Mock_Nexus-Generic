Within seconds, Yokota quickly received likes, comments and messages in response to her post.</p>\n<p>“For some reason it just blew up like crazy, so quickly, too. The second I posted it, my phone was blowing up with messages and notifications.”</p>\n<p>At the time of the <em>Nexus</em>’ interview with Yokota, there were a total of 73 members in the GroupMe for Coast Carvers and approximately 100 people who had contacted Yokota about her post, from newcomers to I.V. to experienced skaters to parents asking Yokota to teach their own kids how to skate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83848\" style=\"width: 1368px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83848\" data-attachment-id=\"83848\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/coast-carvers-hit-the-streets-of-isla-vista/unnamed-2-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1358%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1358,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83848\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C1339\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1339\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1358&amp;ssl=1 1358w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1158&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 679w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83848\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Masaki Osato</em></p></div>\n<p>Yokota founded the group after taking interest in a similar female skating group based out of Venice Beach called GRLSWRL, which is “a modern-retro all-female stoke-chasing community focused on bringing femininity… to the male dominated skate scene,” according to the group’s website.</p>\n<p>Yokota was never able to attend one of GRLSWRL’s bi-weekly scheduled skate sessions, but from meeting up for casual skate sessions with some of the members, she felt that I.V. would provide the ideal space for a group with similar purposes.<br>\n“It’s something that Isla Vista kind of needed, but nobody knew it needed that,” Yokota said.</p>\n<p>Although they have similar missions, the two groups hold some key differences, such as Coast Carvers’ inclusion of “anything that shreds in I.V.,” namely roller-skating and surfing in addition to skating. Yokota says this inclusion is ideal for their group given the diversity of sports and hobbies practiced by girls in I.V.</p>\n<p>Yokota also notes variations in the general energy and mood of the two skate groups, which she attributes to the differences of the locations that each group call home.</p>\n<p>“[In Venice] there’s just a bunch of random people and strangers and it’s really crowded, it’s kind of stressful,” Yokota said. “But then when I skated on DP, it was a Sunday evening and I just had my nine girls with me, and it was just really peaceful honestly.”</p>\n<p>Being a girl in the world of skating can prove to be intimidating for many people, she said. The seemingly overwhelming proportion of men to women who skate can make it difficult for women feel confident attending skateparks and the like, but skating in groups like Coast Carvers can afford them a sense of support and companionship, according to Yokota.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to full-send something when you’re just scared… so having girls around you just kind of builds your confidence,” Yokota said. “I don’t want girls to feel like they can’t do things just because they are girls or because there aren’t enough girls doing something.”</p>\n<p>Yokota is hopeful that Coast Carvers will continue to grow once the academic year begins. At that time, she plans to have scheduled skate sessions during the week and wants to eventually create an executive board to help run the club.</p>\n<p>Depending on the success of the group in the next year, Yokota has also been toying with the idea of expanding Coast Carvers into a multi-chapter organization in order to create a network of girl skaters both locally and regionally.</p>\n<p>“That’s what called out to me, is that I could be a part of something bigger.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

With mostly losses intertwined between the minority victories, the Aggies are certainly hoping for a better result in their games against the Gauchos before the end of the team’s current homestand.</p>\n<p>Jack Dashwood looks to be the probable starter for UCSB on Friday’s opening match and the southpaw will be making a start at a point in the season where he has run into more trouble than he’d like to have seen as of late.</p>\n<p>The freshman has a 2-5 record on the year and his previous start to begin the series against UC Irvine was his worst outing on the mound all season. The 18.90 ERA and ten hits allowed over 3.1 innings pitched are all season-low marks in each category.</p>\n<p>Dashwood had been getting it together before his disastrous start against UCI, since the March 9th game against Texas State he had gone for at least five innings, allowed a less than 1.50 ERA, excluding a March 19th start, and held a 2-3 record. The lefty and his team are hoping he can bounce back to set a strong tone early in the series against Davis.</p>\n<p>Junior Ryan Anderson leads UC Davis in batting average, (.391), hits (50), and runs (26) alongside junior Caleb van Blake, who leads the team in RBIs with 28, have been major parts of the Aggie offense.</p>\n<p>In Davis’ last 16-10 victory, both Anderson and van Blake homered in the game with van Blake’s shot being a huge grand slam in the third inning to tie up the score.</p>\n<p>For a team who has not done a lot of winning this season, in the games, the Aggies have won offense has not been a problem as all of their victories have come when the team has scored seven or more runs.</p>\n<p>The key to victory for the Gauchos this series very well could lie in keeping the Aggies guessing at the plate and getting good pitching to keep them quiet.</p>\n<p>The team has a good coincidence of timing as early opportunities to jump ahead in the standings do not come often and the mindset for UCSB must be to come out strong should they desire to quickly improve their record.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will begin their series against the Aggies on Friday, April 20 – April 23.

The .341 average hitter has been a consistent and dangerous offensive threat for the Roadrunners and will be a problem for the Gauchos’ pitching rotation.</p>\n<p>Despite making a huge impact early on in the Riverside series, sophomore Tommy Jew and junior Clay Fisher quieted down a bit in their final game gathering a combined three hits. The three hit total is an average outcome compared to Fisher’s perfect day at the plate the day before and Jew’s four hit two RBI performance the day before that.</p>\n<p>The dynamic duo have been the Gauchos’ top two offensive producers on the season with the two occupying the top places in the major offensive categories. Williams has been getting hot as of late as the freshman has shown an ability to get key hits for his team that result in runs on the board.</p>\n<p>The Roadrunner pitching staff which struggled much like the Gauchos’ against Riverside will be looking to bounce back against Fisher, Jew, and the others.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still .500 in the Big West Conference, having a record of six wins and six losses. The record is enough to put them at fourth in the conference and will be a good preview game as CSU Bakersfield will be joining the Gauchos in the Conference in 2022.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/gauchos-hoping-to-bounce-back-from-series-loss-travels-to-bakersfield/","id":4274,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4273,4272,4271],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kayakers Safely Return To Shore Following Police Water Rescue Call","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2018-08-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Best-Date-Spot-Campus-Point-by-Tatiana-Karme-Scalisi.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Best-Date-Spot-Campus-Point-by-Tatiana-Karme-Scalisi.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"They later said they were “somewhat unstable” in the water and were concerned because it had become dark outside.
