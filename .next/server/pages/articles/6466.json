Why is Jan. 1, 2020 the ideal date to change our life choices? The new year has become a symbolic marker of new beginnings, but is a date devoid of any actual meaning. The most popular resolutions revolve around losing weight, getting rid of bad habits or the vague intention of thinking more positively. Others set more specific goals, like to read more books or to get a better job, goals which often are pursued at the start of the year but end up forgotten and are never accomplished.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91963\" style=\"width: 422px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91963\" data-attachment-id=\"91963\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-11/a-fresh-take-on-the-new-year/new-years-illustration/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/New-years-Illustration-e1578685171548.png?fit=650%2C464&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,464\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New years Illustration\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/New-years-Illustration-e1578685171548.png?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/New-years-Illustration-e1578685171548.png?fit=888%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-91963\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/New-years-Illustration-e1578685171548.png?resize=412%2C294\" alt=\"\" width=\"412\" height=\"294\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-91963\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alex Garcia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many New Year’s resolutions go unfulfilled because they provide </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/smarter-living/new-years-resolutions.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delayed rather than instant gratification.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If we can’t see the short-term rewards of our goals, we grow apathetic. This is why New Year’s resolutions tend to be a pathway to superficiality, resolving the need to look rather than actually feel better. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new year has never felt like a new start for me. I have never once told myself: “Wow, remember 2017? That was a particularly good year.” The new year is a good time to reflect on the accomplishments, growth and memories of the past year. I could easily remember 2019 as the year that I had my first car accident, my first annoying boss or my first time feeling generally confused about my future. Rather, I choose to think of 2019 as a year of accomplishing a lot academically, building my resume and gaining a newfound sense of confidence. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I think back on it, I have changed a lot over the course of 2019. While I went into college with a certain sense of independence, I was still very naive. I pursued opportunities that made me happy instead of ones that I thought</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would look good on a resume, but I tended to question whether I was doing enough to prove my self-worth. The confident attitude I gained towards the beginning of 2019 was not crafted by a “New Year’s resolution” but an attitude I naturally developed in order to get what I wanted out of life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I, like the rest of the population, have personality traits I could “work” on in the new year, I don’t think bad habits can be forced out just because people tell us they should or because we grow to hate that part of ourselves. The new year should instead be looked at as an opportunity for self evaluation. Are the people in our lives and the academic endeavors we’re pursuing making us happy and excited for the future? If the answer is no, I think it is on us to make a change in the new year. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think bad habits can be forced out just because people tell us they should or because we grow to hate that part of ourselves.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I ended this quarter feeling a little drained, like I was stuck in an endless routine. So for 2020, I plan to try new things that are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> geared towards success but towards general enjoyment. We should value our time in 2020 and maximize it towards its fullest potential. We should spend time making our own lives feel balanced, prioritizing our needs as well as the needs of others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new year can also be looked at as an opportunity to be civically engaged by taking on work that affects the community in a positive way. Giving back strays from the typical New Year’s resolution that is geared directly towards personal growth, but it can still be an influencing factor in our futures. Getting involved in my student newspaper, helping educate elementary students about tree species and registering students to vote are all things I have been involved in this past year and have allowed me to contribute to my community as well as my sense of individuality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the new year often involves meeting new people, having new experiences and forming new social circles. While this seems exciting, one thing I have learned in 2019 is to not leave your old friends behind. We can often get swept up in new romances, friends and groups that make us forget we need to make an active effort to reconnect with people who have been there when we’ve needed them in the past. I’ve reconnected with people I hadn’t talked to in a long time over winter break and am subsequently happier because of it. So reach out to your childhood best friend, old neighbor or extended family. Ultimately, it could affect both your life and theirs for the better.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to popular belief, the new year does not necessarily need to be a period of change for everyone. Instead of thinking of the new year as a chance to kick a habit you’ll probably end up keeping, reexamine your daily routine and carve out more time for your own personal enjoyment and stability.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai thinks the new year is a good time for celebration, reflection and natural change rather than arbitrary resolutions. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

With the public health crisis gaining status as a pandemic, and more and more cases of those infected with the virus emerging both in the U.S. and abroad, this is a catastrophe that no one has ever experienced in their lifetime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In such bleak times, it is natural that a nation would look towards its leader for guidance. Unfortunately for the U.S., Donald Trump has mismanaged this crisis from the outset. Although it appears that he is finally starting to grasp the severity of it, his initial denial and spread of misinformation has only made things worse.

He has referred to the coronavirus as </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/29/21159294/trump-coronavirus-hoax-south-carolina-first-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“fake news,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his trademark dismissal for all events that don’t align with his agenda. Trump has also </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-calls-coronavirus-democrats-new-hoax-n1145721\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Democrats’ criticism of his response to coronavirus is a“hoax” that was created to hurt Trump’s 2020 political campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s utter dismissal of the threat of coronavirus demonstrates his thorough lack of preparation and education on the subject. Even when he was later asked if he regretted his word choice, Trump said no. He claimed that he was proving he was capable of handling the Democratic “hoax” because his administration is doing </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/29/21159294/trump-coronavirus-hoax-south-carolina-first-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“such a good job” </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of handling the virus. This is simply not true, as the Trump administration has consistently fumbled its attempts to contain the spread of the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late February 2020, the U.S. government had to decide if 14 individuals from the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-americans/2020/02/20/b6f54cae-5279-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diamond Princess cruise ship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who had tested positive for coronavirus should be flown home from Japan with a group of over 300 healthy individuals. The CDC strongly advised against this explaining that the infected individuals could easily spread the disease to healthy passengers. The US government decided to ignore this warning. Trump </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-was-not-told-coronavirus-infected-americans-would-be-flown-home-from-cruise-ship/2020/02/21/ae58b24c-54be-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claimed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after the fact that he was not aware of the government’s decision to do so, which is hard to believe. Even if that were true, that he would be so unaware of such an important decision is a blaring display of his incompetence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s portrayal of coronavirus as the </span><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/newsfeed/2020/03/trump-defends-calling-coronavirus-chinese-virus-200323102618665.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“China Virus”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is racist. Trump is so worried about getting blamed for mismanaging the virus that he has resorted to pointing fingers elsewhere, carelessly fueling racial tensions in the process. We as a nation have unfortunately gotten used to Trump’s nonsensical rants, but this is especially unacceptable when time is of the essence and the country is in a state of full-fledged panic. We need a leader, not someone who is out to serve his own interests. Instead of guiding the U.S. through these trying times, Trump is putting Asian Americans at risk for hate crimes because he is so intent on deflecting blame. At the end of the day, this is an egotistical and self-serving approach because it does little to address the real problem and will do absolutely nothing to stop the spread of the virus. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Trump is concerned, perhaps there is comfort to be found in looking forward to the 2020 election.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One can truly see the extent of Trump’s failings by looking at how other leaders are handling the situation. For example, South Korea has also experienced a significant number of outbreaks, but their </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/17/south-koreas-coronavirus-success-story-underscores-how-us-initially-failed/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">response</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was prompt and aggressive, unlike that of the US. The South Korean government made testing readily available in order to determine the number of cases and isolate those who were infected for treatment. The South Korean government was also more transparent with the information they presented to the public, with the effect of decreasing feelings of panic. As a result of these measures, South Korea has managed to </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slow the rate of infection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Testing in the U.S., on the other hand, has been more of a reactionary measure than the preventative one it should be and is </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/18/817768723/u-s-coronavirus-testing-starts-to-ramp-up-but-still-lags\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still not widely available</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by any means. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, Trump’s ineffectiveness in dealing with the coronavirus is having — and will continue to have — dire consequences. The worst-case scenario for the US is </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/19/coronavirus-projections-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.2 million deaths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an overwhelming amount of people lacking medical care due to a shortage of  hospital beds and doctors being forced to make heartbreaking decisions in terms of who to provide treatment to. The need for all these restrictions, including school closures and lockdowns, is to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“flatten the curve”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to contain the spread of the virus as much as possible. Our healthcare system does not have infinite resources and we need to be careful not to overload it. It’s also necessary that we try to make supplies last longer, even if that results in a longer battle against the virus. We need only buy as many resources as necessary while making sure that our neighbors also have equal access to them. Now is not the time to let panic take control and for us to hoard essentials like toilet paper and hand sanitizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is easy to get distracted by the problematic nature of Trump’s leadership, we as citizens must do our part to prevent the virus from spreading. These restrictions are a hassle. Being asked to abruptly move out of Isla Vista and transition into online classes are huge disappointments, especially for graduating seniors. Unfortunately, this is a developing situation and one we must adapt to by practicing effective social distancing and good hygiene. Where Trump is concerned, perhaps there is comfort to be found in looking forward to the 2020 election. It will provide an opportunity for the American people to condemn Trump for the despicable way he is handling this crisis while using their vote to select a better leader for the future. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop is dismayed by Trump’s ineffectual and racist handling of coronavirus and urges individuals to do their best to help contain it.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.

It is unacceptable that certain politicians feel that they can abuse their power and take away a woman’s right to choose, especially during a time when there are countless other stressors dominating people’s everyday lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The spread of coronavirus has caused unemployment rates to skyrocket, made the simple act of grocery shopping a daunting task and left countless families without basic resources. If a woman decides that she is not capable of bringing her pregnancy to completion, she needs to have the ability to make that decision at all times. This is especially true during a pandemic when the risks to her health and well-being are intensified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those in favor of reproductive rights have demonstrated how unacceptable it is that politicians would infringe upon women’s rights in an already tumultuous time. </span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/00673bc8506133c7a7056c055f001f48\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genevieve Scott,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a senior staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, has argued against the abortion ban in Tennessee.

The AMA directly referred to how elected officials are “exploiting this moment” and bringing politics into a decision that should be purely medical. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the amount of medical supplies that proponents of the abortion bans claim would be conserved is</span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/00673bc8506133c7a7056c055f001f48\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not significant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The foundation of the argument to implement these abortion bans has absolutely no backing. Regardless, certain states are continuing to force these bans into effect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, it is up to the healthcare professionals to decide if a medical procedure is essential.

Ever since I was old enough to know what medicine was, I claimed becoming a doctor as my passion — it felt natural to me. So natural, in fact, that I selectively ignored just how boring I actually found the subject and how much trouble I had understanding it. I held onto this supposed passion of mine while entering college, where I decided I would pursue the pre-med path. Several chemistry classes and many mental breakdowns later, I realized there was nothing I dreaded more than spending the next decade of my life studying the natural sciences. I personally could not bring myself to care about studying them in the slightest. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I switched my major to psychology and communication, subjects that, don’t get me wrong, I find interesting and enjoy learning about, but I still wouldn’t call either of them my passion. I’ve struggled with the idea that something must be inherently wrong with me if I can’t find just one thing I could be passionate enough to devote my life to. Trying every academic subject and personal hobby under the sun hasn’t ignited some magical spark of interest that would tell me what to do with my life, but that’s okay. It’s kind of a hard idea to come to terms with, but I’m becoming more comfortable with it. It always seemed like everyone around me had found their calling, but I’ve discovered that I’m actually far from alone in this struggle.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying every academic subject and personal hobby under the sun hasn’t ignited some magical spark of interest that would tell me what to do with my life, but that’s okay.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College is allegedly the time when we should discover this one elusive passion, and I think this idea adds another unnecessary imperative to the list of things we, as students, need to be concerned about. Pressure is high during these years. The world, and us, wonder what we’re going to do with our lives. I find the idea that you need to, or should, spend your life following your “passion” unrealistic and limiting. It undermines everything that you pursue that isn’t done in the name of a passion, and the value of living without one. Your life can be complete and fulfilling without having that one particular thing that you’re living for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not often that a person is lucky enough to have always known exactly what they wanted to do with their life and that this interest is really as exciting and fulfilling as they expected. What I was passionate about when I was younger isn’t what I’m passionate about now, and what I’m passionate about now most likely won’t be what I’m passionate about many years in the future. There are things I’m passionate about, sure, but I can’t limit myself by saying that I have just one passion. I like to believe that having a passion is not a goal, or a life plan, or a major in college. It’s a feeling that can change given your circumstances and interests — a feeling that you can’t plan your life around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think you can have a purposeful life without passion, by doing things that bring meaning to your life. You really don’t have to have, or eventually find, your one true passion and spend your life pursuing it. I think it’s completely okay not to have one at all. You might discover a passion eventually, or you might not, and frankly, it doesn’t matter either way. As long as you devote your time to endeavors that you believe are valuable, help others or bring happiness to your life, that’s just fine too. A life not dedicated to a strong interest is still a life worth living and one full of important contributions to society. Uncertainty is scary, and uncertainty about something as important as your direction in life is even scarier, but I think it’s okay not to know where you’re going. What matters is that you live in a way that’s important to you. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veronica Vo is very passionate about not having a passion.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/veronicavo/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pic.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/veronicavo/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Veronica Vo</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Veronica Vo is an opinion staff writer and a second year psychology major.
