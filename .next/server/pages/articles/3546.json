student regent-designate — both of which are currently held by UC graduate students, Huang said in an email sent out to all UC student newspapers.</p>\n<p>“Eliminating the Student Advisor position strips away essential student representation at the highest level of UC governance and rejects years of hard-fought work to bring the student voice into university governance,” Huang said in the email.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/regents.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2132214360\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85424\">letter sent to the Regents</a>, Regent Richard Sherman recommended the position be eliminated because of the existence of other opportunities for student representation on the board, such as the positions of Student Advocates to the Regents and Student Observers to Standing Committees.</p>\n<p>If the Regents vote to remove the position, there will no longer be an undergraduate student representative serving on the board after Huang’s term ends in June 2019.</p>\n<p>The intended goal of the Student Advisor position was to provide insight on the issues and concerns of the student populations not represented by the Student Regent, according to Sherman’s letter.</p>\n<p>Student Regent Devon Graves recommended the removal of the position, Huang said.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Student-Regent-Graves-Statement-Re-Student-Advisor-Pilot-Program.pdf\">separate press release</a>, Graves said he made the recommendation on the basis of student perspectives from UCSA, UC Graduate and Professional Council (UCGPC) and Council of Presidents, which reflected that other programs are more effective in representing student voices than the Student Advisor position.</p>\n<p>He also said he wants to support “other opportunities to ensure a diversity of student perspectives” while transitioning out of the student advisor position.</p>\n<p>UC Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/regents-to-vote-on-student-advisor-proposal/\">originally voted</a> on the creation of the position in 2016 after it was proposed by Avi Oved, the student regent and a UC Los Angeles student at the time.</p>\n<p>The Board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/regents-approve-student-advisor-position-for-trial-period/\">passed the proposal</a> unanimously and agreed to a two-year trial for the position, at the end of which the Regents would assess the effectiveness of the position.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Dec. 29]: Huang later recanted his statement about UCSA. UCSA does not support the removal of the position. This article has been updated to reflect this new information. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

We bought a tandem bicycle when we came to California. … Our lives were welded together on the tandem.”</p>\n<p>While John teaches various sociology courses, Janice focuses solely on the pair’s classes on human sexuality.</p>\n<p>“I’m just hired for sex,” Janice joked.</p>\n<p>“You sound like a sex worker,” John teased.</p>\n<p>The pair moved from randy to affectionate as Janice listed the numerous reasons she loves her husband, naming kindness, intelligence, sincerity and dedication, among others.</p>\n<p>“His cute little face,” she said. “He makes so many funny faces, you’d be amazed. … He’s a lot of fun. He’s dedicated to making our life as good as it can be together. And he fits in some cute little jeans.”</p>\n<p>“Superficial Janice,” James said in jest.</p>\n<p>James also expressed admiration for his significant other.</p>\n<p>“She creates so many wonderful moments for us,” he said. “Our life is charmed.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, the pair stressed their dedication to physical fitness. John and Janice, 69 years old and 64 years old, respectively, hike regularly and are able to trek 3,200 ft. in one hour and 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>John also said that intimacy is crucial to a healthy relationship and taking frequent mini-vacations allow the pair to spend much-needed personal time with one another.</p>\n<p>“We spend a lot of time being intimate with each other so these vacations are very special,” he said. “We like the intimacy that comes from sitting and talking about plans; where to go next.”</p>\n<p><b>The Twins</b></p>\n<p>Charles and Dolly Mullin, both communication professors, have distinctive teaching methodologies, but are surprisingly alike in their personalities — a fit that makes the couple like two peas in a pod.</p>\n<p>The pair first realized the likeness as undergraduates at UCLA when pulling all-nighters to watch David Letterman and discuss Scottish music. According to Dolly, the two never tried to look their best during those long nights, which allowed them to fall in love with each other’s personalities instead of focusing on physical appearance.</p>\n<p>“It was certainly comfort and familiarity at first sight,” Charles said. “It was a perfect fit right away.”</p>\n<p>According to Charles, the two eventually decided to attend UCSB for graduate school, where they stayed to teach asfaculty lecturers.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to get your Ph.D someplace and stay at that institution to teach,” he said. “We had more or less committed emotionally and spiritually to staying at UCSB, which may have factored into our decision to not go into a tenure track elsewhere.”</p>\n<p>Aside from admiring his intelligence and strong sense of principle, Dolly said she trusts her partner completely.</p>\n<p>“We think the same way on so many issues,” she said. “I trust his judgment on just about everything.”</p>\n<p>Charles, on the other hand, said he is thankful for Dolly’s selflessness.</p>\n<p>“You take care of me, which I appreciate,” he said. “You look after the things I don’t like to do for myself, like taxes and stuff. We both do stuff that the other person doesn’t want to.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the Mullins, the communication department, which has been dubbed Noah’s Ark, also houses four other couples.</p>\n<p>Although some married couples prefer to keep their professional lives separate from their personal ones, Dolly said working together can be beneficial.</p>\n<p>“We know each other’s stresses,” she said. “It’s hard [when you have] different jobs and don’t know why the other is worried.”</p>\n<p>Aside from working, living and volunteering together, the pair also commutes from Santa Ynez — a 50-minute drive — together. Charles joked that he forced Dolly to adopt a rural lifestyle.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if you marry a person who’s optimal for you,” he said. “You marry them and mold them. … I sometimes like to say I dragged [Dolly] out there [to Santa Ynez].”</p>\n<p>“But I went willing,” Dolly said.</p>\n<p>“It’s like Green Acres,” Charles joked. “I’m Eddie Albert.”</p>\n<p>“And I’m Eva Gabor,” Dolly said, as though reading her husband’s mind.</p>\n<p><b>The Honeymooners</b></p>\n<p>Although married for eight years, physics professor Tommaso Treu and history professor Stefania Tutino can easily be mistaken for newlyweds.</p>\n<p>Aside from holding hands, exchanging loving glances and kissing, the pair is also so bright-eyed when speaking about each other that an onlooker would suspect they were honeymooners.</p>\n<p> The couple first met over a decade ago when attending Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy. Their different academic callings, however, forced them to live apart during a portion of their relationship. The two finally reunited years later while pursuing post doctorate degrees at UCLA.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard for two academic people [to maintain a relationship],” Stefania said. “There’s a lot of work behind it.”</p>\n<p>Despite the hard work, Tommaso said he would do anything for the pair to stay together.</p>\n<p>“She’s the most interesting, intelligent person I’ve met,” Tommaso said. “You never get bored with Stefania.”</p>\n<p>Thankfully, UCSB is a very supportive institution for spouses, the couple said.</p>\n<p>“They understand that academics are married to academics,” Tommaso said. “It’s a wise thing for the institution. [They] don’t want professors to constantly leave [to go visit spouses].”</p>\n<p>Despite specializing in distinct disciplines, the professors teach a class together, Stefania said.</p>\n<p>“We do a lot of cross-collaborations,” she said. “We teach a class on the origins of cosmology from a physics- history-religious studies perspective.”</p>\n<p>Working alongside each other sometimes creates competition, she noted.</p>\n<p>“Academics are competitive in many ways,” Stefania said. “It’s actually a way to make each other better. It fosters each other’s potential.”</p>\n<p>Like their contrasting areas of study, Stefania said the duo’s personalities are complementary.</p>\n<p>“It’s easy to be in different fields,” she said. “The same would be too close to home. Being in different fields makes it healthy.”</p>\n<p>“Healthier,” Tommaso added.</p>\n<p>The couple also has affectionate names for one another. Tommaso calls Stefania “gentleman,” while she calls him “Mr. Bennet” when annoyed, referencing Pride and Prejudice.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Stefania said Tommaso has had an immeasurable impact on her life.</p>\n<p>“When you spend a third of your life with someone, it’s hard to remember the way it was before,” she said. “We’ve been there for each other for a long time, at the most critical stages. We see each other grow, influencing as we observe.”</p>\n<p>Tommaso also said he has learned a great deal from his wife.</p>\n<p>“It’s a lot easier to ask what didn’t she teach me,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20236\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20236\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-12/love-lessons/","id":3543,"author":{"id":334,"name":"Maane Khatchatourian"},"related":[3542,3541,3540],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Forty years ago, a mob of students stormed the Bank of America building.","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the night of Feb. 25, 1970, second-year student Greg Desilet grabbed his camera from his apartment on El Nido Lane and joined the crowds swarming the streets of Isla Vista.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On the night of Feb. 25, 1970, second-year student Greg Desilet grabbed his camera from his apartment on El Nido Lane and joined the crowds swarming the streets of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>After a year of high tension, unrest and anger, rioting students had looted and set fire to the local Bank of America, which stood on the site of today’s Embarcadero Hall.</p>\n<p>“It was quite an extraordinary scene that night,” Desilet said. “People were in all kinds of different moods — happy, celebrating, freaked out, others shocked, stunned by what was going on.

As a group of students walked back toward Isla Vista after the speech, police beat 22-year-old student Rich Underwood into submission and arrested him for carrying a bottle of wine they assumed was a Molotov cocktail.</p>\n<p>“Imagine being in Harder Stadium and having the lawyer of a high-profile national trial … draw connections between what has been happening nationally with what has been happening on campus,” then-Santa Barbara City College student and KCSB broadcaster Malcolm Gault-Williams said. “And then imagine a large part of those attendees leave the stadium and … watch as police not just arrest a student but beat the shit out of him.”</p>\n<p>According to John Riley, a second-year student living on Del Playa Drive at the time, the police’s actions fueled student anger.</p>\n<p>“Cops arrested this guy and set everything off,” Riley said. “It was like throwing a match into a gasoline can, everybody just went nuts.”</p>\n<p>Later that night, the bank was looted and set on fire on two separate occasions — once between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m. when a dumpster was lit on fire and once around midnight when gasoline was used to rekindle the blaze.</p>\n<p>According to Professor Emeritus Richard Flacks, a well-known liberal leader whose appointment to the Sociology Dept. in 1969 caused a stir among conservatives including then-Governor Ronald Reagan, the burning of the bank was not a premeditated event.</p>\n<p>“By evening I would guess hundreds of people were in the street and at some point people lit a trash dumpster and pushed it through the bank doors,” Flacks said. “I kind of never believed people thought that would happen.”</p>\n<p>Some students saw the bank as a symbol of big business, capitalism and the Vietnam War, citing its ties to the defense industry.</p>\n<p>“It was the biggest capitalist thing around,” Becca Wilson, a fourth-year student and then-editor in chief of El Gaucho, the predecessor to the Daily Nexus, said. “It was a symbol of the corporations that benefited from war and were oppressing people all over world, in whose interest government was acting.”</p>\n<p>Others maintain that the bank was burned purely out of anger and frustration with overwhelming police presence.</p>\n<p>“The day afterwards a lot of it was rationalized as anti-war,” Desilet said. “The bank was seen to be in league with defense corporations providing armaments for Vietnam. That was the rationale given, but in my view it was more. It was locally centered with a lot of local anger toward police that had developed over time.”</p>\n<p>“People were just pissed off. They were really pissed off”</p>\n<p>The 1969-70 year was tumultuous in the school’s history, with tension on campus growing alongside national unrest and disagreement over the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>The voting age in 1970 was 21, but after the lottery system was instituted for the draft, many younger students received numbers that increased their chances of deployment after graduation.</p>\n<p>Wilson said that the draft was what really brought the reality of the war home to students.</p>\n<p>“When I started in fall of 1966, there were literally a handful of people demonstrating, just a quiet little vigil in front of the library,” she said. “Three years later it was a widespread movement where probably most students were against the war. By that time, students started to be drafted. It changed the whole atmosphere, became much more personal.”</p>\n<p>The charged political climate of the time was evident well beyond the confines of Isla Vista, too.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine now, but the whole country was just boiling then, with the Chicago Seven, the war, people getting drafted … the whole country was pretty well out of control,” Riley said.</p>\n<p>According to Desilet, many of the students targeted their rage at the ever-present law enforcement officers patrolling Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Tensions were high in I.V. toward anything and anyone who represented enforcement of the status quo, and the most immediate and visible representatives of this status quo line of defense turned out to be police and narcotics agents,” Desilet said. “The accumulated rage of the disenfranchised and the waiting and unwilling recruits in line for Vietnam landed squarely on the county sheriff and his agents.”</p>\n<p>On top of this, the growing drug culture and hippie lifestyle of the time widened the generation gap between students and police, who patrolled Isla Vista and campus in riot gear, often using tear gas to disperse crowds.</p>\n<p>“There was nobody over 25, hardly, and this counter culture, drug culture climate, which meant police were unable to understand, or appreciate Isla Vista so to speak,” Flacks said. “[The police] really thought the students were bad guys and that they were at odds with students. And vice versa. Students knew if they were driving [a] Volkswagen van painted up or generally had long hair hippy attire you were going to be harassed by police, stopped in traffic, pulled over, etc.”</p>\n<p>Although many students were not embroiled in conflict with the police and demonstrations against the war, anger was the primary motivation for those who played a role in the burning of the bank.</p>\n<p>An Occupied Territory</p>\n<p>Once the smoke cleared on Feb. 26 — with the Bank of America building in ruins — Gov. Reagan declared a state of emergency.</p>\n<p>“[Isla Vista] was just dramatically changed,” Gault-Williams said. “Everybody was walking on eggshells. Some were happy, some angry … all kinds of moods. Everyone began to unite even more so after the bank burning in respect to police.”</p>\n<p>A curfew was instituted in Isla Vista and nearly 300 people were arrested and taken to the county jail.</p>\n<p>“Everybody sensed huge confrontation the night after,” Desilet explained. “I went out on street again to photograph in the early evening. When I was on Ocean Road taking pictures of police in the San Rafael parking lot … they arrested me and I was taken to their staging area. We were then bussed out to fire station down on Storke Road and eventually over to the new county jail, which was so new that they didn’t even have it open yet.”</p>\n<p>The National Guard and Los Angeles County SWAT teams were called in to help maintain order. Bank of America declared that it would not withdraw from Isla Vista and constructed a trailer as a makeshift bank, which quickly became the target of numerous demonstrations.</p>\n<p>On April 18, a rally was scheduled against the temporary bank. Associated Students President Bill James went on the radio to speak against further violence, urging students to protect the bank from vandalism.</p>\n<p>Police arrived in armored trucks, dressed in riot gear and armed with tear gas. Amid the confusion, 22-year-old UCSB student Kevin Moran was shot and killed.</p>\n<p>Although the police claimed the bullet originated from a sniper in the crowd, a ballistics test determined that it came from a policeman’s rifle. The incident was deemed an accident, and the officer was later exonerated.</p>\n<p>On June 3, 17 students were indicted for the bank burning, after supposedly being identified from photographs taken on Feb. 25.  The indictments were met with controversy, however, as several of the students had solid alibis.</p>\n<p>“What was obvious was that they were all well-known campus activist radical leaders,” Flacks said. “The idea that that particular group of well-known people were all together around that dumpster was outlandish. Especially since some of them were among those arrested the day before and were actually in jail when the bank burned.”</p>\n<p>“Social Change, Fair Play and Peace”</p>\n<p>The rallies, tear gas and arrests continued throughout the course of the year, and according to former students, fundamentally changed the face of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The riots destroyed the town,” Riley said. “Before the riots it was this cute little town, nice cinemas, new bookstores, more like a Santa Cruz or something, and after it was … burned out. It just destroyed the town.”</p>\n<p>Yet a new Isla Vista emerged from the smoldering ruins of the Bank of America.</p>\n<p>“It suddenly created a lot of attention on Isla Vista itself and how students were living and sparked the creation of many community organizations and grassroots movements that turned into institutions,” Wilson said.</p>\n<p>The Bank of America closed its Isla Vista branch in 1981, opting to open an ATM on Embarcadero del Norte instead. Embarcadero Hall stands in place of the bank today.

I won’t put it out there unless it’s the right situation.”</p>\n<p>On one occasion, though, Zavala did speak up and the reaction surprised him.</p>\n<p>“One guy came up to me after the class and thanked me for my service,” Zavala said. “I didn’t know what to say.”</p>\n<p>Tonight, Student Veterans at UCSB — which Zavala joined when he arrived at the campus — will be hosting its third Ask-A-Vet forum in the Student Resource Building Multipurpose Room at 7:30.</p>\n<p>“We’ll focus on the experiences of student veterans in the military, the transitional challenges and how it becomes our war from the military to the university,” Student Veteran Organization at UCSB President Quincy Yamada said.</p>\n<p>Every day, former active duty Marine Sgt. David Holmes noted, students go to class with military veterans without realizing the depth of their experiences.</p>\n<p>“The majority of vets volunteer because they want to serve the country. It’s a huge sacrifice to serve in deployments, the time you give up,” Holmes, a graduate student in education,  said. “Eighteen to twenty-two. Those are the prime years of your life, and you gave them to your country.”</p>\n<p><b>A Different Way to Study Abroad</b></p>\n<p>Quincy Yamada, a business economics major with accounting emphasis, enlisted in the Navy just after graduating high school. From his permanent duty station in Japan, he worked as an aircraft mechanic and spent over a year at sea during his four years of foreign service.</p>\n<p>For Justus Hanna, a combat engineer who worked in demolitions, his military service took him across Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan. Hanna, an economics and global studies major, kept a blog while on deployment, writing about some incidents he described as “so out of control, it’s hilarious.”</p>\n<p>In one entry, from June 6, 2005, Hanna detailed an ambush on a routine Traffic Control Point mission in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>“We charge across the road and start receiving fire towards our direction,” Hanna wrote. “Wanting to avoid any casualties on our side by having a face-to-face showdown with the guy, someone shouts ‘Who’s got a grenade?’ the LT responds like he just found a prize; ‘I got one’ and tosses it short of the hole! Someone else screams ‘FRAG OUT!! IT’S SHORT IT’S SHORT!!’ and we hit the dirt. Luckily it rolls into the hole and explodes, myself and everyone around me is on their feet charging the trench shooting through the cloud of dust at the enemy… which turned out to be one guy with a rifle!”</p>\n<p>What stands out for Zavala from his time in the Marines are the long days driving convoys across Kuwait and the friendships he made over the nearly eight years he served.</p>\n<p>“One of the great things that the military as an institution provides is that you make great friends from all walks of life,” Zavala said. “That’s one of the things that I miss most, my friends and the friends you make there.”</p>\n<p>Holmes founded SVO at UCSB in 2007 and is currently conducting research on student veterans in higher education. As a Marine, Holmes spent time in Greece and Japan and transferred to UCSB in 2005.</p>\n<p>“The transition can be quite difficult,” he said. “It’s like night and day. … I got here and felt very disconnected.”</p>\n<p><b>Combat to Classroom</b></p>\n<p>While visiting the campus on what he deemed a “recon trip,” Hanna said he appreciated the UCSB lifestyle and the introduction to SVO at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“After I got accepted, I got an email from Quincy welcoming me,” Hanna noted. “Everyone seemed to have an outpouring of support and I was totally ecstatic.”</p>\n<p>Holmes said one of the major reasons he started SVO at UCSB was to provide a place for veterans to feel comfortable on campus.</p>\n<p>“Camaraderie is a big part of the group,” Holmes said. “It’s a support network; a way for people to find others with similar experiences. It’s hard to make friends with the 18-year-old sitting next to you in class.”</p>\n<p>For Holmes and other veterans, revealing their military service can often mean facing difficult situations.</p>\n<p>“The first thing people ask is, ‘Have you killed someone?'” Holmes said. “That’s not an appropriate question. There are guys here that have, and some may not want to talk about it.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Kirsten Gabriel, a psychologist in Counseling Services with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder training, said student veterans’ experiences and backgrounds can vary considerably.</p>\n<p>“They’re not traditional 18-22 students,” she said. “They’re already older. They weren’t just hanging out at home playing video games, they were out on deployment and part of a disciplined and structured environment. They’re coming to a university environment where things are much more fluid, where they don’t wear uniforms and there’s not a rigid time bound structure. … It’s a culture shock in many ways. You’re used to having a gun on you, and it’s a pretty disconcerting feeling not to anymore.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Gabriel, who worked for five years in a Baltimore VA medical center, said veterans face specific issues that other students can’t always understand.</p>\n<p>“In combat, some things once you see, you can’t unsee them,” Dr. Gabriel said. “It can start to become the crisis of, ‘What is the meaning of what I just did over there and the sacrifices people made?’ It can be distressing to people to make sense of what they had done.”</p>\n<p>For many veterans on campus, the student organization offers a way to integrate into the college community.</p>\n<p>“I feel so old sometimes,” Hanna said. “That’s another factor for reintegrating as a vet: As a guy like me, married, 27, I can’t integrate with a lot of the activities here. As a continuing and transfer student, you’re really a fish out of water.”</p>\n<p>While his time in the service was defining, Yamada said, it also means his college experience is tinged with something his peers often don’t share.</p>\n<p>“It feels like I put my life on hold,” he said. “In hindsight, I’m catching up.”</p>\n<p><b>Making the Grade</b></p>\n<p>Along with SVO at UCSB, staff and administrators are currently pushing for a more veteran-friendly campus, particularly through the Veterans Resource Team. The interdisciplinary team aims to offer training for faculty and staff and develop a network of mentors for incoming veterans; last quarter, a member of the VRT, Women’s Center Program Director Jess O’Keefe, also started teaching a class specifically for veterans.</p>\n<p>“The long-range goal is that all students feel comfortable and have resources they need to be successful at UCSB,” Dr. Gabriel said. “They have particular issues and have served their country in ways we have not. We need to honor them and help them be successful.”</p>\n<p>According to Doug Bradley, a lecturer in the Writing Program and a military veteran himself, it is important to remember that dealing with veterans is not a one-size-fits-all deal.</p>\n<p>“Contrary to popular misconceptions, not all returning veterans are quivering bowls of PTSD Jell-O, waiting to emotionally collapse or go berserk,” Bradley wrote in an e-mail. “In fact, most vets are tired of that stereotype. … For that reason, it’s usually best to let veterans talk about their war experiences if and when they are ready. For many of them, that will be never. Students and faculty need to be patient and let vets adapt to civilian life on their own time.”</p>\n<p>Bradley said his homecoming after serving in the Gulf War was vastly different from what many recently discharged soldiers experience.</p>\n<p>“I had orders to remain in theater for eighteen months, but we came home in six,” Bradley wrote. “Can you believe that?! Six months. Compare that with our current veterans, many of whom are coming off their third or fourth tour of duty. … Vets now are coming home to a much quieter, more ambivalent America. The war has stretched on and on, and Americans –while ever loyal and proud of their vets — are having a much harder time figuring out what these two wars mean. Our vets feel the full brunt of that ambivalence as they search for meaning in their own experiences. It’s a long, strange trip.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20261\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-17/fighting-a-new-battle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20261\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-17/fighting-a-new-battle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-17/fighting-a-new-battle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-17/fighting-a-new-battle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-17/fighting-a-new-battle/","id":3545,"author":{"id":337,"name":"Mackenzie Weinger"},"related":[3544,3543,3542],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
