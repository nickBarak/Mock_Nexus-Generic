The 2014 NCAA champions finished the season 43-17, 18-12 in conference to host its fourth straight regional.</p>\n<p>Another possible opponent is No. 4 seeded Xavier who finished the season 30-28, but boasted a strong 14-4 conference record that helped to get them into the tournament.</p>\n<p>Although their record shows an average mark, the Musketeers have won 16 of their last 18, making them the hottest team of this bunch as well as maybe of the entire 64-team roster of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>One of the more interesting things to be seen is how UCSB can fare away from home, especially with traveling all the way to Vanderbilt which is located in Tennessee. Although UCSB only posted a 10-12-1 road record, they picked up the slack a little bit winning three of their final four road games to end the season.</p>\n<p>“So far, it has energized the guys,” Checketts said. “They are so excited to be here and really, for a lot of them, this is their first experience to this. Hopefully that energy stays with us for this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s first round match-up against Washington will be the first meeting of the two teams since 2009 in which UCSB won 8-2 as well as the 15th overall matchup between the two programs’ history, with Santa Barbara holding a slight advantage at 8-6.</p>\n<p>All-Big West First Team pitchers junior Shane Bieber and redshirt sophomore Kyle Nelson will look to stay hot on the mound and keep the scores low to help their team move on to the next round.</p>\n<p>Bieber went 11-3 on the season — the most wins in the Big West — pitched four complete games, had the fifth most strikeouts (91) and the 10th lowest ERA (2.96). Nelson, the star reliever, went 7-2 with eight saves, fifth most in the conference, had the fourth best ERA in the Big West (2.27) and tied for the most strikeouts (73) by a non-starting pitcher in conference.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, UCSB will rely on All-Big West Second Teamers sophomore first baseman Austin Bush and sophomore second baseman J.J. Muno. Bush led the team in home runs (7) and RBI (43) while Muno led the team in hits (57) while ranking second in slugging percentage (.450), home runs (5) and runs (40).</p>\n<p>Other noteworthy players include the four honorable mention players such as sophomore shortstop Clay Fisher who led the team in at-bats (205), redshirt junior Andrew Calica who led the team in on-base percentage (.446), redshirt junior Devon Gradford who led the team in slugging percentage (.469) and senior third baseman Ryan Clark who ranks fifth on the team in batting average (.270).</p>\n<p>On the opposite side, Washington definitely has quality players that it plans on utilizing to get the win. Key players include junior Chris Baker who leads the team in batting average (.325), hits (66), home runs (7), RBI (34) and slugging percentage (.512). Baker is assisted by sophomore infielder Levi Jordan who is second on the team in batting average (.316).</p>\n<p>Similar to the Gauchos, the Huskies also have a solid reliever helping their pitching staff, led by senior right-hander Troy Rallings who currently owns the second best ERA in the entire country with a 0.89 and has earned 16 saves on the season.</p>\n<p>“Washington is a good, solid team and they have a good pitching staff,” Checketts said. “They are solid all around.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB wins Friday’s match-up, then it would face the winner of Vanderbilt/Xavier on Saturday. If they were to lose, then they would face the loser of Vanderbilt/Xavier. In double elimination, once you lose two games, you are out.</p>\n<p>Vanderbilt has two very solid hitters that currently bat over .330 in junior Bryan Reynolds and sophomore Jeren Kendall. Both players started all 60 games and currently have over 50 RBI and both received All-SEC Second Team recognition for their strong season at the plate.</p>\n<p>Xavier’s strengths lie in its ability to hit the ball hard. The Musketeers were first in their conference in slugging percentage (.512) and had the 34th most home runs in the country with 54 long balls. Both senior infielder Andre Jernigan and junior outfielder Joe Gellenbeck have 13 home runs apiece to lead the team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos definitely have a tough road ahead of them this weekend, but this is nothing new for the young baseball team. All year, this team has defied expectations and gone above and beyond, and there is no doubt they will be ready for this Regional.</p>\n<p>Under the current playoff format, Santa Barbara has never made it into the Super Regionals. With its 11th appearance in program history in the Regionals maybe this can be the year it advances to the next round.</p>\n<p>“I think if we come out and play how we want, we are going to win,” Checketts said. “This is a good team and we are ready.”</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against Washington in the first round of the Nashville Regional at Hawkins Field on Friday, June 3 at 12 p.m. PDT.

Last season, Santa Barbara beat USC twice in the regular season but ultimately, the Trojans were the team that knocked the Gauchos out of the Lake Elsinore Regionals.</p>\n<p>Remembering this, UCSB will be motivated to play USC regardless of its slow start to the season. And again it would be smart not to underestimate this team as it does have solid pieces.</p>\n<p>As a team the Trojans are batting a solid .303 from the plate, good enough for fourth in their respective conference. They are also tied for first in home runs as they have hit 15 out of the park this year.</p>\n<p>The offense is carried by many players on this team such as is senior infielder AJ Ramirez who leads the team in RBI (20). Another senior helping lead the charge is outfielder David Oppenheim who leads the team in batting average (.413).</p>\n<p>Pitching wise, the Trojans have struggled boasting a team ERA of 4.26 which ranks seventh in their conference. Pitching for USC Thursday will be right-hander Kyle Davis.</p>\n<p>The senior has struggled a bit this season allowing 36 hits and 17 runs in 35 innings pitched. Davis comes into the Thursday match-up with an overall record of 2-3 on the season as well as a less than stellar 4.37 ERA.</p>\n<p>In order to defeat the opponents that knocked them off last year, the Gauchos will need to continue its hot hitting from Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The best thing about UCSB this season is that everyone on its team can go off at any moment and have a spectacular hitting day. This was the case on Tuesday’s game as redshirt junior Devon Gradford had a great game batting 3-4 (.750) and four RBI.</p>\n<p>Fellow teammate, redshirt sophomore Josh Adams also had a big day batting a perfect 3-3 (.1000) and one RBI while also scoring four runs. Junior shortstop Clay Fisher also helped going 2-4 (.500) with one RBI and two runs scored.</p>\n<p>Pitching for the Gauchos on Tuesday will most likely be right-hander Shane Bieber. The junior has pitched 33 innings this season, most on the team, posting a solid 3.55 ERA and striking out 27 batters leading to his solid 3-1 record.</p>\n<p>Bieber is hot coming into this game as in the last two games he has allowed only one run in 13 innings while also striking out 13 batters.</p>\n<p>This series will be important for the Gauchos. Not only will it be a chance to get some payback for last season, but it would also keep the momentum high.</p>\n<p>UCSB is off to one of the best starts in school history and has shocked many people with its great play. It must stay on track and continue to garner the national attention it deserves so far this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next series is against USC which begins Thursday, March 24 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 3 p.m. Friday’s game will be at the same time and place as Thursday, however, Saturday’s match will be at USC’s home turf, Dedeaux Field, at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

administrators agreed to during the sit-in. The demand states that the university will work with the CSD to document the number of sexual assault incidents in Isla Vista, as well as the number of events centered on sexual assault education.</p>\n<p>CSD President Ethan Bertrand suggested a three-pronged approach that includes using cumulative sexual assault incident statistics from 2016 and 2017, a list of sexual assault services and service providers and an overview of developing programs and ongoing efforts toward combating sexual assault.</p>\n<p>This plan, while deviating from the plan originally suggested by UCSB alumna Ro’Shawndra Earvin during the May 2017 sit-in, still focuses on the “end-all, be-all” goal of the sexual assault report card, but starts instead with a framing of the climate in Isla Vista, CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“We need to have an agreement on what the numbers are before we can go anywhere with the problem, because the I.V. CSD is not going to solve sexual assault in Isla Vista tomorrow,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>While the report card’s completion does not have a set deadline, Brandt said the biweekly meetings will allow community directors to work on the project.</p>\n<p>“It will definitely be made very public once it’s done. I think that we’re still in our preliminary conversations about that, but it looks like it’s one of our staff’s top priorities right now,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>Brandt called the action taken on the sexual assault report card as a “starting point” toward solving the issue of sexual assault in I.V.</p>\n<p>The next steps in addressing this issue involve expansion of the UCSB Community Service Organization Safety Stations, he said.</p>\n<p>“The community trusts [CSOs] more than they trust the police when it comes [to] sharing information, and I think that expanding that would be a good piece of the puzzle that we can play,” Brandt said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Many experienced lung problems from the smoke and ash in the air. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was horrific,” said Darren Schmitt, a 46-year-old homeless local. Schmitt regularly sleeps on a cushion behind Embarcadero Hall, tucked in a corner out of sight of the students passing by.</p>\n<p>When the air quality in I.V. plummeted in the wake of the Thomas Fire, most students fled the neighborhood for their permanent residences. Schmitt stayed on the streets.</p>\n<p>“I watched ash drop all night here,” he said. “Everyone else was wearing [the masks], but I didn’t, so I felt like puking.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, a group of good Samaritans handed him a mask. But Schmitt, uninformed of just how bad the air had gotten, didn’t feel like wearing the mask all day. Believing his mask to not be fully effective, he discarded it.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, volunteer chaplain at the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office, said events like these are far more than unfortunate for the “house-less” of I.V. — they’re life-threatening.</p>\n<p>“You take someone who’s got respiratory problems to begin with — many of them are smokers — and it’s desperation,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>Some of those seeking shelter experienced asthma attacks, coughing and hacking as they finally arrived to an environment with cleaner air.</p>\n<p>Others suffer from lung-related ailments like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or emphysema. Hedges himself felt pain in his lungs, he said, though he had a home to return to.</p>\n<p>Homeless locals are allowed entry to a Warming Center at the University United Methodist Church on Camino Del Sur. Those straying in can receive dinner and blankets.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been doing this for 10 years, serving our community and making sure our friends without a home have a place to go to when it’s cold and wet outside,” said Ed Wesson, operational manager for the Freedom Warming Centers of Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Warming Center opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 6:00 a.m. the next day. At that time, Schmitt said, those who stayed overnight are told to leave, regardless of the weather outside.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s pouring rain,” Schmitt said. “We’re sent out onto the street.”</p>\n<p>In the case of last week’s rainfall, Schmitt escaped to an underground garage in Goleta and hid until the storm cleared.</p>\n<p>“When rain like that comes, we get wet, and all our stuff gets wet,” added another local, who would identify himself only as Jeffrey.</p>\n<p>For decades of living in I.V., Jeffrey has made money by fishing at Goleta Beach and collecting recyclables. Days of heavy rain get in the way of his ability to fish, leaving him with little recourse for money.</p>\n<p>Not all the homeless despaired under the conditions. Another local, who gave his name only as Danny, scoffed at the idea that he was under distress.</p>\n<p>“We live our lives outdoors and fight through everything,” Danny said. “Rain and fire don’t scare me.”</p>\n<p>Each spring, the Central Coast Collaborative on Homeless (C3H) releases an annual census on nationwide homelessness. The 2017 account, published in March, found a population of 26 homeless I.V. locals, the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-17/isla-vista-homeless-population-down-44-percent-since-2013/\">reported</a>. Multiple homeless people said they were suspicious of the figure, agreeing that it felt too low. Hedges refuted the number altogether.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe what happened with that,” Hedges said. “I know the numbers, and the count was just wrong.”</p>\n<p>If census-takers wanted to get an accurate homelessness count, Hedges said, they could attend free dinners served by local churches. When the 2010 census was taken, he rallied homeless people to sign up. If people were to stand up and be counted, Hedges said, it would make for a telling political statement.</p>\n<p>“If you stand up for a census,” he said, “it says, ‘Here I am — you’ve got to count me, I exist. Now deal with me.’”</p>\n<p>If the “powerful” were to know the extent of the problem, he said, there could one day be a difference.</p>\n<p>With the weather cleared, the homeless are free to go about their days on the I.V. streets. Some roam on their bicycles, others hang out at a stone bench on Pardall Road that they’ve dubbed “the bedrock.” Schmitt and Jeffrey sit on the ground at Anisq’Oyo Park and share a jar of peaches. When he reflects on the past month’s trying conditions, Jeffrey is animated but maintains that it doesn’t faze him.</p>\n<p>“We do have a home,” he said, lying horizontally on the ground and tucking his backpack beneath his head. “All of us out here depend on each other.”</p>\n<p>He travels light, but does carry a cardboard sign he likes to show I.V. residents walking by. It boldly reads, “Refuse to have a bad day.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 18 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/i-v-homeless-population-weathers-fire-and-rain/","id":4334,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4333,4332,4331],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
