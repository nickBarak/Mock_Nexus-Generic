Beating Hampton 86-51 last Thursday, Oregon’s win over the Gauchos improved its overall record to 3-0, its best start since 2011.</p>\n<p>The frontcourt combination of forwards senior Jillian Alleyne and redshirt junior Jacinta Vandenberg grabbed 21 of Oregon’s 40 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Alleyne registered her 72<sup>nd</sup> career double-double, finishing with a game-high 15 points and 13 rebounds. She shot 3-6 from the field but scored nine of her 13 at the free throw where she made 9-12. Vandenberg added 14 points on 7-9 shooting to go along with eight boards.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Ducks’ size down low, they were spot on from long distance. Oregon drained 50 percent of its shots from three-point range, making 8-16 beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Oregon’s commitment to the perimeter shot was established early as freshman guard Maite Cazorla scored the Ducks’ first basket of the game, sinking a three-pointer. Her only points in the first quarter, Cazorla tallied half of her game-high 10 assists in the period. Oregon registered 22 assists while UCSB finished with 11.</p>\n<p>The three-point field goal prompted the Ducks’ 14-2 run, signaling they were in route to another lopsided victory. But the Gauchos responded with a 9-0 run of their own as a three-pointer by freshman guard CoCo Miller helped bring UCSB within three at 11-14.</p>\n<p>Miller finished with 10 points on 3-10 shooting, 2-7 from behind the three-point line and added three steals.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s three-point deficit would be the closest it came within Oregon’s lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Still, as Oregon attempted to increase its lead to double figures, the Gauchos continued to chip away at the Ducks’ lead. Trailing 14-21, two quick baskets by senior guard Jasmine Ware helped UCSB to trim Oregon’s lead to 23-18, forcing a Ducks’ timeout.</p>\n<p>Ware finished with a team-high 12 points and tied her career-high of five steals. Her basket with 6:24 remaining turned out to be UCSB’s last before being held scoreless for nearly the next three minutes of the quarter. Oregon’s 6-0 run during the Gauchos’ scoring drought resulted in it taking its first double figure lead at 29-18, causing UCSB to call a timeout.</p>\n<p>A three-pointer by senior point guard Dioseline Lopez at the 3:40 mark ended UCSB’s scoreless streak but wasn’t enough as Oregon held the Gauchos to another scoreless streak to go on an 8-0 run. Ending Santa Barbara’s scoring slump was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe’s three-pointer with 30 seconds remaining in the first half as Oregon entered halftime with a 37-24 lead.</p>\n<p>After combining for 12 points in the second quarter, Oregon’s duo of Alleyne and Vandenberg helped extend the Ducks’ lead in the second half, scoring 11 of the team’s 23 points in the third quarter. Alleyne emerged for seven points, helping Oregon take a 60-43 lead at the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Contributing to Oregon’s 57.4 shooting percentage was senior guard Lexi Petersen. Despite a game-high seven turnovers, she scored 14 points on 6-9 shooting and was 2-4 from long distance.</p>\n<p>Oregon saw a decline in its perimeter shooting in the second and third quarters, going 0-6 from downtown but redeemed itself. It exploded for an 83.3 three-point percentage in the fourth quarter on 5-6 shooting from deep.</p>\n<p>The three-point shooting clinic resulted in the Ducks outscoring UCSB 19-8 in the final quarter. Between the time span of 4:58 through 3:07 remaining in regulation, they knocked down four consecutive three-pointers which led to their 79-51 victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara returns to the Thunderdome this Tuesday, Nov. 24<sup>th</sup> to host University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley at 7:00 p.m. The Vaqueros enter Santa Barbara with an overall record of 3-2. It will be the first time the Gauchos and Vaqueros have ever faced each other.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Both the Gauchos and Roadrunners will be battling for their first wins of the season as CSUB is coming off having its 22-game home winning-streak ended in its 80-74 loss to Pacific last Friday.</p>\n<p>However, the Ducks made a shocking statement in their season opener with an upset victory over North Carolina on the road that knocked the Tar Heels out of their No. 22 ranking to start the year. Now 1-0 overall, the 79-77 triumph even earned Oregon one vote in the AP Top 25 rankings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB hopes to avenge its 74-64 loss to Cal State Bakersfield last season. Despite a career-high 16 points from junior guard Onome Jemerigbe, outshooting the Roadrunners 48.1 percent to 42.9 percent and double figure scoring from two other Gauchos, Santa Barbara still fell short. The Roadrunners shot lights out from three, making 52.4 percent of their long distance attempts to earn the come from behind victory.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for UCSB, former guards Brooklynn Hinkens and Tyonna Outland, the duo that scored 32 of the Roadrunners’ 74 points, are no longer with the program after graduating.</p>\n<p>But the Gauchos will have new concerns with defending senior forward Batabe Zempare. Not much of a scorer, having averaged just 9.5 ppg last season and eight in last year’s meeting against the Gauchos, she tallied 19 points on 52.9 percent shooting in the Roadrunners’ season opener.</p>\n<p>While her role on the team will include more scoring, Zempare is most effective in the paint when crashing the boards. Alongside her 19 points, she also recorded 19 rebounds for her first double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Cal State Bakersfield’s all-time leader in career rebounds entering her senior year with 813, Zempare’s team and conference high of 9.9 rebounds per game last season ranked 38th in the nation. Additionally, she led the WAC and Bakersfield with 14 double-doubles which ranked 27th in the country.</p>\n<p>The Roadrunners’ loss of two veteran guards could be beneficial for the Gauchos and their backcourt of seniors in Jemerigbe and Jasmine Ware, who scored 12 against CSUB last season. Although Ware fouled out late in the game, the two combined shot 12-for-20 from the field.</p>\n<p>Toning down the team’s average of 20 turnovers per game will be most important, especially against Bakersfield, who recorded eight steals against Pacific.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s matchup will be the Gauchos’ second meeting against a Pac-12 opponent this season.</p>\n<p>They face a greater challenge in Oregon, who has proven so far that there is no single strategy to containing their offense.</p>\n<p>The Ducks made 50.8 percent of their shots and were able to upset North Carolina with its tremendous perimeter shooting, making 13-of-29 attempts for a 44.8 three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>Four players scored in double figures in Oregon’s season opener, and leading the way was sophomore guard Lexi Bando. She scored a team-high 18 points, tallying 12 of her points from beyond the arc on 4-for-8 shooting from deep.</p>\n<p>Helping create these opportunities on the perimeter is the Ducks’ length in the paint. Rebounding the ball for Oregon are forwards senior Jillian Alleyne and redshirt junior Jacinta Vandenberg.</p>\n<p>Vandenberg, a transfer from Fresno State, sat out last year as a redshirt and is still finding her role within the Oregon system as she only played 20 minutes in the team’s first game.</p>\n<p>With a double-double of 12 points and 13 rebounds in the upset of North Carolina, Alleyne is the leading force in the Ducks’ frontcourt. Entering this season, she ranked No. 16 in the ESPNW preseason list of top-25 players in the nation.</p>\n<p>Named an AP third-team All-American for the 2014-15 season, her streak of 21 double-doubles from her sophomore through junior seasons, is the third longest in NCAA history and is a Pac-12 and program streak record.</p>\n<p>She also holds single-season records for the conference and program in rebounds (519), double-doubles (29) and her 27 rebounds versus Portland State as a freshman is the most in a game in both Pac-12 and school history.</p>\n<p>Alleyne’s career achievements earned her invitations to the USA junior team camp tryouts in 2013 and World University Games and Pan-Am Games camp in 2015.</p>\n<p>UCSB has been outrebounded 97-75 in its last two games this season. Despite being undersized in the paint, Santa Barbara must find a way to be aggressive with boxing out and outhustling the Ducks for rebounds.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s home opener on Nov. 19th versus CSUB begins at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome. UCSB will travel to Oregon to face the Ducks this Sunday, Nov. 22nd in Matthew Knight Arena at 12:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/ucsb-hosts-cal-state-bakersfield-looking-for-first-win/","id":398,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[397,396,395],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Childress Tips In Game-Winner, UCSB Defeats Nebraska-Omaha 60-59","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Playing without senior Michael Bryson, the Gauchos finish the game on a 9-1 run to come away with a close win in their first game of the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66481\" style=\"width: 195px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1809710560\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66506\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66481\" data-attachment-id=\"66481\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/john-green-drives-toward-the-hoop-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLuo-03-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 6D\",\"caption\":\"John Green drives toward the hoop.

The basket was Childress’s only one on the night, capping off a 9-1 run over the final 4:19 to give the Gauchos a 60-59 win.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara earned the victory despite playing without senior guard Michael Bryson, the team’s leading returning scorer and rebounder from last season, who was suspended for one game by the NCAA for playing in an unsanctioned summer league game in July.</p>\n<p>Shouldering the load in Bryson’s place was senior guard John Green, who led the way with game-highs of 22 points and 13 rebounds. However, with Green fouling out with 3:54 left to play, Childress and sophomore point guard Gabe Vincent took over to bring UCSB back.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a close first half, the Mavericks finally took control thanks to a 25-4 run in the second half to put them up 58-51.</p>\n<p>With his team down by seven with less than five minutes to go, Vincent knocked down a deep three just 25 seconds prior to Green fouling out. Childress followed that up by knocking down two clutch free throws at the 3:02 mark to cut the lead to 58-56.</p>\n<p>Omaha’s Tre’Shawn Thurman went 1-for-2 at the line with 1:36 left to go, leading to a pretty driving score by Vincent just eight seconds later to make it a one point game at 59-58.</p>\n<p>A pair of missed three-point attempts by the Mavericks gave the Gauchos possession with 38 seconds left. After deciding not to call for a timeout, UCSB freshman Justin Burks failed to connect on a three with 22 ticks to go. Childress was able to rise up and tip the ball out to senior guard T.J. Taylor in the corner, leading to a Gaucho timeout with 12 seconds left.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Mitch Brewe received a pass from Vincent and put up a shot with four seconds left that rimmed out, but Childress was there for the put back and Omaha was unable to get off a final shot.</p>\n<p>It was a poor shooting night for both teams, as the Gauchos finished shooting just 34.9 percent (22-63 FG) and the Mavericks not much better at 34.7 percent (17-49). UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams was surprised to come away with the win given his team’s 20 turnovers compared to just 10 assists, but the Gauchos were helped out by Omaha’s similar mark of 19 TOs and 10 assists.</p>\n<p>Brewe finished with nine points and five rebounds off the bench on a solid 4-5 shooting night. Senior guard DaJuan Smith reeled in a career-high eight rebounds, including four on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Omaha had three players score in double figures, including Thurman with a near double-double at 10 points, nine rebounds, and Randy Reed, who recorded 14 points and eight rebounds while going a perfect 8-8 from the line.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be back in action tonight on the road against Cal with tip-off set for 7 p.m. at Haas Pavilion. The Golden Bears came into the season ranked No. 14 in the nation and defeated Rice 97-65 in their season-opener as five different players scored in double figures.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/childress-tips-in-game-winner-ucsb-defeats-nebraska-omaha-60-59/","id":399,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[398,397,396],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall at No. 15 Cal, Open Home Schedule Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLu0-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MBasketballVS.SFSU-20151108-JennyLu0-03-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Despite 23 points from senior guard Michael Bryson, the UCSB men's basketball team was unable to contain the dynamic offense of No. 15 Cal in its 85-67 loss on Monday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A 13-2 deficit to open the game set the tone for the UCSB men’s basketball team on Monday as it fell 85-67 at No. 15 Cal.

The Golden Bears are 2-0 after picking up their second straight blowout victory to open the season, outscoring their opponents by an average of 25 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We have a tough preseason schedule every year. It’s all about building,” sophomore guard Gabe Vincent said. “We played a much better game than we did at UNO and now we’re looking to play better than we did at Cal. There’s a lot of things we’ve got to work on and shooting might be one piece but we have a lot defensively to work on as well.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off a season-opener in which UCSB shot just 34.9 percent from the field, things weren’t much better to open the game at Cal as the Gauchos missed their first seven shots before center Ami Lakoju’s got them on the board at the 14:38 mark, already trailing 8-0 prior to the freshman’s layup.</p>\n<p>Berkeley’s junior guard Jordan Mathews came out hot, knocking down a pair of triples and converting a three-point play during the Bears 13-2 run to open the game. He went on to finish with 16 points and seven rebounds while going 3-6 from deep and 6-9 from the field.</p>\n<p>From there, senior guard Tyrone Wallace took over as he led Cal with a 15-point first half, including 8-9 shooting from the free throw line to give his team a 47-28 lead heading into the break. The Bears shot 50 percent in the half compared to just 32.3 percent for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior guard John Green was miscredited with a third personal foul in the first stanza, causing him to play only nine minutes before the foul was reversed in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a much better effort in the final 20 minutes, outscoring Berkeley 39-38 on 14-29 shooting as a team, but the end result was never in question.</p>\n<p>One bright spot for UCSB was the play of senior guard Michael Bryson, who played his first game of the season. The Gauchos’ leading returning scorer and rebounder scored 23 points on 8-18 from the field and an impressive 4-8 from three to lead his team on offense.</p>\n<p>Wallace finished with game-highs of 24 points and six assists on an efficient 6-10 shooting night and 11-13 from the line to lead Cal. Freshman forward Jaylen Brown scored in double-digits for the second consecutive game, recording 17 points to go along with seven boards.</p>\n<p>UCSB now shifts its focus to Saturday’s game against Oregon State. With two impressive 20-point wins in their first two games, the Beavers are currently 2-0 and will play Rice later tonight.</p>\n<p>“We need to get stops,” Vincent said. “The more we can keep them out of the paint and off the free throw line like the other two teams we’ve played have been, the better off we’ll be and we can get out, run more and get more possessions.”</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Drew Eubanks has shot a remarkable 13-15 from the field through his first two career NCAA games, averaging a team-high 16 points a night. The Beavers have a total of five players averaging double-figures to start the year, including two off the bench, and are shooting a solid 49.6 percent as a team.</p>\n<p>Reigning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton II, son of NBA great Gary Payton, is another player shooting lights out at 55 percent. He averages 14 points and a team-leading 5.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to handle them just like we do everybody else,” Vincent said. “We’re going to play them straight up, keep them off the line and keep them out of the paint, make them shoot over us instead of around us.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, John Green has continued to show his growth coming off his first full season without missing significant time due to injury. He is currently second on the team averaging 17 points a night but has also been extremely helpful on the boards, pulling in a team-best nine per outing.</p>\n<p>Vincent is the team’s third leading-scorer at 10.4 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ first home game of the season will be played early at 2 p.m. this Saturday against Oregon State in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 19, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66600\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66600\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/gauchos-fall-at-no-15-cal-open-home-schedule-saturday/","id":400,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[399,398,397],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
