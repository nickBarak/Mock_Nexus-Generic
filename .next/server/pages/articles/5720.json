At first, I was shocked. Although I knew what I was getting myself into when I announced my candidacy for EVPLA in yet another Associated Students election this past week, I did not expect the drama to get this toxic, or this personal. My brother attempted to make light of the situation: “Now you know what it’s like to have #haters,” he joked. But I couldn’t keep myself from refreshing the page, reading over and over again the dehumanizing words about my identity and experiences, looking through the profiles of the strangers who seemed to know me without ever trying. As I read lies and rumors about myself and my peers, the numbing ache in my stomach grew, but I was unable to tear my eyes away. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not like I’ve never received any sort of backlash before. As an outspoken advocate for my community, and someone who’s been “through the wringer” in Associated Students at UCSB, I’ve certainly experienced and witnessed more than my fair share of toxicity and (usually indirect) harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am the daughter of Iranian immigrants. My parents and most of my family, like thousands of others, left Iran for fear of being persecuted as part of a Jewish minority when the Islamic regime violently came to power. I’m also white-passing, and I have publicly acknowledged the immense privilege I carry because of that. I deeply understand the harmful potentials of equating my experiences with those of other brown folks, experiences I will never truly know myself. I am a first-generation college student. English was my second language. The most common question I’m asked is, “Persian Jews exist?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There. Now you know a little bit more about me ー more than the author of that tweet does, and likely more than the people behind the 50+ anonymous comments left on my </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/lea-toubian-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus endorsement article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I do not need to justify or be performative about my lived experiences to appease those who want to doubt, discredit and invalidate me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These things are all essential parts of my identity. They are all valid. They are not up for debate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They will not be erased. I will not be erased.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years, Jewish students have been speaking out about anti-Semitism and our experiences on this campus. Yet in my experience, we are often harassed, bullied and excluded from progressive spaces on campus for our beliefs. The author of the tweet does not know me and yet felt like it was appropriate to erase and dismiss every single thing about me. In their eyes, nothing — not my years of dedication to progressive causes, my personal experiences or struggles or any of the work I have done on this campus — none of that is valid because of their preconceived notions of who I am. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it’s the anonymous comments; or that at last year’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/a-s-senate-votes-against-divestment-through-secret-ballot/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divestment resolution hearing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a former A.S. Senate candidate stated that “Jewish students shouldn’t have as much power as they do on this campus”; or that a current candidate alluded to age-old anti-Semitic tropes in their </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2020/#TransferSenator\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus questionnaire response</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by implying that pro-Israel students “truly own the school,” harm against our community continues to be brushed under the rug.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am being targeted because I am a public figure at this school. I am not afraid to speak my truth about issues that are important to me, and I am putting myself out there to run this campaign. I knew that displaying vulnerability would open the door for attacks on my character. However, the rest of my community, those who do not run for office or are hesitant to express themselves and those who just simply want to be accepted members of the student body, are just as affected by incidents like this. They witness this rhetoric and are made to feel fearful of their peers. Which is exactly the objective: People like this want us to be scared. They want to silence us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today’s society, it’s increasingly easy to pick a side hyper-fast and stick to it. To reference a saying I heard recently, conversation has become either meaningless or impossible. We embolden ourselves within the comfort of our self-constructed echo chambers, “cancelling” anyone or anything that would make us question our ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To my peers in A.S.: Why do you think the student body is fed up with us? When Senate meetings run for hours, Daily Nexus articles are flooded with anonymous comments full of slurs and baseless accusations and social media feeds are cluttered with ruthless campaigning and (not-so) subtle jabs at competitors, their faith in our ability to serve them dwindles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve turned into a reality show. At best, we’re the laughing stock of this campus; at worst, a waste of student fees. And when it comes to supporting our friends when it’s their turn to take the stage, we tear each other down. When elections come around, some of the most vocal people in our organization, who promise to uplift marginalized communities and uphold progressive values, are the ones who engage in this harmful behavior, stripping people of their complexities in their attempt to make them fit into their binary definitions of “good” or “bad.” Instead of fairly criticizing platform points and ideals, this has become a competition of whose identity is the most valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we expend so much energy fighting each other, we distract and become distracted from the fights that really matter — our graduate students are calling on us to support them, our balconies are collapsing while our landlords stay silent and the lawsuits against our UCPD are still stalled. Where is our solidarity?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are these the hands we want to leave the fate of our campus in? Will these be the people to create tangible change at UCSB, or will A.S. revert to its divisive, unproductive ways? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the UCSB student body: You each pay over $600 to Associated Students. It is my hope that you will elect honest, focused and principled leaders who are capable of this responsibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s up to you, Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lea Toubian is disappointed that students are tearing each other down during this already difficult time and hopes we can start to treat each other with respect. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94040\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-18/letter-to-the-editor-divisiveness-will-not-elect-a-stronger-a-s/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94040\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-18/letter-to-the-editor-divisiveness-will-not-elect-a-stronger-a-s/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-18/letter-to-the-editor-divisiveness-will-not-elect-a-stronger-a-s/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-18/letter-to-the-editor-divisiveness-will-not-elect-a-stronger-a-s/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-18/letter-to-the-editor-divisiveness-will-not-elect-a-stronger-a-s/","id":5720,"author":{"id":807,"name":"Lea Toubian"},"related":[5719,5718,5717],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":807,"name":"Lea Toubian","biography":"Not available","articles":[5720],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Students Speak Out On Coronavirus","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2020-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students share their perspectives on coronavirus, the global health emergency.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent outbreak of coronavirus, a respiratory infection which has spread from Wuhan, China to over 25 other countries, has taken the lives of more than 2,000 people to date.

This boosts the spread of the disease</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As a result, there is a great deal of criticism toward Chinese people, as they are being blamed for bringing the virus into new countries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My friend admitted that she has been upset by certain interactions on our own campus. Even though she returned to school in early January, when the disease had just begun to spread, her family and friends are still in Wuhan. “There is nothing I can do, except tell them to wear masks,” she recalled. She said she feels helpless and is deeply concerned for her family and friends. The harmful comments that she has observed on the news and social media posts have depressed her further. The news blames people from Wuhan for consuming exotic animals and traveling during this time period. </span>My friend feels disappointed when she notices the people around her acting extremely cautious, as if she herself is some kind of virus<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“Society should be geared toward an environment where race is not the primary criteria to judge one another.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It hurts,” my friend confessed. “People should not generalize and attribute the virus to the whole Chinese population.” She pointed out that “there are restaurants refusing to allow Chinese people in.” While it is true that the disease originated from China, extrapolating this to all Chinese people is not a productive reaction. </span>“Society should be geared toward an environment where race is not the primary criteria to judge one another,”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was both surprised by and sympathetic to what my friend from Wuhan has encountered. The response of unfair overgeneralization hurts people’s feelings. As a Chinese student myself, this is especially disheartening to hear about. Next time you meet an international student, throw away the stereotypes and maybe take a moment to learn about who they really are. If they are a Chinese student from Wuhan, ask them, “How are your parents? Is your family doing okay?” or simply respond with a hug. That would be sweet. I hope our world can become better with a little respect and a lot of empathy, because sometimes a little consideration goes a long way. </span></p>\n<p><em>– Jessica Kuo</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara students should not be overly paranoid about coronavirus spreading to our campus. First of all, since the disease originated in China, the only way for the virus to get to Santa Barbara would be from a community member traveling to and from China. As most UCSB faculty and students returned from winter break before the virus was discovered, we are not at high risk of contraction. Santa Barbara doesn’t have an international airport and it isn’t an overly popular tourist city. There is very little chance that the citizens here have been exposed to the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/18/world/18reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most airlines have recently canceled flights</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> between China and other countries. The federal government has also </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2020/02/05/travel-restrictions-tied-coronavirus-stall-travel-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enacted a new policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stating that all tourists from China must be quarantined and observed for 14 days, which is the extent of the incubation period of the virus, before they can leave and go about their business. The last two cases in California have been confined and quarantined to hospitals. The virus is still far away from us. It is an overreaction to ask for our campus to be shut down.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students who are healthy, please respect those who are sick or wearing masks.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the chances of exposure to coronavirus are very low, we cannot presume our community is a completely safe zone. Along with coronavirus, there are also several kinds of influenza circulating in the U.S. Students should wear masks to protect themselves from catching the flu from public areas, especially in crowded places, such as the library or large lecture halls. Since some symptoms of these flus are similar to the coronavirus infection, people who have a fever, cough and breathing difficulties should visit Student Health and receive a diagnosis for their illness. After that, they should avoid going to crowded places or talking to other people without a mask because the flu is also highly contagious.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, for students who are healthy, please respect those who are sick or wearing masks. All we mask-wearers want to do is keep viruses and disease from spreading. Please do not laugh at people wearing masks or insult them for doing so. Be friendly and sympathetic and let hope fill our campus.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Hondong Huang</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Chinese international student who wants to pursue a career in health, I have to raise my voice: The epidemic is not an excuse to be racist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am fortunate to have not yet personally experienced any racial prejudice at UC Santa Barbara. However, my best friend, who studies at Emerson College in Boston, was verbally assaulted by a couple of strangers because she is Asian and wore a mask. Also, some of my non-Chinese friends have told me that their parents have advised them to stay away from Chinese people. I was shocked and saddened to hear that people would start to blame and fear an entire ethnicity during this health emergency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these people fail to realize that the Chinese are just as afraid as everyone else — or possibly even more afraid. We are scared and sad because our friends, families and the cities we were raised in are struggling during this catastrophe. Right now, it’s the Lunar New Year, which is the equivalent of the winter holidays for Western cultures, the time of year for family reunions and to spread love and support. However, this year people are quarantined, separated and facing discrimination. The social stigma against Chinese people is growing worse, and when people are quick to blame, fewer are inclined to help.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a battle between </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> humans and the coronavirus. China is just the first victim.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chinese are not a public threat; the virus and those exposed to the outbreak are. This is not an issue of ethnicity, religion, physical appearance, gender, geography or nationality. This is simple science: it’s about a virus spreading among humans and affecting people’s health. This is a battle between </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> humans and the coronavirus. China is just the first victim. Racial prejudice born of this epidemic isolates Chinese people, causing whoever is experiencing symptoms to hide their illness, contributing further to the public health crisis. So stop blaming an entire segment of the population and instead help protect our community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information about the evolving coronavirus epidemic is being clearly and effectively conveyed to the public. As a part of this community, it’s our responsibility to get information from reliable sources and stop panicking. Don’t hate or judge people of Chinese ethnicity. Keep up with the news, focus on the facts and advocate for public health to actively protect our community.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Enjia Zhang</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wuhan is known to have a large exotic meat market, which is why the virus is thought to have originated from one of the animals sold at the market. It was originally thought that the virus could only be spread from direct contact with an infected animal. However, as more information about coronavirus comes to light, researchers have concluded that this disease can also spread from human contact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As densely populated areas, Isla Vista and the UC Santa Barbara campus are prime locations for diseases to spread; coronavirus is no exception. However, there is a lot of false information circulating in the media, giving rise to unnecessary panic. It is crucial that the UCSB community stays up to date with accurate information about the virus in order to remain safe and healthy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coronavirus is primarily transmitted through person-to-person contact. It is still unclear whether or not the virus can be passed through touch, such as by touching a surface that an infected person has also touched. Because of the nature of the disease, it is very important to wash your hands thoroughly and often — especially before and after coming into contact with your face, eyes or nose.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a lot of false information circulating in the media, giving rise to unnecessary panic.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another crucial step that UCSB students can take to prevent the spread of this virus is staying home when they are sick and avoiding close contact with others who are sick with any illness. If the sickness persists, it is imperative to visit a doctor. While the odds of contracting coronavirus in this area are extremely low, early diagnosis can be key in disease prevention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that the measures that should be taken to prevent a possible case of coronavirus are essentially the same measures that should be taken to avoid any common contagious virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get the most up-to-date information, UCSB students should consult credible websites such as that of the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Center for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or speak with their local health care providers. If the public is well-informed and aware of the symptoms and proper preventative measures, it will be easier for health care providers to treat and contain the virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, there has been much unnecessary hysteria surrounding the outbreak of this disease. To avoid this, well-informed students should pass along reliable information to others. It is important for the community to be educated in order to keep everyone well versed on the nature of the virus. We should encourage friends and peers to watch out for signs and symptoms while simultaneously keeping in mind that these symptoms could be — and most likely are — indicative of any number of viruses. We must also encourage our community members to maintain healthy living habits, such as washing hands and keeping clean living spaces. In doing so, the UCSB community can remain safe and educated on the outbreak of this world health epidemic.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Maya Wohl</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My homeland is severely suffering from coronavirus. People are forced to stay in their homes and are in great danger. As the virus is still being researched, experts and scientists are not yet certain of the modes of transmission or effective treatments. Thus, people must take up their own efforts to defend themselves against it. Many families and individuals in China are now struggling against the fatal virus, including family members of international students here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we are studying in a foreign country, our minds are consumed with our home country. It is extremely distressing to see that our prosperous hometowns are now empty cities, and many factories and schools are being transformed into temporary hospitals. To help our country get through this difficult time, international students have tried our best to transport medical supplies back to China. Among these supplies, masks and protective suits are most important for avoiding further infection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the UCSB campus, the prevalence of mask-wearing has recently led to an increased amount of discrimination. Although I have never personally experienced this, I have witnessed and read about plenty of racist attacks around the world against Chinese people. We want people to know that most of us never lived in the city where the virus originated and that most of us have not been back to China since the outbreak began. We have had no contact with the virus, so there is no reason for Chinese students to be ostracized. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some western media sources have named the virus “yellow peril,” which is blatant racism.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though coronavirus originated in China, Chinese people should not be labeled as ill or contaminated. Coronavirus is a catastrophe for all human beings, not only Chinese people. Mankind must stick together to persist through collective difficulty. Just like Ebola and -CoV, coronavirus is not anyone’s fault — including those who have been infected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2009, thousands of people were infected by H1N1, or swine flu, a widespread flu which originated in Mexico. However, no one blamed a certain country or race for that pandemic. Though China is working tirelessly to fight against coronavirus and minimize the global death toll, some western media sources have named the virus “yellow peril,” which is blatant racism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chinese students are wearing face masks as a protective measure, because we don’t want to be infected by other people. We are not sick.  I hope the racist behaviors will stop and we can avoid imposing further psychological harm to Chinese students.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Liuyi Chen</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Don’t look at me like I am some kind of freak!” This is what I want to tell the xenophobic students at UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the outbreak of coronavirus, all Chinese students have been put on high alert: many of them started to wear face masks in order to minimize chances of infection. Some people on campus who may not be aware of the seriousness of the situation seem bothered by Chinese students wearing masks. Holly Smith, an administrative nursing supervisor and infection control coordinator at UCSB, suggested that there is no need for those who have not been infected by the virus to wear masks. Yet, the incubation period, the contagious stage of the virus, can last up to 14 days. The purpose of wearing masks is simply to protect one another from the risk of getting infected. Although there are no confirmed cases at UCSB, it is still necessary to implement preventative methods.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should acknowledge the function of facial masks in preventing the spread of any disease.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the chance of an outbreak in Santa Barbara is extremely low, Chinese students are not willing to take any chances. I sincerely ask UCSB students to stop being xenophobic toward the virus. We should acknowledge the function of facial masks in preventing the spread of any disease. It is indecent for people to discriminate against any racial group, especially during such a sensitive time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultural differences also account for this misguided attitude toward mask-wearing. Unlike in western cultures, mask-wearing is a common method of illness prevention in China and other Asian countries. Not only do we wear masks during flu season, we also put on face masks whenever we are sick to stop an illness from spreading further. Face masks certainly do a better job of this than sneezing and coughing into an elbow. And for those who are not sick, masks can diminish the chances of becoming infected.        </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am really sorry that students wearing masks on campus is causing some people to panic. I hope that other students will educate themselves about the benefits of face masks and the good intentions of Chinese students who wear them. We do this not only for our own health, but also for the protection of the people around us.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Hao Gong</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

insight into her life and her plans for the future.</p>\n<p>Bender is a bonafide superstar in the sport of track and field, breaking and owning countless school records that rival those of Barbara Nwaba, a former UCSB student and current Olympian.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago Bender competed in the Big West Multi Championships and retained her crown as the heptathlon champion, winning the title back-to-back. She continued her dominance last weekend during the Conference Championships and proceeded to place a new record in the long jump with a whopping distance of 6.29 meters, to go alongside her mind-boggling 400-meter hurdle time of 56.64 seconds that destroyed both the school record and conference record. Bender’s performance was unlike any other, and her continued excellence in the sport earned her a second consecutive Big West Women’s Athlete of the Meet honor.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>LP: Hi Hope! On behalf of the Nexus, thank you again for granting us an interview. Do you mind telling the readers your full name, age, year and major?</strong></p>\n<p>HB: Not a problem! My name is Hope Bender, I’m a 22-year-old senior at UCSB and I’m a biology major.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: How did you decide to do track, and how long have you been involved in the sport?</strong></p>\n<p>HP: I started track my freshman year of high school, but I started taking it seriously my junior year so it’s been about six years. My mom did track, which was the reason as to why I started. In high school, I started out in the 200-meter and 400 -meter sprints, but focused more on the 100-meter and 300 -meter hurdles my senior year.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: Did it feel like it came naturally to you?</strong></p>\n<p>HB: Events like the hurdles, running events and shot put came pretty naturally, but the jumps — especially the high jump — and the javelin I’m still trying to get the hang of.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: Why the heptathlon?</strong></p>\n<p>HB: I chose it because I wanted to do a bit of everything. I didn’t want to focus on just one event, because I thought that might get old after a little while. I had a club coach that encouraged me to look into the heptathlon, and he taught me how to do hurdles and the other events.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: How different is it to train for the heptathlon?</strong></p>\n<p>HB: The amount of time it takes is the biggest difference. We spend more hours on the track because we have so many different things to focus on. We only have so much time with each of the events. We can’t spend hours on a single event, so we have to spread our time out evenly.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: Given that you only started participating in the heptathlon your freshman year at UCSB, how does it feel to become a back-to-back champion?</strong></p>\n<p>HB: It’s pretty cool! My first two years were definitely my big learning years, and just learning how to get comfortable, grow and getting a good foundation in the events. The past two years have been fun and not have to focus on just getting a mark on an event, but getting to challenge each event — making sure I’m competitive and getting good results across the board. Being back-to-back champ has been a ton of fun, and it means more that I got to finish out at home and that the last conference meet was here.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: So … congratulations on being a back-to-back champ, and also congratulations on breaking even more school records this past weekend. With that in mind, what record do you want to break next and why?</strong></p>\n<p>HB: Thank you! The next one I want is the heptathlon school record. It’s currently held by Barbara Nwaba. She went to the Olympics in 2016 and finished second in the NCAA championships her senior year. She’s incredible and has been a friend and a mentor to me, so I’m looking forward to giving it one more shot in the NCAAs.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: How intense has training and nutrition gotten now that you’re prepping for nationals?</strong></p>\n<p>HB: Everything is about being strong and fast, and more about peaking. We’re making sure my eating and nutrition is dialed in. Practices are shorter, but more intense. Everything is about making sure we’re mentally, emotionally and physically ready for Austin.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: What are your goals for the year, and what results would you be happy with?</strong></p>\n<p>HB: I brought up the heptathlon school record, and I want to achieve 6,000 points in it. It’s kind of a barrier that separates good from great. I would hate to put a number or place on what I’d be happy with, but just going out and not having a bad event, being consistent across the board and maybe getting a couple individual event PRs to boost my scores to where I want to be.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: As a senior, this would be your final year as a student-athlete. Where would you want to go after your graduation?</strong></p>\n<p>HB: Just looking forward one year, I want to compete in the 2020 Olympic trials next June, so I’m planning to give track at least one more year and give it a good run. I’ll never be able to do it again, so I might as well. After that, I’d love to get my MBA and work on the business side of the biotech industry.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: Any final words, messages or shoutouts to our readers?</strong></p>\n<p>HB: Shoutout to Coach Horn, Coach Marlow and Coach Schmitt. Shoutout to my teammates. I was so impressed by every single one of them and how they carried themselves during the races. Everyone did better than expected. As a final message, the biggest thing I learned from track and field is that there’s always going to be good times and hard times, but it’s important to have people who believe in you even when you don’t. That support pushed me to be who I am today.</p>\n<p><strong>LP: Thank you again for the interview, and good luck in nationals!</strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/leonard-paulasa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Leonard Paulasa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Staff writer and photographer.

I cannot agree more. The infrastructure of UCSB’s online learning experience compared to that of the local community colleges, or even local high schools, has been inferior.

The rush to adopt Zoom meetings has forced faculty to implement software they are poorly equipped to manage. Additionally, there is significantly better educational software than Zoom available. When we attend the best public university system in California, with UCSB posturing itself as a cutting-edge, research-based university, the planning, adoption and addition of online education should have been anticipated years ago. </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-12/usc-ucla-coronavirus-online-classes-transition\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Los Angeles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has made a much smoother emergency transition as they have been answering the need for online classes since 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the bounds of a research university, connection should be the emphasis. Students that are now practicing social distancing are also feeling isolated from their academic community. The general feeling of faculty disarray is communicated through chaotic Zoom lectures and the numerous conflicting emails subsequently raising student anxiety levels. It is clear that the faculty were not supported enough prior to the start of spring quarter to prepare and alter their lesson plans.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB experience is one that <a href=\"https://www.ucsb.edu/about\">aspires to deliver</a> a “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dynamic environment that prizes academic inquiry and interpersonal connection to inspire scholarly ambition, creativity, and discoveries with wide-ranging impact</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” When students are met with broken links, overloaded systems and deliverables that are disjointed and confusing, you should expect us to ask why and demand better of you. We deserve an explanation. Seven thousand (and counting) people are demanding compensation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the system stands now, already possessing our spring tuition fees and with grades nine weeks away, how do you — UC Santa Barbara — rise to the occasion and provide us with the educational experience we have earned? </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terra Paige is a senior English major with two sons, 15 and 19.
