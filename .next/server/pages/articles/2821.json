Melgoza claims she was repeatedly silenced and mistreated by Judicial Affairs staff, with her assailant receiving a suspension for two academic quarters and set to return to UCSB this upcoming fall quarter to continue his studies.</p>\n<p>Amidst protesters’ loud chanting, Melgoza said she was discouraged by Judicial Affairs when she reported she was sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p>“I was raped in my dorm on January 18, 2014,” Melgoza said. “I ended up sitting down with a Judicial Affairs officer and unfortunately she discouraged me greatly. She said there was not enough evidence — that it might be a long and arduous process, implying that I would never win.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If I cheat on a test, I am going to get suspended on the spot. But if I violate someone else’s body, that is not seen as something serious and the consequences are for a lifetime. – Alejandra Melgoza</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Melgoza, universities across the country are failing to properly address reports of sexual assault and provide support to survivors.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t stay silent because it’s such a huge problem,” Melgoza said. “Universities across the nation are protesting this because people are angry that such a horrible violent crime is not being treated seriously. If I cheat on a test, I am going to get suspended on the spot. But if I violate someone else’s body, that is not seen as something serious and the consequences are for a lifetime.”</p>\n<p>The university has released a statement on the matter, refusing to comment on the individual case but affirming the services available for students experiencing sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“In order to protect the privacy of individuals, and to encourage future reporting of cases, we do not discuss details of individual cases. The University provides individuals with confidential advocacy services through CARE, our Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p>The university also affirmed its adherence to UC policy and state and federal law.</p>\n<p>“We have a thorough student conduct process that we recently strengthened by moving sexual assault investigations to our Title IX office in accordance with UC policy and government guidelines. We take concerns raised by our students extremely seriously and as such we look forward to having an opportunity to meet with our students involved in today’s action to continue to discuss their concerns in detail.”</p>\n<p>Protesters called for UCSB administration and the UC system to restructure sexual assault policies and sanctions to allow for harsher repercussions for sexual assaulters and improved support for survivors. With these changes, protesters hope to eliminate the culture of silence surrounding the issue of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Kelty Kauffman, third-year feminist studies and English double major and co-chair of Take Back the Night, a student committee working with sexual assault survivors and advocates for the prevention of sexual assault, said the current sexual assault policies limit the university’s ability to properly discipline sexual assault perpetrators.</p>\n<p>“The only things the university can do are suspensions, expulsions and bans from campus — none of which they do very well,” Kauffman said. “I’ve personally never heard of anyone getting expelled for sexual assault. The maximum consequence for people who are found guilty of sexual assault is a two quarter suspension.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62371\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62371\" data-attachment-id=\"62371\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/students-protest-alleged-mistreatment/sit-in-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428935647\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"58\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TBTN Sit In\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62371\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62371\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Kauffman, staffers of the university’s existing support system for survivors are not properly trained and should be more accommodating to those who have been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p>“There is just consistent mishandling — the people who work in these spaces like the Judicial Affairs Office are obviously aren’t trained on how to talk or work with survivors,” said Kauffman. “When you’re going through a process that takes over a year and you’re constantly asked things that trigger you to think about something painful, that’s a big deal.”</p>\n<p>According to Tanya Cortez, a friend of Melgoza and second-year math major, when Melgoza went to pursue the case, Judicial Affairs allegedly reported no longer having evidence of the case.</p>\n<p>“Her perpetrator left for personal reasons and when he came back, that’s when she felt very uncomfortable,” Cortez said. “She went again to pursue it … and they had like no records of their case. She had already reported [the crime] in spring, and they had no idea where this case was.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the end of the day, life doesn’t stop. – Alejandra Melgoza</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Marlene Alcantar was among the line of students holding giant signs to protest the mistreatment of survivors and said change needs to be implemented across all UC campuses regarding sexual assault policy.</p>\n<p>“I’m here to support Alejandra but also any other survivor that the system has not given justice to,” Alcantar said. “I wish the system was not so lax.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said every survivor goes through different experiences and must do what is comfortable for them to move past their experience.</p>\n<p>“Finding a way to empower yourself is the best way to make this happen; for example, I just released myself to social media,” Melgoza said. “At the end of the day, life doesn’t stop. I want to make sure that these policies are enforced so I can keep moving on with my life and reach my goals.”</p>\n<p>[Update: A previous version of this article state the university did not return requests for comment.

Senators listen to funding requests from student organizations. <em>Alexander Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met yesterday in the State Street Room in the University Center to hear funds requests from eight student organizations.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to partially fund one organization, table two requests indefinitely, recommend one organization to seek funding from senate and not fund four requests. They started the meeting with $12,009 in the culture weeks and graduation fund, $3,196 in the senate unallocated fund, and zero dollars in all other funds including the sports teams, OSL and Student Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP) funds.</p>\n<p>The Committee indefinitely tabled decisions on the Geography Club, which requested $260, and the Pacific Island Student Association, which requested $5228, because their representatives were not present.</p>\n<p>Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educacion y Revolucion (M.U.J.E.R.), an advocacy group for Chicana and Latina students, requested $3,006.60 for the food and venue for their annual MUJERcitas conference, which has brought in around 150 high school girls each of the past three years.</p>\n<p>Committee chairman and third-year history of public policy Jimmy Villarreal said the committee had to deny M.U.J.E.R. of all funding, because their request would come out of SIOP.</p>\n<p>UCSB Cycling Team president Richard Lo requested $1,000 from Finance Board to offset the cost of airfare to road nationals, as the team has been unable to get funding from other sources.</p>\n<p>“We are looking to send four men and three women to road nationals in May,” Lo said. “We have already looked at rec sports and other external funding, but we haven’t gotten any.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said the committee had no money to grant the team.</p>\n<p>“We are zeroed out of our sports funds, but we will discuss if we can find any other source,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>The Film Studio requested $500 for purchasing food, a red carpet and rental of I.V. Theater for their upcoming annual festival.</p>\n<p>“We are currently organizing our fifth annual Santa Barbara Digital Film Festival,” the representative said. “The event is open to the entire campus. Anyone can submit.”</p>\n<p>The committee motioned to deny the Studio all requested funds and suggest they take their request to senate.</p>\n<p>The Pink Research Link, which encourages UCSB students to take interest in breast cancer research, requested $75 to help recruit new members using flyers.</p>\n<p>“It is already a small club, and it is mostly made up of the officers, which are either graduating or studying abroad next year,” the representative said. “We are really looking to recruit new students, because recently we have made a lot of progress in what we have been able to do for breast cancer awareness.”</p>\n<p>The committee denied the club’s request, but committee advisor Cindy Lopez suggested they request the $250 startup, which they would be guaranteed to receive if they meet the basic criteria.</p>\n<p>The Japanese Language Café (JLC) requested $280 for food and drinks for their quarterly potluck and karaoke party, which is historically their biggest event, but the committee denied their request.</p>\n<p>According to Villarreal, the committee’s shrinking budget restricted all of their decisions.</p>\n<p>“We are getting toward the end of the year, so we’re low on funds now,” Villarreal said. “We allocated them to all the different student groups and we’ve had a lot of nice events.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Five professors from various university departments spoke about recent developments in their research and other ideas at the third annual UCSB TEDx talk on Saturday in Embarcadero Hall in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Technology, Entertainment, Design, or TED, is a nonprofit organization aimed at spreading general knowledge about the world and new ideas through a series of conferences. The organization hosts a main event every year in Vancouver, Canada, but also promotes independently organized events on a local scale called TEDx. This year’s TEDxUCSB is titled “Unveiling the New: In the Pursuit of the Next” and was organized by the Regents and Chancellor’s Scholars Association (RCSA).</p>\n<p>Featured presenters included chemical engineering professor Frank Doyle, Gevirtz Graduate School of Education lecturer Jason Duque Raley, computer science professor Diana Franklin, sociology professor Victor Rios and sociology Professor Emeritus Thomas Scheff. Two pre-recorded TED talks by British journalist Matt Ridley and neuroscience professor at Baylor College of Medicine David M. Eagleman were also played at the event.</p>\n<p>Second-year zoology major and TEDx Event Organizer Edward Trout said TEDx conferences are valuable because the talks expose students to a slew of new ideas.</p>\n<p>“TEDx breaks through the brilliant shroud that surrounds all this knowledge and allows us all to see it, allows us to think about it, allows us to spread it around,” Trout said. “‘Ideas worth spreading,’ that’s the TED motto.”</p>\n<p>The attendee application required potential audience members to submit their own idea worth spreading, and answers were projected onto a screen as audience members entered Embarcadero Hall. The submissions ranged from the colonization of other planets to healthcare reform and the emotional struggle of the research process.</p>\n<p>Rios, the first presenter, spoke about the need to reassess current education strategies in order to effectively teach millennial students. According to Rios, this generation is considered by some authors and scholars to be the “dumbest” and most “narcissistic” generation yet, an idea he said he disagrees with.</p>\n<p>“We got it all wrong — politicians, education systems, the media,” Rios said. “In national surveys and local studies, we’re finding that your generation craves emotional connection — that your generation actually empathizes in a larger, deeper way than former generations.”</p>\n<p>Rios said the key to educating a globally connected millennial generation is to modify current strategies of education to be more emotional, citing studies that found millennials are more focused on personal connections and making an impact on society, rather than earning more money at the expense of others.</p>\n<p>“When we teach to the heart, the mind follows,” Rios said. “When we connect with [students] in an emotional way, in a compassionate way, it opens up avenues for them to learn in an academic setting.”</p>\n<p>Doyle spoke next and discussed his 20 years of research in control engineering, including the creation of an artificial pancreas to automate insulin delivery in patients with Type 1 diabetes based on a concept called feedback control.</p>\n<p>“If I were to break down feedback control into a very simple definition, it’s these three words: ‘sense and respond,’” Doyle said.</p>\n<p>According to Doyle, insulin pumps and glucose sensors are currently available to help diabetes patients, but only focus on either the sense or respond parts of the equation.</p>\n<p>“What’s missing is that conjunction in the middle, the ‘and,’” Doyle said. “So our research has been all about that little three-letter word, the conjunction ‘and,’ making these two pieces better, responding to glucose measurements, squirting the insulin in just such a way that we can optimize those blood sugars.”</p>\n<p>Doyle said the pancreas’s control of blood sugar levels is an example of a negative feedback loop, producing hormone insulin when blood sugar levels are high, in order stabilize blood glucose levels and glucagon when blood sugar levels drop in order to raise them. The pancreas produces insulin to mitigate the potentially dangerous effects of high blood sugar including organ damage, a process that fails to occur in individuals with Type 1 diabetes.</p>\n<p>Doyle also said using a control algorithm in a chip or tablet connected to the sensing and responding technology allowed his research group to create a device to monitor and secrete insulin to stabilize the patient’s blood sugar levels to be in a healthy range, closing the feedback loop broken by diabetes, and thus treating a disease that currently affects millions.</p>\n<p>“The improper secretion of insulin leads to diabetes, which is a worldwide problem,” Doyle said. “It probably touches many of you in the audience, unfortunately. Friends, family members, neighbors — close to 400 million people in the world suffer from diabetes, and about half of them aren’t even diagnosed.”</p>\n<p>Varun Battu, a second-year biochemistry major, said he found Doyle’s talk fascinating because it applied biochemistry principles to technology.</p>\n<p>“It’s biochem — it’s literally what I like, and he’s applying it to a real world situation,” Battu said. “It’s really innovative and state-of-the-art — the top of his field.”</p>\n<p>Franklin’s talk focused on the growing, education-based gap between economic classes and how computer science, an increasingly important field, can help close this gap. Franklin said she believes computer science can be used to combat inequality by integrating it into fourth-through-sixth-grade curriculums, exposing underprivileged children to computing early in life.</p>\n<p>“All of these children would see that everyone can do it,” Franklin said. “There is nothing special about being in computing. Anyone can be in computer science.”</p>\n<p>Franklin said she and a team of computer scientists created a summer camp called Animal Tlatoque, which combined educational workshops on culture, art and computing and, according to surveys, successfully heightened children’s interest in computer science.</p>\n<p>“By integrating computer science into an engaging, interdisciplinary camp we could really get students to get excited about it,” Franklin said.</p>\n<p>Professor Emeritus of sociology Thomas Scheff discussed the importance of expressing negative emotions in mental health.</p>\n<p>“Emotions are very confusing because we have a whole culture in the West which makes fun of emotions and ignores them and says they’re not important,” Scheff said. “When they do happen, they’re a pest.”</p>\n<p>Scheff said English’s inaccurate words for expressing emotions complicate the study of emotions.</p>\n<p>“It’s a field that is harassed, especially in English, by the ambiguity and circumstantial grasp of emotion terms,” Scheff said. “Pride can be a good thing. You should be proud your children accomplished so much, but it can also be the seventh deadly sin.”</p>\n<p>According to Scheff, each emotion has a different signal of resolution — a different way the hormones produced by the emotion are metabolized by the body — and this signal is the healthiest way to deal with emotions.</p>\n<p>“When you’re talking about grief — if you lose someone that’s close to you, your body prepares to sob with tears … if that is delayed, you feel grief … fear, grief, shame, anger are not negative when they’re not obstructed,” Scheff said. “They go through your body — they’re something you need to do, just like breathing.”</p>\n<p>Duque spoke about reformulating common complaints about the educational system and trying to make the educational community understand that the current system shrinks students’ worlds by encouraging them to become competitive and answer-focused learners.</p>\n<p>“I think we mostly have things we can agree on when we think about school. School works for some kids and doesn’t for others,” Duque said. “We’ve got a collection of complaints about schooling but … then what?”</p>\n<p>Duque said he built a new set of complaints when he examined a kindergarten class in a dual immersion Spanish-English school designed to give underrepresented children a better chance to succeed academically. According to Duque, the students initially sought out other students to learn with, but the openness had decreased by January of the school year.</p>\n<p>“It begins to look like the children have learned that the world is not only theirs to explore, but that other people are either competitors for a place to declare what they know or they’re people who already possess knowledge,” Duque said. “Other people are threats and at least part of the time, other people are to be feared.”</p>\n<p>According to Duque, students’ passion for learning can only be encouraged by drastically changing how the students are formally taught.</p>\n<p>“Be outrageous in your refusal to do things the same old way because, let me tell you, we keep doing things the same old way; kids are going to keep learning the same old thing,” Duque said. “And that same old thing they’re learning is, from where I stand, a tragedy.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics math major and volunteer for the TEDx event Dixon Bourne said the event taught him to be more courageous.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to try to be less cautious,” said Bourne. “Just try things and not be afraid to fail. That’s probably one of the biggest things I learned.”</p>\n<p>Eric Seeberger, a second-year mechanical engineering major and TEDx attendee, said his “idea worth sharing” is about the increasing importance of finding sustainable energy solutions.</p>\n<p>“I think that the most important technology we should be researching is becoming energy independent,” Seeberger said. “Solar power is important and in the far future, nuclear fusion would probably be the best way to sustain that.”</p>\n<p>Third-year electrical engineering major, Event Coordinator and Speaker Liaison Mary Alice Callaghan said she was amazed by the wealth of opportunities and ideas available to students in everyday life.</p>\n<p>“What I took away from this conference, even more so than last year, was that there are just so many great minds and great opportunities on this campus — these great talks came from professors on our campus,” Callaghan said, “You think of TEDx as this really cool, once-a-year event that you come to experience these ideas, but they’re really out there all the time if you just go looking for them.”</p>\n<p>According to Trout, the TEDx model is important because it shares cutting edge ideas while fostering a sense of community.</p>\n<p>“TEDx embodies a mission that is important to me and important to all of us,” Trout said. “Not only is it presented to the community, TEDx is made by the community. Speakers of the sciences, arts and humanities — they all come together and present their ideas to you. They unveil the new and they allow all of us to pursue what’s next.”</p>\n<p>Trout said this year’s TEDx is especially important to him because TEDx 2014 was the last time he would see high school friend Chris Martinez, member of last year’s TEDx crew and victim of last May’s shooting.</p>\n<p>“When he [Martinez] found out we were putting on the TEDx event, he was so excited to be a part of it, to be part of what it was, part of what this is,” said Trout. “This TEDx is important to me personally now because it involves him. However, I would rather celebrate his life and what he did by showing you all awesome things rather than mourn him for too long.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/professors-present-at-tedxucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/professors-present-at-tedxucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/professors-present-at-tedxucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/professors-present-at-tedxucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-13/professors-present-at-tedxucsb/","id":2819,"author":{"id":157,"name":"Kendra Witt"},"related":[2818,2817,2816],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Anthony Pimentel, a third-year political science major, is the candidate running with Campus United. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internal Vice President is responsible for presiding over Senate and advising the A.S. President on campus issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho and Pimentel currently serve as on-campus and off-campus senators respectively. As part of their responsibilities as senators, both also work with boards, committees and units (BCUs) and organizations on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the A.S. Senate website, Ho serves with A.S. Publications and Note Taking, Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) and Queer Commission</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel works with the A.S. Food Bank, Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) and Human Rights Board (HRB). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the issues addressed during Tuesday’s debate:</span></p>\n<p><b>LARGEST INTERNAL PROBLEM:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho believes the largest internal problem in A.S. is a “lack of transparency between BCUs, senators and executives,” referencing the issues of procurement that occurred last fall when many members of Associated Students were not told what was happening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said that the biggest problem in A.S. is accountability. He wants to tackle this by expanding the role of the accountability chairs to “ensure that all senators are being held accountable.” </span></p>\n<p><b>LEGAL CODE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel believes that the legal code is the “foundation of the association.” While he believes it is tricky because it’s a fluid document, he says it also serves as a guide for everyone in A.S. and wants to make sure that all senators are aware of how to amend it to meet students’ needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho cited his experience reading the legal code multiple times, saying that when he was first elected senator, he was the first person to write a bill to change the legal code “before other senators even knew what legal code was.” He believes the institutional knowledge he gained working as a senator will allow him to help fix the legal code, as it is currently “outdated.”</span></p>\n<p><b>AD-HOC COMMITTEES:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a co-chair of the Textbook Affordability Committee, Ho said he has “fostered the collaboration of the BCUs, the Student Initiative Recruitment and Retention Committee” to work on getting students involved in the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel is currently a chair for the Mental Health Ad-Hoc Committee and worked on legislation earlier in the year to support students with mental health issues.</span></p>\n<p><b>A.S. WEBSITE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said the A.S. website should be an essential resource for students because the association is in charge of approximately $13 million of public money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho wants to have the association make their resolutions, bills, agendas and BCU minutes accessible to all students and public on the A.S. website. </span></p>\n<p><b>DIVISIONS IN SENATE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho spoke about his current experience in Senate, saying that he “knows what it feels like to have senators across the table dehumanize [him] and marginalize [him].” As IVP, he said he wants to make it clear that hate and personal attacks on other senators cannot and will not be tolerated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel spoke about wanting to effectively facilitate Senate and wants to ensure that “every single senator feels comfortable in the Flying A Room where Senate meetings take place.”</span></p>\n<p><b>CURRENT IVP:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said he believes the current IVP does a great job of keeping Senate organized and bringing people together. However, he wants to make himself more available and encourage one-on-one contact with all senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho also praised the current IVP’s ability to foster a collaborative environment in Senate, saying he’s been able to work on bills and initiatives across party lines. </span></p>\n<p><b>MALE-DOMINATED VOICES IN A.S.:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho recognized it is difficult for female-identifying senators to speak up, but said there are currently an equal number of male and female voices at the table. If elected as IVP, he wants to make sure to constantly remind everyone that every senator at the table has an opinion that should be valued and heard by everyone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel talked about how he has witnessed “mansplaining” in the organization numerous times and wants to create a culture of respecting everyone’s opinions.</span></p>\n<p><b>CONNECTIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel stressed the importance of having “positive, strong relationships” with student leaders and campus organizations as well as the administration in order to get work done. Pimentel personally worked with Marisela Marquez and Housing and Residential Services in his time as a senator and wants to continue to strengthen those relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho said he was “heavily involved” in the demands for the RCSGD and the undocumented students’ demands for access to more resources. He said his involvement in these initiatives as well as with Campus Democrats has allowed him to make connections with administrators and student leaders on campus. </span></p>\n<p><b>FAVORITE RESOLUTION:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho said his favorite resolution he authored was one that called for the resignation of the director of the RCSGD because the student staff felt the director was not meeting their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel’s favorite resolution he authored was a recent one condemning anti-semitism and hate speech on campus.</span></p>\n<p><b>NEWCEN INITIATIVE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said having the NewCen initiative on the ballot allows students to have the opportunity to vote on the project and have their voices heard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho expressed strong opposition to the fact students would have to pay for the NewCen project. He said students already pay enough tuition as it is and that the university should be responsible for the costs of the renovation. </span></p>\n<p><b>CONTRASTS WITH OPPONENT:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho said that as a senator, he was the first to write and pass a bill during his term. He stressed that his collaboration with BCUs and active presence at their meetings would help him in the position of IVP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel addressed his time management skills and work ethic. He talked about holding two jobs besides senator, but said he attended every senate meeting. He also emphasized his interest in speaking to and working with people who have a multitude of different perspectives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting for the A.S. election begins Monday, April 23, and closes Thursday, April 26.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
