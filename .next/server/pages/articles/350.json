Despite recording a season-high 53.8 three-point percentage, UCSB nearly matched its season-high total of 27 turnovers it set in its first meeting against the Mustangs with 24 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara still managed to register a 42. 9 field goal percentage, narrowly edged by the Mustangs’ 44.4 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>An early 5-2 lead in the game’s beginning was the only time UCSB led in Saturday’s game. The small margin would not last as the Mustangs’ 60 percent shooting percentage along with a 9-1 run helped it to take an 18-15 lead to end the first quarter.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly was most productive in the second quarter, outscoring UCSB 19-9 to enter halftime with a double-figure lead 37-24. At the helm of the Mustangs’ scoring attack in the first half was sophomore guard Dynn Leaupepe, scoring 14 of her game-high 20 points in the first two quarters. She closed out the first half with back-to-back three-pointers as she finished with 10 points in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, providing UCSB with points was guards senior Jasmine Ware and junior Onome Jemerigbe. The two combined for 16 of the Gauchos’ 24 first half points. Ware led UCSB in scoring with 14 points, while Jemerigbe concluded Saturday with 11 points and a game-high five assists. Sophomore forward Chaya Durr finished with 10 points and a game-high eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs gained their largest lead of 14-points at the 9:25 mark of the third quarter with a 40-26 lead.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the fourth quarter in which UCSB brought its deficit within single-figures. A layup by sophomore forward Taylor Farris trimmed Cal Poly’s lead to an eight-point margin of 55-47. The basket sparked UCSB’s 7-0 run, bringing the Gauchos within three, 52-55.</p>\n<p>Following a layup by Cal Poly junior forward Hannah Gilbert, Farris answered with a three-pointer to bring UCSB within its closest deficit of two points at 55-57.</p>\n<p>As the momentum gradually shifted in favor of the Gauchos, a dagger from beyond the arc by senior guard Beth Balbierz handed Cal Poly a 60-55 lead with 36 seconds remaining in the game. She was the Mustangs’ second leading scorer with 14 points on 2-3 shooting from long range.</p>\n<p>UCSB fouled the Mustangs in the game’s remaining seconds in hope of completing its combeack, but Cal Poly shot a perfect 6-6 from the free-throw line in the final quarter to secure its 66-60 victory.</p>\n<p>While a total of four different Gauchos scored double-figures in points, UCSB’s starting lineup struggled in its matchup versus UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting 42.4 percent from the field, Ware was the Gauchos only double-figure scorer with a game-high 17 points off the bench.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara didn’t have any illustrious individual performances Thursday night, its 53 rebounds was the most it recorded in a conference game this season. UCSB outrebounded UCI 53-30, helping result in the Gauchos outscoring the Anteaters 26-8 in the paint and 15-4 on second chance points.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Thursday’s victory was one of UCSB’s best defensive performances of the season as it held UC Irvine to 31.0 shooting and 14.3 three-point percentages. The Gauchos held UCI to just four points twice in the second and fourth quarters.</p>\n<p>In addition, UCSB prevented all UCI players from scoring within double-figures as the Anteaters leading scorer was freshman guard Andee Ritter.</p>\n<p>Farris tied her career-high of 13 rebounds in Thursday’s 66-37 win over UCI.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final game of the season this Thursday, Feb. 3 at Hawaii at 9 p.m. HST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68673\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68673\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/gauchos-cruise-past-uci-66-37-come-up-short-in-66-60-loss-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/","id":350,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[349,348,347],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Late Game Lay-Up Drowns UCSB in 58-55 Loss to LBSU Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=795%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A costly turnover in the last minute of Saturday's game versus Long Beach State resulted in the UCSB women's basketball team being defeated by the 49ers 58-55.

We forced her middle to her left hand which is where she wants to go and it’s an And-1. Just undisciplined.”</p>\n<p>Hope remained on the UCSB sideline as junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe dashed coast to coast for the game-tying layup with 10 seconds to send the game into overtime. But the Gauchos’ comeback chances were ended when 49ers’ junior forward Madison Montgomery rejected the layup attempt prompting the game’s ending with a 58-55 LBSU victory after a made free-throw by junior guard Anna Kim.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 10-17 overall and 7-6 in the Big West. Long Beach State improved to 19-7 and 8-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s loss made the race for a top-four seed in the Big West Conference standings more challenging for the Gauchos as they missed out on the opportunity to tie the 49ers for fourth-place. In addition to UC Davis losing to UCR, Long Beach State was able to move up to third-place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>However, during Saturday’s post-game interview, Coach Henrickson assured the media that the team’s standing was the least of her worries with three games remaining in the regular season.</p>\n<p>“The best thing we could have done was beat Long Beach [Saturday],” Henrickson said. “I’ve looked at the format, but I need to focus on us playing better. I don’t get caught up in all of that. If we play well, all that will take care of itself.”</p>\n<p>The format of the Big West Tournament permits the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds to skip the first two rounds of the tournament onto the semifinal. As for the No. 3 and No. 4 seeds, they are granted a first-round bye.</p>\n<p>It is highly unlikely that UCSB will earn a No. 1 or No. 2 seed at this point in the season, but the Gauchos could possibly earn the No. 3 seed or a likely No. 4 seed as UC Davis sits ahead of UCSB in fourth-place at 8-5 in Big West play.</p>\n<p>With low-scoring totals from both teams, the largest lead of Saturday’s game was from Long Beach by a deficit of seven. Three points was the largest scoring differential by quarters as the 49ers narrowly outscored UCSB 16-13 in the third period.</p>\n<p>No player in UCSB’s starting lineup finished with double-figures in points, leaving the offensive duties to the Gauchos’ reserves off the bench.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB was more efficient shooting the ball than LBSU amassing a 45.2 field goal percentage to the 49ers’ 36.2 percentage. Santa Barbara was able to surpass the 49ers’ full-court press and 2-3 zone defense, but still had 23 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“I thought the press was better at their place,” Henrickson said. “But how many of those [turnovers] are unforced? Travel, dribble pick-ups, and throwing it out of bounds. It’s just undisciplined. That’s my responsibility, I’ve got a role in that as well. They [LBSU] can turn us over, but we turned ourselves over.”</p>\n<p>Leading Santa Barbara in points was senior guard Jasmine Ware with 16 points as she nearly registered her first-career triple-double tallying eight assists and six rebounds as well. Adding to the Gauchos’ production off the bench was Newton, who recorded her second double-double of the season with 14 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Newton’s 6-6 performance at the free throw line in the first half provided the majority of points in Santa Barbara’s 10-2 run, giving it a 27-25 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>In spite of its momentum to close out the first half, UCSB was sluggish in the second half and failed to contain LBSU in the opening of the third quarter, allowing the 49ers to go on a 9-0 run to take a 34-27 lead.</p>\n<p>“I thought we were terrible and we were up by two,” Henrickson said. We had no pop, no energy. [It shows] how consistent you have to be, how well you have to play, and how hard you have to play every single night. We’re not flying around, it’s quiet… that’s frustrating.”</p>\n<p>Yet, UCSB’s 5-0 scoring run after calling a timeout trimmed its deficit to two at 32-34.</p>\n<p>Two quick fouls during the first quarter led to Benton playing in just three minutes of the first half as she sat out the entirety of the second quarter, having taken no shot attempts in the first half.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first half, Benton erupted for all 19 of her points in the second half. She scored the 49ers’ last 11 points of the third quarter and had eight points in the fourth quarter. She concluded Saturday shooting 7-11 from the field and went 5-6 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>The 49ers entered Saturday’s matchup shooting over 35 percent from beyond the arc in conference play, but were contained to a 23.5 three-point percentage, going 4-17 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>However, draining two pivotal three-pointers was sophomore guard Gigi Hascheff. She finished the game with 11 points and at one point with 4:47 remaining in the game it was her shot form long-range that handed LBSU a 52-51 lead.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB managed to gain the lead twice after Hascheff’s three-pointer, Benton’s scoring outburst was too much for the Gauchos to contain as she led the 49ers to their 58-55 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play in its last home game of the season this Thursday, Feb. 25 versus UC Irvine at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68501\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68501\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/","id":347,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[346,345,344],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Basketball Makes It Four Straight With Win Over UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.21_StephenManga_MensBBall-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.21_StephenManga_MensBBall-6-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos continued their hot run to improve to 7-5 in conference play and are now two games out of second place.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68455\" style=\"width: 251px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68455\" data-attachment-id=\"68455\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/eric-childress-drives-into-the-paint-for-a-layup-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.21_StephenManga_MensBBall-6-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Eric Childress drives into the paint for a layup.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Thanks to a pestering presence on defense, forcing 24 points off 20 turnovers, and a 21-point outing from guard Gabe Vincent, the UCSB men’s basketball team extended its winning streak to four games at home on Saturday night beating UC Davis for the second straight time with a final score of 62-55.</p>\n<p>“What we’re doing is getting a lot scrappier,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We have this four game winning streak and we’ve only had one good shooting night [aside from Cal State Fullerton]. Our defense, energy, and everything about us is getting better and better.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, which was 3-5 and in sixth place in conference to begin the month of February, now improves to 7-5 in the Big West with an overall record of 13-12. The Gauchos are two games back from second place UC Irvine and Long Beach State, both hosting a Big West record of 9-3.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Aggies, 10-16 overall, lose their fourth straight game and drop to a conference record of 5-8.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gotten back over the break even mark and that’s a very good thing,” Williams stated. “I thought we played really hard tonight. We didn’t shoot well, which they had a lot to do with, but we played very hard.”</p>\n<p>While it wasn’t the cleanest first half for either team, committing a total of 21 turnovers, the Gauchos jumped out to a 31-20 advantage at halftime due to the shooting hand of Vincent. The shooting guard out of Stockton, CA went 4-7 from the field scoring seven of his teams first 13 points. Vincent led all scorers at the break with 10 points.</p>\n<p>Drawing two early fouls and struggling to find his rhythm offensively, senior guard Michael Bryson made his presence known in other categories during the first half. The 6’4” wing recorded seven rebounds, two blocks, and three steals. Bryson also hit home six of his teams seven free throws in the first period, going a perfect six-for six behind the free throw stripe.</p>\n<p>Facing an uphill battle similar to their match on Thursday, the Aggies clawed their way back in the second half this time from 11-points. Davis shaved the Gauchos’ lead down to five with 18:27 to go as junior Brynton Lamar finished strong to the rack and then followed it up with a mid-range jump shot to have his team trail 26-31.</p>\n<p>The third year guard finished second in scoring for Davis on Saturday, one point shy of senior Josh Fox’s team-high 17 points. Not only Lemar keep the game within reach scoring 11 of his 16 points in the second half, the San Diego, CA native earned himself a double-double crashing the boards on offense and defense for a total of 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite a strong effort from Fox and Lemar, the Gauchos ended the game in dramatic fashion as junior guard Eric Childress led a 3-on-2 break and dished a no-look pass to Vincent for the go-ahead dunk with 1:02 remaining. Vincent’s slam magnified UCSB’s lead to 10 after that point.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also had a major boost from its bench, including a 9-point contribution from senior forward Mitch Brewe. The 6’8” senior scored seven of his nine points in the first half and helped add to the Gauchos’ season-high 13 steals with two picks.</p>\n<p>“I just tried to bring a lot of energy physicality, and a big defensive presence [tonight],” Brewe said. “I didn’t do a good job of finishing in the beginning of the game but [afterwards] got in a rhythm a little bit. I think coming off the bench bringing a lot of energy and keeping the level high is really important.”</p>\n<p>“It was a team win for everybody tonight,” said Childress. “We just knew we had to make plays.[Davis] is a physical team and when we have a night like this when we’re not shooting well we have to be aggressive back with them and our bench came in and did that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has outscored its opponents’ bench in each of its last four games, averaging 20.5 points per game. This is a reasonable chunk of their 70.1 point average per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sets foot on its two-game road trip this week starting with a Thursday night match against Cal State Northridge and a Saturday game at Fullerton. The Gauchos game at CSUN will take place in the Matadome at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

We’ve got to be as good as we’ve been all year. Be more discipline, [against CSULB] we gave up middle drives, didn’t communicate switches, and turned the ball over too many times.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters tonight game with an overall record of 10-17, 7-6 in the Big West. The Gauchos sit at fifth in the conference standings, narrowly trailing UCD, who is currently in fourth at 8-5. UC Irvine is clinging onto its eighth-place position with its 8-22 and 1-11 conference record. It owns just one less loss than CSUF, who is 1-12 in the Big West. Cal Poly is 13-14 overall and 6-8 in Big West play for sixth-place, attempting to bounce back from its 61-56 loss to Long Beach State last night.</p>\n<p>In store for the Gauchos are two opponents with similar playing styles that revolve around their frontcourts. This week’s games will be UCSB’s second meeting against both teams. Santa Barbara will hope to establish a better defensive effort after allowing field goal percentages above 40 percent against both opponents earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Once again, UCSB will attempt to contain the interior presence of UCI’s duo of junior forwards Mokun Fajemisin and Shereen Sutherland.</p>\n<p>Fajemisin’s rebounding and blocking abilities are most challenging when facing the Anteaters. In addition to ranking fifth in the Big West in rebounds per game at 7.6, her average of 2.2 blocks per game leads the conference. Fajemisin will come into tonight’s matchup with a streak of at least two blocks in the past four consecutive games.</p>\n<p>While Sutherland’s averages of 21. 8 minutes and 7.8 points per game aren’t astounding, her versatile skillset of post offense and mid-range shooting can be difficult to defend.</p>\n<p>“[Fajemisin] really bothered us,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. “Sutherland is a really talented kid who just didn’t have much rhythm there. She got some step away [opportunities] and pulled Je Zhe away from the basket. We fouled too much. It will be important for us to pressure defensively, force tough twos, and rebound.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ended its first matchup against UCI with 24 personal fouls, sending the Anteaters to the free-throw line where they went 16-23.</p>\n<p>In just 24 minutes played, Fajemisin led the Anteaters with 16 points on 6-13 shooting from the floor while adding six rebounds, two steals and three blocks. Sutherland will look to improve her three foul performance in which she had one point at the free-throw line in 14 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Despite allowing a 40. 4 opponent field goal percentage against the Anteaters in the first meeting, UCSB recorded its third-best shooting performance of the season at 54.4 percent.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe with a career-high 20 points along with a combined 33 points from junior center Je Zhe Newton and freshman guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the Gauchos will look to confine the Anteaters’ offense tonight, which has struggled on the road averaging just 54.1 ppg and a 32.5 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Following UCSB’s final home game, it will begin its two-game road trip at Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>In spite of falling short in the team’s Senior Day celebration last weekend, UCSB will hope to send out its senior group— Jasmine Ware, Dioseline Lopez, and Kendra Morrison— with one last victory over its Blue-Green rival.</p>\n<p>“We beat them at home, that was the first time I ever beat them in all my four years here so that was good,” Ware said. “It would be even better to beat them at home, at their place. We just have to take care of business at home, then worry about the road. From here on out its just one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ pursuit of sweeping the season series against the Mustangs will be intense as they prepare to face one of the best defenses in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly currently leads the conference in opponent field goal percentage, limiting offenses to a 37.2 average percentage.</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs’ defense has helped to stifle opponents, their offense has yet to truly discover a consistent source of scoring. However, emerging in the team’s last three game has been senior guard Beth Balbierz. She has averaged 21.0 ppg over the Mustangs’ last three contests and is second on the team in scoring with 12.9 ppg.</p>\n<p>At the forefront of Cal Poly’s offense is junior forward Hannah Gilbert in the paint. She leads the Mustangs with 13.0 ppg, is third in the Big West in rebounds per game with an 8.7 average, and is second in field goal percentage at 53.3 percent.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tip-off will take place at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome. The Gauchos will face Cal Poly this Saturday, Feb. 26 at 2 p.m. in the Robert A. Mott Athletics Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/gauchos-host-uci-in-home-finale-prepare-to-close-out-season-with-blue-green-rivalry/","id":349,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[348,347,346],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
