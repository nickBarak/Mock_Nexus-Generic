That set up a last second shot for junior guard Emilie Johnson. Johnson drove down the court with less than ten seconds left, shooting a three pointer as time expired. The shot narrowly missed, securing a 64-63 victory for Idaho.</p>\n<p>“Obviously any time you lose a game this way, it’s brutal. It’s brutal for the players, and it’s brutal for the coaches,” Gottlieb said. “What I told the players in the locker room is that I’d go to work with this team any night. The thing I’m most proud of is the way we fought. You want to know you have a team that you can go to battle with anytime.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard Kelsey Adrian led the Gauchos with 15 points and nine rebounds. Sophomore forward Sweets Underwood posted a double-double with 12 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I feel as if I’m getting more aggressive as far as just going to the basket,” Underwood said. “I think that is one of the biggest parts of my game. Hopefully I can keep that consistency and stay aggressive on the boards as far as put backs.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s loss to Portland State proved to be just as tough for the Gauchos. UCSB had possession of the ball with six seconds left in overtime, but failed to get a shot off as they turned the ball over as time expired.</p>\n<p>“We are really disappointed not coming out of this game with a win,” Gottlieb said. “It was a tremendous battle, you know it was a good college basketball game, and there was a lot of effort. I thought we were much better consistently across the board defensively than we were in the first two games. We’ve got to get tougher and figure out how to make those plays in crunch time.”</p>\n<p>Underwood posted a career-high 15 points and added nine rebounds in the loss. Johnson, the team’s leading scorer entering the game, had eight points and six rebounds. Johnson had a chance to win the game with a three pointer as time expired, but the shot bounce off the rim.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was a really good shot,” senior forward Mekia Valentine said. “It was a good judgment call on her part to take that, it was just unlucky that it didn’t fall.”</p>\n<p>Valentine led the way for the Gauchos with 18 points and 14 rebounds, but fouled out in the crucial moments of overtime due to a new NCAA rule. The “elbow rule,” as it’s called, gives an automatic flagrant foul for any contact with an elbow to the body above the chest.</p>\n<p>“What happened was she posted me up and she put her elbow up,” Portland State junior forward Shauneice Samms said. “It hit me in my throat and the refs called it. I got two free throws, and I missed one of them, but the call was made.”</p>\n<p>That call proved to be costly for the Gauchos, giving the Vikings the ball and two free throws to seal the win.</p>\n<p>“Portland State is a good team,” Gottlieb said. “This one felt a little grittier and a lot more physical.

We have good guard play to control the ball so we need that to be key to score more and not turn the ball over.”</p>\n<p>Johnson led the Gauchos in points and assists with 14 and four, but she also committed a team high six turnovers. Sophomore guard Sweets Underwood added nine points for the Gauchos, while senior center Mekia Valentine was held in check with two points and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>“We put those turnovers on ourselves,” Johnson said. “UCLA put good pressure on us, but we made passes that we don’t normally do. We need to take better care of the ball. We need to get better in our next game. Turnovers and mistakes are what can happen when playing UCLA.”</p>\n<p>UCLA shot an efficient 43.8 percent on field goals, but only 12.5 from the three-point line. UCSB on the other hand shot 37.7 percent from the field and 25 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“I think in spurts we really competed with them,” Gottlieb said. “We showed we can play at this level. I feel UCLA is a legitimate top 15 team and they were a tough opponent. We just need to sustain the play for 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>Friday night’s game against Pepperdine proved to be a challenge for UCSB as well. After trailing by only three at half time, the Gauchos failed to stick with the Waves, being outscored 37-28 in the second half.</p>\n<p>“We have to get tougher, mentally and physically,” Johnson said. “We have to have a mentality of getting it done. What is important is being fighters and getting it done on offense and defense.”</p>\n<p>Adrian nearly had a double double against Pepperdine with 11 points and nine rebounds. Johnson led UCSB with 15 points making seven of 14 shots, but only one of five from behind the three point line. Valentine added three points and seven rebounds, and freshman guard Melissa Zornig added nine points for the Gauchos, as well as leading the team with three assists.</p>\n<p>“Collectively we need to be tougher. We need to sustain our team intensity for 40 minutes and be the aggressors and make the other teams respond to us and our play,” Gottlieb said. “Our goal is to be a complete team. If facing pressure we need to break the press, if they put two defenders down low on Mekia we need to be able to pass it out to the perimeter and knock down shots. Overall, we need to be a complete team on offense. And on defense we need to know how to stop everyone, no matter our opponent.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is on Thursday, Nov. 18, at 1 p.m. at the Thunderdome against Portland State.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29732\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/womens-basketball-drops-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29732\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/womens-basketball-drops-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/womens-basketball-drops-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/womens-basketball-drops-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-15/womens-basketball-drops-road/","id":900,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[899,898,897],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kevin Love: You’re Awesome and Here’s Why","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For the uninitiated, Kevin Love is one of the best players in the NBA.

There, I said it. The former UCLA star has blown past racial and body-type expectations to drop the first 30-30 game since Moses Malone’s more than 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>Some may say that his 30-30 came against the hurry-up Knicks — a team about as renowned for its strong rebounding as Shaq is for showing up to camp in shape — but he still put up 23-24 against my hometown Lakers.</p>\n<p>Although Love is far and away the best Timberwolf, the begoggled Kurt Rambis seems to be unable to see past what Love can’t do. Sure he’s not the ideal size for the four and quicker power forwards will eat him for lunch, but the boy can play. Pure and simple.</p>\n<p>Bad teams obsess about what their stars can’t do. We saw it in Memphis when they shipped the still-young Pau Gasol to LA for Javaris Crittenton, Kwame Brown and the rights to his younger brother, and we even saw it in Minnesota earlier this year when they swapped Al Jefferson to Utah for Kosta Koufous. For Memphis, the deal worked out in a way —Marc proved to be a borderline All-Star at the five and they shipped away Agent Zero so that he could try to exercise his (pretend) license to kill in DC — but Pau’s presence in LA sent the Lakers to three straight Finals and inspired a nation to wonder if Chris Wallace was taking revenge on his former employers.</p>\n<p>For every well-run team in the league, the top priority is discerning the strengths of their stars and filling the rest of the team with players to compliment that strength. The Heat are the obvious exception to this rule — they decided to go and get the best player in the league to compliment their star — but for positive evidence of this working right away, look no further than the Magic.</p>\n<p>Their best player, Dwight Howard, is worthless on offense if the opposing big is his size. He can’t shoot worth a lick and his free throw percentage is in Shaq-ian territory. Some teams would wail and moan about why their star can’t step out to the three-point line to turn around a foundering offense,­­ but Otis Smith coolly stocked the rest of the team with lights-out shooters (ridiculously overpaying Rashard Lewis in the process) that turn Howard’s weaknesses into team-wide strengths.</p>\n<p>Love isn’t quite the defensive force that Howard is, but might be an even better rebounder and is a better outlet passer, with a decent outside shot to boot. A smart team would plug him into a system with a speedy point guard, a few athletic wings and a leaper opposite him at center to deal with the shots that Love is too ground-bound to contest. Kahn has made nods toward those things — he drafted three point guards a year ago to go with the three small forwards he picked up this year — but seems intent on saddling Love with a coach that either doesn’t know or doesn’t care that the front office spent the summer shipping away the team’s former star (the unbelievably underrated Al Jefferson) so that Love could finally have the spotlight to shine. And don’t even get me started on Michael Beasley. He’s a power forward, Kurt. Play him there.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Artsweek editor <em>Michael Hafford wishes he could find someone that could complement his strengths and weaknesses.
