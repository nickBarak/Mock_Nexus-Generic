The Baby-Faced Assassin. The Human Torch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry has earned a bunch of nicknames throughout his storied career. Already a two-time (and once unanimous) MVP, three-time champion and “greatest shooter ever” by the age of 31, Curry’s career is almost perfect. He’s currently playing against his younger brother in the Western Conference Finals and is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and former Virginia Tech Volleyball player Sonya Curry; to the casual observer it must look like he was destined for greatness. If you’ve followed him closely throughout the years, however, you would know that that wasn’t always the case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I certainly didn’t think I was watching an all-time great player when I first really started following the Warriors my freshman year of high school. Up to that point, my knowledge of the Dubs mostly revolved around my older family members’s memories of the Run TMC era, being snuck into Oakland bars as a kid to watch the 2007 We Believe Team and being oddly drawn to shooting guard Kelenna Azubuike because of his awesome name. I certainly remember feeling furious that Monta Ellis didn’t get an All-Star bid, and venting with my stepfather when we traded him for Andrew Bogut. Still, other than my friends and I (regrettably) nicknaming Curry “Noodle Legs” because of his ankle injuries, none of the early memories of my Warriors fandom really involved him.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That all changed in the 2012-13 NBA playoffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Warriors were a plucky six-seed that year led by second-year coach Mark Jackson and Steph Curry, who had garnered national attention earlier in the season when he scored 54 points against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Most Warriors fans at that point had conceded that trading Ellis was the right way to go, but I personally still wasn’t sure how far Curry could take us. Little did I know that this would be the debut of one of the most dominant postseason players the game has ever seen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steph was on fire in the first round against the Nuggets, torching the Denver defense for two 30-point performances sandwiched around a 29-point game, and leading the Warriors to their first playoff series victory in six years. When he then turned around and dropped 44 points in the first game of the Western Conference Semifinals on the Spurs, the whole league was put on notice </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people started to understand that this guard who had been hampered by injuries could really ball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He elevated himself from a good shooter to a great player, and after losing to the Clippers in an emotionally charged first-round series in 2014, the stage was set for him to truly take his game to the next level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that’s exactly what he did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curry did more than just change public perception during his first MVP season in 2015; he actually shifted the landscape of the entire NBA. While old heads like Charles Barkley dismissed the eventual champion Warriors as a “jump-shooting team,” while an East Coast-biased media elevated teams like the Hawks or Cavs over the Dubs, while Houston fans and their team obnoxiously campaigned for James Harden to win the Most Valuable Player award </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Steph and the Warriors just kept on winning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They eventually faced off against the “Grit ‘n Grind” Memphis Grizzlies in the second round of the 2015 playoffs, and as Curry sunk shots from the opposing free-throw line, it was almost as if we could see the passing of the torch right in front of our eyes. The Warriors’s ball movement, quick and smart defense and shot-making ability simply brushed off the outdated bully ball style of the Grizzlies, and it was all catalyzed by number 30.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steph would end up leading the Warriors to a championship, following up with the greatest offensive season in history in which he averaged 30.1 points on 50/45/90 shooting and won a unanimous MVP. Being hampered by injuries and losing in seven games to the Cavs would also bring over Kevin Durant to create the best duo to ever step on a basketball court.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two championships later, this is where we stand. Curry already has the resume of the second-best point guard of all time. He is the leader of the statistically greatest starting lineup in NBA history, ranks ninth in points per game in the playoffs and is blowing away three-point shooting records with ease. When Kevin Durant went down with an injury this year, it was Curry with 33 points in the second half of game six to bury the “rival” Houston Rockets and advance to the Western Conference Finals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only inconsistent part of Curry’s game now seems to be the criticism levied against him and his team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, the Warriors were unfair because they got Kevin Durant. Then the Warriors needed Kevin Durant in order to win the championship. At first, Curry isn’t “clutch” because he doesn’t have a finals MVP. Then when he does carry the team, he’s a “frontrunner” or “showboat”. At first, the Warriors were a soft jump-shooting team that lucked into a finals. Then they became an illegal-screening, dirty powerhouse that bullied lesser squads into oblivion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While media talking-heads try to get their narratives together before another Warriors championship victory, Curry just continues to add to his legacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is the most selfless superstar the game has seen, embodies a leader in the truest sense of the word and belongs on the Mount Rushmore of NBA players. He is not just part of the greatest offense in the league, but is himself the greatest offense in the league. His gravity and the way he stretches out opposing defenses is something that has never been seen before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When his career is done, when the Warriors are back to being a middle-of-the-pack team playing in an overpriced San Francisco stadium, when their championship hopes are nothing but a memory, he will be talked about in the same way we talk about legends like Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should be grateful that we get to see him in his prime now.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Often this is true, whether it be Eli Manning leading the Giants on a fourth quarter comeback, or Jerry Rice cutting through the Bengals defense play after play, many Super Bowls have been decided simply by a great player taking control of the game. Although football is most definitely a team sport, it is also one in which moments and players are mythologized. “The Drive” and “The Catch” are two examples of how football fans and analysts love to find and memorialize key plays and players, especially in the biggest game of all.</p>\n<p>Super Bowl LII will be between the NFC Champion Philadelphia Eagles and the AFC Champion New England Patriots. As a Giants fan who has rooted against both these teams on many occasions, it pains me to say that they both have proved to be the best in their respective conferences without a doubt. Even with key injuries to both squads (Carson Wentz being out for the Eagles, Gronk missing some time for the Pats) they have actually gotten stronger as units as the year has gone on, which is precisely why it is hard to single out who the x-factor’s will be on both sides. Instead of just choosing a player who I think will be the best for each team, I split potential players into two tiers based on how likely they are to win Super Bowl MVP and overall what their impact will be on the field.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80727\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2023388365\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80733\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80727\" data-attachment-id=\"80727\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/super-bowl-lii-sleeper-picks/tom-brady-graphic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?fit=953%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"953,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"tom brady graphic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?fit=250%2C189&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?fit=888%2C671&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-80727\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=800%2C604\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"604\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?w=953&amp;ssl=1 953w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=250%2C189&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom-brady-graphic.jpg?resize=768%2C580&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80727\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin Son / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><b>The Favorites</b></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I predict that this year won’t be any different as both Tom Brady and Nick Foles, who have the best and second best chance to win the award according to Vegas, pretty much will have to carry their respective offenses. The Eagles and Patriots finished the regular season as bottom 10 rushing teams, and the Pats have only managed to muster up 73.5 yards per game in the playoffs. Foles and Brady have done a good job handling this load so far, as their 122 and 107 QBR show, but it remains to be seen which one will outshine the other.</p>\n<p><b>Dark Horses</b></p>\n<p>As opponents of the Patriots have learned in the past, the best way to mitigate Tom Brady’s impact is to get pressure on him, and if there is one thing Eagles DT Fletcher Cox knows how to do it’s creating pressure. His 10 combined tackles in the Postseason is the highest among Defensive Tackles, and while he only has one sack so far the amount of pressure he’s created indicates that he’s due for some more. If he’s able to disrupt the Patriots offensive line that’s only given up 3 sacks this year he could be heading home with the SBMVP trophy. On the Patriots side, Tight End Rob Gronkowski could be geared for a big game of his own. After being sidelined in the AFC Championship game with a concussion, Gronk will be looking to take advantage of his size in this upcoming matchup. He’ll have about a 6” height and 60 pound weight advantage over his primary defender who will be safety Malcolm Jenkins for the Eagles. IF Gronk is able to open up the field for Tom Brady, there’s no doubt that the Eagles will have a very tough time staying in the game, and he will likely be adding a Super Bowl MVP trophy to go along with a third championship ring.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Less than 24 hours after being arrested for domestic violence for the second time in the year — and subsequently being cut by the 49ers — second-year linebacker Reuben Foster was claimed immediately on waivers by the Washington Redskins.</p>\n<p>I know, I shouldn’t be surprised. NFL owners display an incorrigible lack of social awareness, and Redskins owner Dan Snyder is one of the worst offenders. Still, I can’t help but be disgusted. Truth be told, Foster should have been cut long ago by the 49ers. Already drafted with off-the-field issues, Foster was arrested in February for domestic violence and has reportedly had a police report filed against him last month. How many chances does one player get?</p>\n<p>Once again, the NFL displays their indifference toward violence against women. At his press conference this week, 49ers’ GM John Lynch said that releasing Foster “doesn’t mean we don’t love him.” In that conference, Lynch failed to mention the victim a single time. One would think the NFL would have learned from the Ray Rice situation, when in 2014 Rice was caught on video beating up his fiancé in an elevator. Somehow, Rice was only suspended for two games (for reference, smoking marijuana results in a four game suspension).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I remember writing an opinion piece in my high school newspaper about that incident, expressing both disappointment and dismay at Roger Goodell’s decision. This time, it is Dan Snyder who is purposely turning a blind eye toward violence against women. In today’s more socially aware society, with the #MeToo movement thriving, watching the NFL once again disregard domestic violence offences is beyond disheartening — it is unfathomable.</p>\n<p>As of now, Reuben Foster has been placed on the commissioner’s exempt list, meaning he is ineligible to play. Still, by signing Foster, the NFL makes him eligible to be present at the Redskins facility on a “reasonable basis.” Anyone who believes being back in an NFL facility is the best way for Foster to reform is incredibly naive. Senior VP for the Redskins Doug Williams stated that the decision was made after talking to a number of his former Alabama teammates, who defended the character of Foster. Sure, Foster has been arrested three times this year, but at least his college teammates said he was a real stand-up guy!</p>\n<p>The NFL does not care about women or domestic violence; they do not care about anything except lining their own pockets. Children look up to these athletes — so what kind of a message does it send when a player can get arrested twice in one year and still be signed immediately? More importantly, what kind of a message does it send to boys about how they should treat women?  At best, the NFL is apathetic toward violence against women; at worst, they are condoning the actions of these players, valuing wins over any sort of moral obligation.</p>\n<p>It is also impossible to look at this decision without wondering how Colin Kaepernick remains unsigned. How is it possible that a player who has been arrested twice in one year can get signed in a day, but Kaep remains unsigned? How is it possible that the Redskins last week signed Mark Sanchez — a mediocre quarterback best known for the infamous butt fumble who has only gotten worse with age — without even giving Kaepernick a workout?</p>\n<p>The message here is simple: African-American men can do anything they want, including being arrested for multiple felonies, as long as they don’t advocate for social change. To NFL owners, nonviolent protest is seen as a greater concern and threat to society than domestic violence. Everybody knows the NFL is never going to be a progressive league. After all, Snyder’s team is literally named the “Redskins,” a name Snyder laughably believes honors Native Americans. But it is becoming increasingly impossible for me to support — let alone watch — a league that refuses to take a stand against domestic violence.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 07 of the Nov. 29 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
