Are you looking for someone special? You probably aren't alone.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re part of a generation that thinks feelings are toxic. “Catching feelings” is an expression that characterizes them as something bad as opposed to what drives much of humanity’s actions. As a result of this patho-phobia, as I’ve decided to call it, we’ve come up with a myriad of ways to expedite the hookup process. Tinder, Grindr and other apps make it so people who want hookups feel entitled to sex at first swipe, and the rest are looked down upon as a gross minority — those pariahs who’d dare want a relationship. At this point in time, marriages are expected to end in divorce, and your romantic first-date story has the same chance of taking place at a drunken party as in a cozy section of the library. Is it any wonder that we’re all terrified of commitment? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s intriguing is that within this framework of apps, websites and glory-holes to help you get yours, there are actually people who manage to be in functional relationships — they’ll just never admit it. It’s actually ingenious, and it’s probably sexist to assume that it was a man who first decided that friends with benefits was the best idea ever. Sex with no strings attached is the definition of the term at its barest, and it seems to have taken on a new role in our culture. We define our obsession with a slew of movies and shows that use the friends with benefits situation to sell us a fear of commitment. It appeals to men because they see a situation in which they don’t have to commit but get their end goal, and it appeals to women because the situations depicted often show a level of intimacy more associated with, well, actual relationships. When you begin to analyze our obsession with this whole affair, you start to see that the friends with benefits mechanism is a way to sell relationships to the commitophobes. Don’t most of those movies end with the couple in question admitting their feelings and starting a relationship? </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems as though a lot of people actually want more but are afraid to ask. If you doubt that you’re alone in wanting something more than just a one night stand, look at YikYak. The UCSB area looks like a sounding board for the lonely hearts club. At some point the definitions have shifted, and that’s the only explanation I can come up with. How can one be in an exclusive hookup? If it’s an exclusive hookup, it’s a relationship, just not as “serious” as it would be if two people had actually agreed to be in one. Now, on the eve of 2016, the relationship state of the union has changed. Fucking is the new hooking up, hooking up is the new relationship and dating is the new getting engaged. If you’re getting married you might as well be sewing yourselves together given how foreign it is to some of the people in our generation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to understand. Many of us are children of divorce, and we’ve been told our whole lives that 50 percent of marriages end in divorce, so a lot of us have probably taken the cautionary tales to heart and don’t want to get ourselves too tangled up. Even more relevant is that most recent heartbreak you had from dating young that made you say you weren’t going to be in a relationship until you were really ready. But having feelings for someone else is a sign you are ready, especially if you’re willing to forgo sex with other people to be with them, and even more so if you hang out with them outside of your bedroom. Those of us in a college town, especially one with a reputation like UCSB (whether or not it’s deserving) bear the brunt of this hookup culture atmosphere that permeates our generation. College is a place where you go to learn independence, which can definitely mean sleeping around and sampling what the best frats have to offer. But it can also mean learning about love in a less sheltered setting, dealing with a breakup and having to go to school or work and be strong without a parent or your best friend from home to help you do it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dating in college, and actually calling it dating, provides us with valuable lessons we can’t learn later in life. If you forgo a relationship and deny your hookup any legitimacy, when you start dating as an adult, you’ll be jarred when relationships actually turn serious, and you’ve denied yourself the opportunity to dip your toes in the proverbial pool. College is fun, and so are hookups, but why deny yourself intimacy because you’re afraid you’ll get hurt? Life is about taking risks, and if you care about someone, don’t cheapen a relationship by saying you’re just hanging out. I guess to put it simply: Can’t we just admit we want to cuddle?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66069\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/being-in-a-relationship-without-being-in-a-relationship-a-modern-magic-trick/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66069\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/being-in-a-relationship-without-being-in-a-relationship-a-modern-magic-trick/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/being-in-a-relationship-without-being-in-a-relationship-a-modern-magic-trick/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/being-in-a-relationship-without-being-in-a-relationship-a-modern-magic-trick/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/being-in-a-relationship-without-being-in-a-relationship-a-modern-magic-trick/","id":6339,"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent"},"related":[6338,6337,6336],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent","biography":"Not available","articles":[6300,6302,6309,6339],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Your Valentine’s Day Treat – A Belated “Hump”","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cupid+graphicsfairyred.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cupid+graphicsfairyred.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Some entertaining Valentine's Day quizzes from the Sexperts.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Hey there, Humplings!

It’s a good idea to lead your partner into a matter-of-fact conversation about the importance of being sexually responsible, and then end it with a nice, traditional Hallmark card, tossing in a casual “P.S. Let’s make sure our baby-makers stay as sweet and sexy as you are — let’s go get tested today.”</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">Your partner hasn’t ever struck you as the shy type, so you know there’s room to shake things up this year. She or he would appreciate a few typical Valentine’s festivities, so include these things among your plans to drive to the nearest testing location and tell your partner you’ve “kind of” made plans to have a threesome with the hottest physician in the STI clinic.</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">The crazier the better. Your partner appreciates your creativity and gets off on a good surprise. Catch them off guard this year with a scavenger hunt that ends at the health clinic with this sort of a poem: “Your handcuffs are red, my KY is blue, let’s get our junk checked out today, because I care about you.” Let’s hope the surprises end there this Valentine’s Day.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i> The Sexperts are watching.

And being as open as I am, all eyes were on me when it came to rehashing our weekend adventures — the good, the quick and the ugly.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the quality, I was always open to talk sex with my friends because sex in college and during our adolescent years can be fantastic (worth talking about) or it can be downright hilarious due to the general lack of experience (perhaps even more worthy of rehashing). If you get pleasured right, you’ll want the world to know too, trust me. And if you’re getting pleasured wrong (aka, not pleasured at all), all you want to do is laugh about “That One Time When…” Basically, I always felt that talking sex gave me the opportunity to turn a terrible experience into a funny one.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are some things one should keep to themselves, and most people know right away when that line is being crossed. For example, one of the basic rules I like to stick to is never, ever demean anyone; we all have bad sex sometimes, but that’s no excuse for talking shit. However, when it’s casual, why not discuss it with friends? I am a female, and the last thing I want to be is called a “slut” or to feel shame-faced when people realize I am not the Virgin Mary. I love who I am, and every person should; loving your sexuality is okay! Sex can be fun and pleasurable — most of the time — but if you feel ashamed to be doing it, don’t do it. Just don’t judge a person for loving their sex life, because different things work for different people.</p>\n<p>Talking about it isn’t for everyone, but it really does help to have a person that you trust to talk about stuff. It keeps the head in balance and keeps the mind free of all of the worries that a one-night stand can bring. Sometimes, it’s as simple as needing your best friend to reassure you (even falsely) that the guy or girl from last night was a definite 10. And sometimes, your conversations can delve as deep as exploring your sexuality further, or talking out any problems that have arisen in the bedroom with a third party.</p>\n<p>Essentially, being able to talk about sex with someone can not only give you peace of mind, but can also give you insight into expanding your sexual horizons. Communication is key, so stop let’s judging and start conversing.</p>\n<p><em>Wendy Doer wants to talk about sex, baaaaby.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, April 9, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

However, there is always the big question that takes up residence in my head when I’ve just had an enjoyable night — do I stay or do I go? As a girl with intimacy issues, my head is almost always saying “GO,” but let’s explore the pros and cons of both sides.</p>\n<p>After a one-night stand, the last thing I want to do is wake up to a person I’ve just met, so of course, I usually tend to do the whole, “sneak out as soon as he’s asleep” thing. Because no matter how much fun you just had, no one really wants to do the walk of shame — well, I know I don’t. The problem with the Walk of Shame is that the better you looked the night before, the more embarrassing your walk home will be in the morning. By the light of day, that little black dress and the remnants of a smoky eye will have you praying that rather than recognizing you, people will just mistake you for a confused I.V. raccoon. By the way, guys, you have no idea how good you have it.</p>\n<p>However, I’ve also had times where I’ve had to stay the night, simply because the sex was so good that walking home afterwards didn’t seem possible without falling asleep halfway home, or because the prospect of calling a CSO to pick me up from my booty call just seemed like it’d be too awkward. But for this situation, lemme recommend you turn that Walk of Shame into a Stride of Pride, no matter what the night before was like. Own that messy hair and makeup. Walk down DP rather than shrinking down Sabado or Trigo. Heck, go take advantage of the Walk of Shame special at South Coast Deli.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So when you’re dealing with one-night stands or casual hookups, it seems that there will always be the inevitable questions of, “How do I ask them to leave without being rude?” or, “How do I let them know that I want them to spend the night?” Well, I think I can safely say that I have been on either side of both encounters: having to ask a person to leave my bed, inviting him to stay, knowing when it’s time for me to leave, being asked to stay and not wanting to, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>For someone who struggles with intimacy issues, the question of how to nicely kick someone out is too real. I know that I hate it when a guy attempts to spend the night in my bed; it’s already too small for me, so what makes you think I’d want to share it with you? So how does one kick a person out? For one, don’t be afraid to voice how you feel. This is your bed and if you want it to yourself, that’s your prerogative. But obviously, you want to try to drive them away in the most respectful manner possible; you never know when you might want to hit them up again. When in doubt, the simple, “I’m really tired and I have an early day tomorrow; the last thing I’d want to do is wake you up early,” usually works like a charm. We college students really value our sleep.</p>\n<p>But if you want the best chances of sleeping in your own bed without having to share it, I shall quote the wise words of YG: “Toot It and Boot It.” Maybe having your prize of the night go back to your place isn’t actually the smartest idea — go to theirs so you can sneak out without the guilt of feeling terrible for asking them to leave. Sex is fun (hopefully), but if you don’t want to stay the night, get out. The last thing I want for a partner is for them to feel forced to stay the night just because I had sex with them. I know that cuddling is fun for some, but you might as well save that for your body pillow because I’m not interested.</p>\n<p>And then there are the problems that come with dating a person for a while: taking it slow, and finally deciding to sleep together. Do you stay or do you go? Most people would say stay, obviously; you’ve been dating them, so why not? Yeah, I see where you’re coming from, but that’s not me. As previously mentioned, I like my bed to myself. And even if I’m dating a guy, getting me into bed is one thing but getting me to stay is wholly another. I say this because as a woman, it takes a lot for me to look my best and if I’ve just started dating you, I only want you to see me when I’m a 10. Therefore I can’t stay the night — while bedhead and last night’s makeup look good on some, as I’ve mentioned before, I feel that I tend to look less than desirable the morning after. Furthermore, I don’t see a problem with not wanting to spend the night with a partner — who wants to wake up with their morning breath in your face or their snoring loudly in your ear? As cynical as this may sound, I do believe that there’s nothing more exhilarating than caring about a person and exposing yourself to them. But until we get to that point in our relationship, I’m not interested.</p>\n<p>So, while the perks of dating a person can include being truly honest and intimate with your partner (including about how bad you look the next morning), the perks of one-night stands are not caring about leaving after the deed has been done. So yes, sometimes a sacrifice has to be made in order to expand your sexual horizons, but the thrill of leaving a freshly worn-out bed can be oh so fun. So let me enjoy myself and let me pleasure you, and then let us part our ways because I don’t want to wake up to you; sorry ’bout it.</p>\n<p><em>Wendy Doer has nothing but sympathy for the raccoons of Isla Vista.</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
