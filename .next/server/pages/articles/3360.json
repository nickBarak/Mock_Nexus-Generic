Strikers at UCSC have been calling for a cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) of $1,412 a month, according </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">payusmoreucsc.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the website for the UCSC strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As early as September 2019, organizers as part of the GSA, UAW2865, and from across campus have been calling for a Cost of Living Adjustment. The demand has been repeatedly presented to UCSC administration without equivocations,” the campaign wrote on its website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COLA of $1,412 a month was calculated to bring “every graduate student, regardless of residence, visa, documentation, employment or funding status…. Out of rent burden; and To parity with grad students at UC Riverside,” according to the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students have refused to upload grades to Canvas — a learning management website similar to Gauchospace — since Dec. 9, 2019, the first official day of their strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB Graduate Student Association passed </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iEd_O-dZ_KCut7HQHeEHoxHLlOwbCxkyZngRN1VaD5Y/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a resolution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of the UCSC strike at its  general meeting on Jan. 14, stating “unequivocally [their] full support for [their] fellow graduate students at UC Santa Cruz in their demand for a cost of living adjustment (COLA), including their engagement in a Wildcat Strike.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC strike is a “wildcat” strike, meaning that it does not have union approval.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The vast majority of graduate students spend more than half of their paychecks on housing, with many going to extreme lengths to make ends meet,” the resolution continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Santa Cruz grads’ decision to withhold grades is a brave and an ingenious use of our power as graduate students. The UC only works because we do, and our compensation should both reflect the value of our labor and account for the high cost of living in California.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB 4 COLA, the advocacy group calling for a COLA for UCSB graduate students, began circulating an FAQ regarding the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-GnQx0HSjGBotw6WJoBn34oxs3gYuXVbwbtCo3MdPUo/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sick-out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ckhIm4A2rCsKdbzlDcP6WyQ_aHPZkGhdFj58NN2Ti8/edit?fbclid=IwAR1jGycg1x3IvhGiGUw8wASVrMWTSf3_n5_zfj-fOUxPMaYzFtSTfPO-Vvs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a whole, stressing that Wednesday’s action was not a formal strike but instead the beginning of “a COLA movement of [their] own.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will collectively draft a list of demands to give administration, and if those demands are not met, then we will discuss the possibility of a strike with the graduate student body,” UCSB 4 COLA wrote in the COLA FAQ. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will not pursue a strike unless we decide that it is a necessary action and graduate students support escalation of that sort </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there will be plenty of opportunities to express your opinions on the matter each step of the way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sheila Kulkarni, a Ph.D student at UCSB and an organizer with UCSB 4 COLA, said that UCSB graduate students decided to engage in the sick-out in part due to their own struggles with the cost of living in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On average, UCSB graduate students put 48% of their income toward rent, putting them within just a few percentage points of the 50% threshold considered “severe rent burden” by the Office of Housing and Urban Development, according to a survey taken by the UCSB Graduate Student Association last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea would be a disruption of regular classroom activity,” Kulkarni said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students, on average, would need an additional $1133.57 for their rent to equal 30% of their income, according to an informal UCSB GSA survey, which Kulkarni said measured roughly 500 of the 2,906 graduate students. That survey also measured that UCSB graduate students make on average $2091.98 a month.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ahead of the sick-out, UCSB 4 COLA held a meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss logistics regarding Wednesday’s demonstration, such as what route the march would take, what signs to make, what slogans to chant and what committees to create. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Wednesday’s demonstration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kulkarni emphasized that UCSB graduate students must be the ones to decide whether or not to engage in further labor actions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really up to everyone if they want to go on strike, it’s not something the GSA can decide,” Kulkarni said. “It’s something all grad students have to decide.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/","id":3360,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[3359,3358,3357],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil","biography":"Not available","articles":[1818,1824,1826,1920,1932,1943,1963,1965,3301,3326,3360,3366,3367,3390,3448,3463,4003,4015,4026,4058,4084,4237,4238,4288,4301],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UC Regents Postpone Tuition Vote After Students Raise Concerns","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Harvest-Keeney-PRINT-3-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Harvest-Keeney-PRINT-3-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UC Regents will discuss two different potential models of tuition hikes at its Wednesday meeting.

UC Student Association (UCSA) President Varsha Sarveshwar said that the UC Regents are required to give students and UCSA notice at least 30 days ahead of time if they are considering a tuition increase — in this instance, Sarveshwar said her organization was “not explicitly told that [the Regents] would be considering a tuition increase of five years.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re entitled to this period of notice; we don’t feel like we received it,” she said, noting that, to the Regents’ credit, they “took those concerns seriously and said, ‘You know, you’re right.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re happy to see these concerns taken into account … It’s a small victory,” Sarveshwar added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSA “oppose any efforts to increase the tuition burden on individual students,” and circulated </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fe29yE-QD6Tq_l8_EvlHELKp23fB7_lAsMrFQlDEsXc/edit?fbclid=IwAR0gNd3FtIkXZ7ycGnGD1dsZGkS52DDoTsbPUDsOf80sHH9b5-Nm2eHTxrA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ahead of the three-day Regents meeting, lasting from Jan. 21 to Jan. 23.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition brings up several concerns about the tuition models, noting that a cohort-based tuition model would drastically affect non-residents who receive no financial aid and that the model relies on guaranteed funding from the state of California, which could be “extremely difficult to maintain when state revenues begin to fall.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In an economic downturn, the UC may be forced to increase tuition unfairly on incoming students, or abandon the model altogether,” the petition states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the petition, UCSA also encouraged students to attend the Regents meeting  to voice their concerns.

All that and the draft doesn’t even really improve parity of a league that has seen many of the same teams make the playoffs year in and year out.</p>\n<p>Under the rules of the NFL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement, rookies are the best deals in the league. That’s because their contracts are constrained by the rookie wage scale, which keeps their first-year salaries artificially low so teams could get a great investment.</p>\n<p>Per the terms of the CBA, each team has a rookie pool it can spend on its draft picks, with the size of the pool descending as the picks get lower. Spotrac estimates that the Browns will only be able to offer the first overall pick a contract worth a total of $30 million over four years.</p>\n<p>That’s a whole lot less compared to former first overall pick Sam Bradford’s $76 million contract given to him by the then St. Louis Rams after drafting him in 2010, which is, understandably, upsetting to this year’s pick (Myles Garrett, if the Browns are smart) since he would earn probably double without the rookie wage scale.</p>\n<p>In fact, the rookie wage scale only exists because teams went overboard with their rookie deals prior to its implementation, such as in the case of Bradford, who only spent four years in St. Louis throwing for only 11,065 yards, 59 touchdowns and 38 interceptions for a very average 80.1 quarterback rating.</p>\n<p>This wage scale makes it so that rookies are the most cost-effective commodities in the NFL. Oakland Raiders defensive end Khalil Mack, for instance, who won the Defensive Player of the Year award last season, is still on his rookie deal, a four-year contract worth $18 million, per Spotrac. Von Miller, the player Mack beat out for DPOY last season, currently has a six-year $114.5 million contract. In 2017, Mack provided the Raiders with Von Miller-level production for just 15 percent of the price.</p>\n<p>No wonder teams like the Browns choose to tank. Only through the draft can teams find elite talent that costs as much as a middling veteran.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the draft system, NFL teams have a strong incentive to tank in order to secure a high pick. In my mind, any system that encourages losing is a broken system that requires major reformation.</p>\n<p>That reformation doesn’t have to be complicated. In fact, it’s as easy as simply making incoming players free agents and creating a set rookie-free agency period.</p>\n<p>This change would wipe out any incentive to lose and would allow all teams to compete to sign the best rookie talents. There would be no rookie wage scale to artificially depress the wages of players like Khalil Mack and players would at last have the ability to choose where they want to start their careers.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the new rookie system would work like college recruiting. Teams, starting with the opening of the rookie-signing period, would work to court the top rookies of each class with fat contracts and promises of playing time, and each player would be able to choose from a variety of suitors.</p>\n<p>The existing salary cap would still be in place to act as a restriction on any one team’s ambitions during the rookie free-agency period.<br>\nSure, the Cowboys might be able to attract more rookie interest than other teams, but they’d only be able to sign as many top rookies as they could fit under the salary cap.</p>\n<p>Bad teams like the Browns would still have somewhat of an advantage in the new order, given their large amounts of cap space. All that space would come in handy when competing for the top rookies. Myles Garrett might love Texas, but that doesn’t mean he’s going to turn down additional tens of millions of dollars the Browns or 49ers can offer him.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the new rookie system would prioritize and reward smart teams.</p>\n<p>There are undervalued gems like Julian Edelman and Antonio Brown in every draft, players who in the new system would be available for cheap. While the Cowboys might go around pulling in one or two big names with big deals, other teams could snap up lots of these low-cost, high-value players. It’s what the Patriots and Steelers have been doing for years.</p>\n<p>Shifting from a draft to a rookie free-agency period would be a massive, but necessary, shift. It’s high time that the NFL and the NFLPA give rookies some actual power upon entering the league.</p>\n<p>Abolishing the draft would do that while simultaneously eliminating losing incentives in the NFL. That’s a win-win, and it won’t come at the cost of the NFL’s treasured parity.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 27, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

Now define the term “tradition” and the same process follows a loose-ended description of carrying on beliefs from one generation to the next.</p>\n<p>We’ve seen moments in sports where the two components infuse together and create a masterpiece. The Brady-Belichick era, the John Wooden dynasty, the “Core Four” Yankees and more are all relevant examples that permeate the mind when it comes to building a tradition of success.</p>\n<p>But what about the teams that don’t get the same spotlight as these prominent professional dynasties but still deserve to be in this conversation of greatness? Are there other cases of success and tradition that move beyond the noteworthy teams we have come to know and praise? This is the case for Head Coach Geno Auriemma and the UConn Huskies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Achieving success has never been an easy feat when it comes to any sport, but for Auriemma, it has evolved into a fundamental piece of his program. The American Athletic Conference coach has a proven winner with 979 career wins, 28 NCAA Tournament appearances and 11 national championship titles under his belt.</p>\n<p>Just as of Monday night, Auriemma and the Huskies’ program made history by winning their 100th-straight game, which continued UCONN’s longest streak in NCAA basketball history ever.</p>\n<p>The Huskies took down South Carolina 66-55 Monday night. Securing their niche in history, Auriemma and his Huskies continue to reinvent a culture of basketball that is the epitome of longevity for over two decades as the result of one element: winning.</p>\n<p>During his 22 years in Connecticut, Auriemma has crafted some of the finest female athletes to ever hit the hardwood floor. His ability to develop players and help them reach the next level has helped create four Rookie of the Year award winners, nine All-Stars and 12 WNBA champions over the span of 18 years.</p>\n<p>Stars such as Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, and Maya Moore flourished during their collegiate time in Harry A. Gampel Pavilion and under Auriemma, but more importantly, they’ve been able to transfer a winning culture over to their respective WNBA teams.</p>\n<p>As a result, there is no doubt the Huskies’ 2006 enshrinement into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame was well beyond well-deserved. However, the problem remains that Auriemma continues to be overshadowed by the celebrated teams of professional sports.</p>\n<p>Is there a reason the eight-time AP Coach of the Year lacks recognition when commemorating current coaching legends like Gregg Popovich and Belichick? Could this lack of appreciation be due to the polarized attitudes toward intercollegiate athletics and women’s sports? Whatever the case may be, Auriemma has accomplished multiple achievements, specifically his most recent, that are worthy of some praise.</p>\n<p>In an interview with “Good Morning America” co-host Robin Roberts, Auriemma stated, “I try to tell these kids they’re already part of history. No one can ever take that away from them, and all they can do is continue to add to it.”</p>\n<p>Numbers and accolades only paint a small portion of the picture for Geno Auriemma. As a man with excellence at the core of his program, Auriemma can be reasonably justified as his own placement as one of the greatest coach’s in sports history ever.</p>\n<p>His presence as a teacher and role model is one that uniquely connects with a younger generation of college athletes striving to create their own legacy of dominance.</p>\n<p>Auriemma’s time at UConn and current 100-game win streak for the school will be internalized as an unforgettable moment in sports. His efforts stand as a reflection, revision, and redefinition of what a “winning tradition” consists of. Success and tradition can come in many forms; this year’s Huskies are proof of that.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75765\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75765\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/","id":3359,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[3358,3357,3356],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
