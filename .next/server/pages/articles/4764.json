SB 186 amends Section 76034 of the California Education Code, which currently states that on community college campuses, “No student shall be removed, suspended, or expelled unless the conduct for which the student is disciplined is related to college activity or college attendance.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said her bill is a response to concerns voiced by community college students and representatives, who she continuously consulted while writing SB 186.</p>\n<p>“In doing this bill, I was listening carefully to concerns that were expressed by, particularly, our own community colleges both in Santa Barbara and in the other parts of the district, which were very concerned about the limited scope of their ability to discipline,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>SBCC President Lori Gaskin said the bill would provide an important resource for the college to police its student body.</p>\n<p>“Senator Jackson and I have talked about areas that provide options for California community colleges to ensure the standards of student conduct are understood and honored,” Gaskin said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the bill would hold Isla Vista residents who attend SBCC to the same behavioral standards already enforced on UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We have students who live in Isla Vista who are given a pass for behavior that subjects our university students to some kind of disciplinary action,” Jackson said. “There’s really no excuse in my opinion for allowing a pass to someone for this kind of egregious behavior while other students are subject to discipline.”</p>\n<p>However, Gaskin also said while she is glad Jackson authored the bill, it is “bittersweet” that the legislation is necessary to maintain student discipline and that there are better ways to encourage good behavior.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like engaging my students in a negative way,” Gaskin said. “I like engaging them in a positive way — making them aware of our expectation that they’re scholars first and foremost and that they are pursuing this gift of higher education.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Robert Plastino said SB 186 would help law enforcement maintain safety in areas surrounding campuses by including community colleges in that process.</p>\n<p>“I believe that extended jurisdiction can have positive outcomes when it is used appropriately,” Plastino said. “I believe that the bill is a good start to empowering community colleges in their efforts to keep their students and neighboring communities safe.”</p>\n<p>Second-year SBCC undeclared major Daniela Hunt said she agrees with the general idea behind the bill, but expressed concerns about its potential for overreaches of authority.</p>\n<p>“If the student was in trouble for something drinking-related, it should not be the school’s concern and the student has a right to privacy,” Hunt said.</p>\n<p>Second-year SBCC engineering major Colin Andrews said he agrees with the idea of holding college students living in the same community to the same standard, even if they attend different schools.</p>\n<p>“I think the bill is good in that it will hold SBCC student[s] living in Isla Vista accountable to their school in the same way as their neighboring UCSB students,” Andrews said. “I just hope that authority would really only be used for serious crimes with victims.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said she recognizes the need for discipline but hopes students take the time to consider the consequences of their actions before the disciplinary process becomes necessary.</p>\n<p>“I like to ensure students recognize — from the get-go as freshman — that this is an important time of life,” Gaskin said. “There are reasonable expectations and standards of conduct that a reasonable person is expected to abide by in a college setting.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Students Debbie Fleming said it would be good for SBCC and UCSB students living in I.V. to have consistent rules.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista, where we have both UC and SBCC students living and socializing together, this new bill will help to create more consistent accountability and level the expectations and consequences for student residents,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>According to Fleming, the university strictly adheres to a code of conduct that is very similar to what SBCC would likely adopt similar policies if SB 186 is passed.</p>\n<p>“Our code of conduct allows us to exercise off-campus jurisdiction over physical abuse, sexual assault and sexual harassment, threats of violence or other conduct that threatens the health or safety of any persons,” Fleming said. “When serious and concerning behavior is brought to our attention, either by community members or law enforcement, we will investigate and pursue a conduct case that could be forwarded to the appropriate Conduct Committee for a hearing.”</p>\n<p>Jackson, who co-authored California’s recent “Yes Means Yes” bill with Senator Kevin de Leon, said this bill is part of her long-standing commitment to addressing sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“It identifies certain behaviors that are deemed to be egregious, and sexual assault is one of them,” Jackson said. “I have talked to some women’s groups who have also been supportive of the concept.”</p>\n<p>Hunt said she thinks SB 186 would increase accountability for perpetrators of sexual assault, creating a sense of security for students.</p>\n<p>“If the school is notified of those students it will definitely add a layer of protection because the community will feel safer knowing that the perpetrator is punished or under investigation,” Hunt said. “The school should investigate in that case and make sure that the student is guilty, and if so the school should be notified and take necessary actions.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Taxation will fund I.V. public services including improved lighting and a parking program, among others.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61226\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61226\" data-attachment-id=\"61226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/das-williams-discussing-the-bill-with-a-community-member/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424480668\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"97\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61226\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1-683x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Assemblyman Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.

Attendees also favored the possible implementation of a parking program to generate additional revenues, as well as the establishment of a rental-tenant mediation board to sort out issues between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>Utilities taxable under most models presented at the meeting include water, internet, cable, gas and trash with special exemptions to low-income families under certain models.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill language includes powers for a CSD to contract for additional public safety services such as community service officers; a rental housing mediation task force; a municipal advisory council, which would allow the CSD to advise the county on additional policy for I.V.; and an area planning commission similar to one existing in Montecito.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee (SBCC) and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the three most likely types of tax for I.V. students and residents are a utilities tax; a creative sales deliveries tax, which refers to marijuana dispensary delivery taxes; and parcel taxes, which tax properties and are primarily used to fund public education.</p>\n<p>“I think what was presented here were great,” Abboud said. “The ideas were helpful and I think the utilities tax will be the number one idea and we should definitely have that one. The creative sales deliveries tax will be good as well, which involves marijuana. A small parcel tax will also work.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the marijuana tax could be beneficial for I.V. residents because many users and non-users alike favor taxing marijuana for city revenue.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, a marijuana tax came up a lot and the utilities tax is the most popular,” Williams said. “Marijuana advocates believe that it should be taxed and it seems like they mean it; this would also help students out. It can also be paid for.”</p>\n<p>Coffee Collaborative owner Steve McDonough said he does not support the utilities tax, which charges utility users for consumption of electricity, gas, water, sewer, telephone, sanitation and cable television. According to McDonough, he would have to spend more money on necessary utilities to keep his coffee business afloat.</p>\n<p>“I do not like the utilities tax,” McDonough said. “I own a coffee shop and I use so much utility every day. A utilities tax raise would cost me more money.”</p>\n<p>McDonough also said he does not see the reason behind transient taxes, a tax aimed at out-of-towners who stay at a hotel or motel, because there are no hotels in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As for the transient tax, we do not even have any hotels in Isla Vista so I do not see the point in transient taxes,” McDonough said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he believes the proposed party registration tax is not a “real” tax because it is not implemented anywhere else.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61229\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61229\" data-attachment-id=\"61229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/community-members-brainstorm-ideas-for-service-funding/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Community Members brainstorm ideas for service funding.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424482130\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000125\",\"title\":\"Community Members brainstorm ideas for service funding.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61229\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4-683x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Community members, such as Jay Freeman, above, brainstorm ideas for service funding.

Tuesday night’s meeting focused on the issue of amending CA AB-3 to include a specific governance plan for I.V. self-governance. <em>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista community members met Tuesday night for the weekly stakeholders meeting, held by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office, last night at the I.V. Clinic on 970 Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>Attendees strategized ways to get more input from residents regarding current and prior self-governance discussions and deliberated the May 15 deadline for an amended AB3 bill to include legal language addressing the need for self-governance in I.V. Currently AB3, introduced into the assembly by Williams, cannot be voted upon because it lacks explicit directions for the way I.V. will to be governed.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and longtime resident Pegeen Soutar said the approaching deadline to provide specific legal language in a month is unrealistic and “overwhelming.”</p>\n<p>“I am really uncomfortable trying to come up with something in one month,” Soutar said. “It is hard for us to get our heads around and I can’t even imagine the general public who have not been sitting in on these meetings. I don’t think we have all the facts yet. The idea of having something tangible by May is overwhelming to me.”</p>\n<p>Local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman said he was disappointed in the turnout at the town hall, due to both the low attendance number and lack of older community members.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised at how few people came. At previous town hall meetings a very large number of people have come,” Freeman said. “The previous town halls had a lot of older people, and at this meeting there were very few older people, it was almost all students. I was really surprised at the massive change.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, residents should be informed of the discussion topics before the meeting for future town halls.</p>\n<p>“It might have been really interesting to have had in the documentation that was sent out specifying what kind of things were going to be talked about, one of which being a community center,” Freeman said. “Because then people might have thought, ‘Oh, that’s a thing I care about.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60712\" style=\"width: 352px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60712\" data-attachment-id=\"60712\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/isla-vista-stakeholders-meeting-02102015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=4928%2C3264&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4928,3264\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting 02\\/10\\/2015.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423565074\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0666666666667\",\"title\":\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting 02\\/10\\/2015.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting Das Williams\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60712\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=342%2C226\" alt=\"Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus\" width=\"342\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60712\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I.V. community members listen at Tuesday night’s stakeholders meeting. <i>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Attendees at Tuesday’s meeting discussed how to better understand the needs of the community, particularly those of long-term renters and Latino families. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said Associated Students provides an I.V. Survey to gauge community opinions.</p>\n<p>“There’s an Associated Students in Isla Vista survey that deals directly with which services people would like to see,” Schunk said. “If we’re talking about biases and skewing results there is a large possibility that it is skewed because the survey is from the perspective of the student asking what services Associated Students can provide.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the EVPLA office is attempting to take into account the sentiments of Latino families and community members in addition to students in the self-governance process.</p>\n<p>“That survey obviously is limited in scope, but that outreach is largely from my office targeting Latino families and community members and so we’re trying to wrap that into this outreach,” Schunk said. “That’s a slow-going process, a lot of what we’re encountering is a lack of trust amongst community members in Associated Students, which has been around for a long, long time. We’re working to alleviate that.”</p>\n<p>Community organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said a professional firm will conduct a new fiscal study to better illuminate if and how I.V. could raise revenue to address community needs.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing a financial feasibility study by a professional firm,” Elliott said. “That’s going to give us a lot of the hard numbers, so these conversations are mostly educational and starting to get feedback and peoples’ general thoughts on it but obviously when we get those hard numbers that’s what’s going to mean the most.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said determining which services are needed in I.V. and how to pay for those services are an integral component of the self-government process.</p>\n<p>“That’s the critical thing in this whole process — finding out what services are lacking and how much is being spent at the level they’re at,” Gould said, “Where do we want that level to be and how much more is that going to take. Put a price tag on each one of those services, figure out what we want as a community and then pick and choose the services we’re going to spend our money on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/","id":4763,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4762,4761,4760],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
