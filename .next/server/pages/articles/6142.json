It’s worth doing some fact checking.<br>\nBecause this proposed measure bans only future<i> </i>well treatment options — specifically just the three most dangerous and carbon-intensive — we should all be clear on this: Measure P will not directly affect existing jobs or tax revenue for our community. It’s easy to pin the wellbeing of our schools or our critical fire and public safety services against this proposed measure, but only if you aren’t committed to remaining truthful.</p>\n<p>Currently, the countywide oil industry — that is, any and all oil extraction techniques — account for just 1% of local jobs and GDP, including indirect impact. This doesn’t account for the negative effects on tourism and decreased property values housing can experience in proximity to oil extraction. And yet, it can’t be stressed enough that because Measure P doesn’t apply to current oil production, none of this tax revenue is relevant to the debate. We caution you not to slip into big oil’s insidious farce.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of the oil extracted in our county is of too low a quality to be converted into any sort of energy product, and is thus turned into asphalt.</p>\n<p>Measure P is a ban on “well stimulation treatments,” specifically, cyclic steam injection, acidization and fracking: three separate techniques, but the same in one crucial way. These treatments all require pumping massive amounts of water underground (worst drought in 50 years anyone?) to stimulate the fossil fuel reserve and coax oil out of the ground.  The by-product of this process is an impressive amount of toxic waste, waste that needs to be stored somewhere.  The current go-to place of storage is in underground injection wells — right next to our groundwater (the source of roughly half our drinking water).</p>\n<p>Back in July, the CA Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) shut down eleven injection wells and began investigations on nearly 100 others throughout the state out of concern for the sanctity of nearby groundwater. Earlier this month, the Center for Biological Diversity<a href=\"http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2014/fracking-10-06-2014.html\"> confirmed</a> that at least nine of these injection wells were disposing of wastewater directly into groundwater aquifers. Yes, you read correctly.  In nine<i> </i>locations across the state, groundwater was being directly infused with toxic waste.</p>\n<p>While it is true that at the moment there are no active fracking projects in Santa Barbara County, there are many cyclic steam injection sites which carry just as high a risk of toxic contamination.</p>\n<p>Measure P will serve to protect our economy, not hurt it.  But don’t take my word for it.  Go educate yourself — look into the truth about the facts, then get back to me.</p>\n<p><em>This letter has been submitted on behalf of Gauchos Against Fracking </em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

At the end of the election season, she was voted into the office of EVPLA.</p>\n<p>Since then, the Open People’s Party has rescinded Contreras’ party membership and has called for her resignation.

The allegations against Contreras came out in the middle of the Associated Students election season, and many students had already cast their votes. We think it is essential that students have the ability to vote only once all relevant information is available. For example, I had voted on the first day of the election, and I know that I personally would not have voted for a candidate with such serious allegations levied against her. Therefore, we believe that voters should be given the opportunity to vote again with all of the developments of these accusations in mind.</p>\n<p>We believe in supporting the testimony of survivors. As has been addressed many times during the last three weeks, studies have shown that only two to eight percent of survivors fabricate their testimonies. In the last month, Associated Students has been called out for contradicting its previous statement to support survivors when they come forward with their testimonies. We stand behind the previous statement, and feel that this is the appropriate legal action to take to both support the survivor and ensure that the student body is effectively represented by someone they can trust.</p>\n<p>Finally, we no longer feel that Contreras will have the ability to be an effective representative in her office. Her recent removal from the Open People’s Party, combined with her distance from both independents and the Democratic Process Party, makes it likely that she will lose a large basis of her support in Associated Students. These developments will impede her efforts to enact policy or address local issues.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the general discomfort that students face because of these accusations make it unlikely that she will be able to effectively raise awareness and address student concerns, particularly on issues surrounding sexual assault or sexual harassment. Both of these developments create a situation where Contreras will not able to build the coalitions and make the connections that are necessary to enact community building at UCSB and in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The decision to create this petition was not an easy one. We have worked with the Associated Students elections committee every step of the way to ensure its legitimacy. I and others have been constantly concerned that the circulation of this petition may seem like an attempt to vilify Contreras. After careful consideration, I can truthfully say that it is not. It is an attempt to give students the chance to re-vote for the office of EVPLA with all information considered, and it is an attempt to support the testimony of a survivor.</p>\n<p>If we reach the 514 signatures that are needed to enact the recall vote, it will not ensure that Contreras is removed from office. She will still have the opportunity to run again in the fall.</p>\n<p>However, it will give the UCSB community the opportunity to voice their concerns through the ballot. It will give the student body the agency that is needed to make an accurate, representative choice for our elected student government.</p>\n<p>No matter your opinions on the accusations that have come forward, I urge you to sign the petition. A recall is only the first step in the process. A re-vote will give students the chance to voice new considerations about their representatives. It will also give candidates and political parties the opportunity to reconvene and redefine their platforms.</p>\n<p>Please consider using your politically constituted agency to make a difference in regards to this contentious issue.</p>\n<p><em>Monte-Angel Richardson is a fourth-year political science and global studies major and a member of Associated Students.

Ecosocialism is not an attempt to piggyback and steal the momentum of the global movement aimed at mitigating climate change in order to push a “red” agenda. Rather, ecosocialism aims for an economic system based on human need and the reduction of the gross inequalities that exist everywhere today — the socialism part — and emphasizes the ecological through respect and stewardship of our natural environment and lessening the devastating impact of our economic activity on the very basis of life. Ecosocialism is a rebalancing of the world — transforming society to a more ecocentric worldview. With a systemic analysis, we understand the crises of social inequalities and environmental catastrophe as inextricably linked. In the current political economic system of capitalism, where profit is the highest goal attained by growth at all costs, we see mass social inequalities and a devastated climate as symptoms of a systemic malady.</p>\n<p>As ecosocialists, we do advocate public ownership of utilities. We believe communities should be able to control their common resources. We can look at water as an example. Access to water is a right and not a commodity. When resources are privatized, they are often mismanaged by corporations who also create monopolies and raise rates. This is a common story told across the globe, from the Cochabamba Water War against Bechtel in Bolivia to Detroit’s water crisis, where rates had risen 119% over the last decade. We need to be able to make the decisions that affect our lives, and we do this through democratizing the decision making processes so that we can create a world built upon fulfilling our needs.</p>\n<p>Of the many troubling claims made by Mr. Garshfield, the most worrying to our member, fourth-year CCS biology major Henry Morse, was the claim that “scientists should not be making economic prognoses at all.” To argue that scientists should remain in their labs and out of public discourse has long been a technique used to keep the reality of our society’s ills hidden away from the public. Can we imagine what our country would be like if scientists like Rachel Carson (,who illuminated the dangers of the pesticide DDT,) hadn’t left their labs to speak out about the societal consequences of their work? Monsanto, the largest agri-business operation in the world, is poisoning the planet just by following its business model of maximizing growth and profit at the expense of our health, the livelihoods of farmers the world over and the possibility of our children inhabiting a livable environment. Just ask Neil Young, who tells this story on his most recent album the Monsanto Years.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor John Foran, one of the gathering’s organizers and a member of the national System Change Not Climate Change ecosocialist network (and an ardent fan of Neil Young’s music and activism) is singled out as possessing “no background in economics. Why does Professor Foran feel qualified to advocate a radical systemic overhaul in a field he does not even study?” This is a fair question, on the surface. Foran’s response,: “Jason seems to believe that one needs a doctorate in economics to be a critic of capitalism, while at the same time noting, ‘To economists, the success of capitalism is at least as much of a consensus as the existence of global warming is among climate scientists. They might debate the minutiae, but the major points are not in doubt.’ The point today is that the climate crisis has been caused by the normal operation of capitalism. Why then should we look to pro-capitalist economists to fix it? It was the great radical economist Kenneth Boulding who famously wrote that ‘Anyone who believes that exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.’ Boulding was president of the American Economic Association and made contributions to sociology, political science, social psychology and philosophy as a contributor to the approach known as General Systems Theory.”</p>\n<p>Jason misunderstands the “tragedy of the commons” as a critique of collective ownership of a common good, when public control over common goods like fresh water, clean air and the land that sustains our food production is in fact the solution to this problem. The tragedy of the commons is a problem generated by each individual maximizing his or her private good, a central tenet of free-market capitalism. The socialist Albert Einstein himself said that maybe we shouldn’t fix a problem with the system that created it.</p>\n<p>Jason also asserts that “when a good is private, people will be careful not to deplete the resource on their own property, because costs will be incurred by the individual actor.” Yet the reason that we have an unprecedented environmental crisis on our hands is that corporations do not have to pay the full costs of their operation in terms of either resources depleted or toxic waste and greenhouse gases produced, costs which economists tellingly refer to as “externalities.” Ecosocialists, whether trained economists or not, see this devastation of the natural world as “the second contradiction of capitalism” (the first being the cruel incentive of employers to drive down wages as much as possible).</p>\n<p>Growth at all costs, regardless of its effects on our earth and collective health, is a cornerstone of global capitalism today. Just this past month, Volkswagen, the world’s largest automobile manufacturer, admitted to rigging emissions tests in over 11 million cars. Cars were installed with devices that would direct a car’s engine to emit less pollutants, 98 percent less, during a test. What does it mean if VW, ranked most sustainable car maker in the world, is rigging its vehicles to pass emissions tests they would otherwise fail? The bottom line is green consumerism will not save us when profit is the driving force.</p>\n<p>We can argue that this is a case of a few greedy executives, some “bad apples,” but the case of green-washing (creating a false environmentally-conscious image by appropriating environmental concern to expand markets) can be seen across industries, including, most absurdly, the fossil fuel corporations that are the largest and richest the world has ever seen. And recently, ExxonMobil has been found to have <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/10/16/solo-arrest-bill-mckibben-spotlights-exxons-unparalleled-evil\">lied to the public</a> for years when its own scientists told its executives of the dangers of climate change.</p>\n<p>How do we start the desperately needed transition into a more just and sustainable system that rejects all socially and ecologically destructive systems, like patriarchy, racism, homophobia, transphobia and capitalism? What are the local measures we can take? How do we build people power and reclaim the right to make the decisions that affect our communities? These questions and others will be discussed at meetings of the UCSB System Change Not Climate Change group.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in these questions send an email to scnccsb@gmail.com for info on our next meeting. We invite Jason to attend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

400;\">for boys. It certainly seems like a fair comparison, in terms of the broad strokes: they’re both wish-fulfillment stories featuring Mary Sue protagonists falling into unintentionally disturbing romances. Ernest Cline’s debut novel has been derided not only for this, but its masturbatory self-references — one infamous passage circulating around the web highlights a scene in which central character Wade Watts meticulously, uselessly lists off all the 80s-relevant accessories he’s added to his virtual DeLorean. (“’See? It’s an awful book!” the Internet cries.)  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s morbidly amusing to consider that Steven Spielberg directed an adaptation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twilight </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for boys</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then I read how his wife Kate Capshaw convinced him to do it after listening to the audiobook, which reminded me that despite its flaws, the book still speaks on some level to the people who lived through the time period that the book and its subsequent film heavily pull from: the 80s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that aspect of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready Player One </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is significantly toned down in the film in favor of emphasizing video games. Although big 80s musical hits are peppered throughout the soundtrack, the film is less about celebrating neon and big hair than about cramming as many video game characters on-screen as possible. Look! It’s Sonic! And Tracer! And…the Arkham Knight? Seriously? Who the hell’s going to be cosplaying as that overhyped disappointment in 2045?</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t get distracted by these constant references, though. If you’re looking for a certain character you love to show up, you’ll be scanning the screen incessantly and completely miss the plot. Besides, if you’re hoping for the camera to linger for more than five seconds on a recognizable figure from pop-culture that’s not a giant robot, guess what? Yeah.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right, now that that’s out of the way, time to address the story and characters. As Wade explains over more exposition than ought to be acceptable, it’s the future. And the future sucks. To escape said suckage, people escape into a massive online virtual reality called the Oasis, created by the awkward James Halliday (played by recent Spielberg collaborator Mark Rylance). When Halliday dies, a posthumously-released video reveals that he’s hidden three keys inside the Oasis, and whoever finds them all and the Easter egg they unlock will inherit half a trillion in stock and get to control the Oasis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, everyone wants it: Wade, his best friend Aech (whose avatar is a hulking troll-like figure who has pylons and springs for intestines), resistance leader Art3mis and samurai partners Daito and Sho. They reunite in order to stop Electronic Ahem, I mean, Innovative Online Industries (IOI) from getting the egg first so they can bombard players with ads and micro-transactions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The characters as a whole get a noticeable upgrade from the book, to some degree. In the original book, Wade stalks Art3mis in a manner that’s supposed to be endearing, but is anything but. As a trade-off, we get a decidedly less creepy romance between the two… one that develops across a couple days. It’s stupid in Disney movies and it’s still stupid if Spielberg does it. As a result, Art3mis’ insistence that their online relationship isn’t genuine because they’ve never met — the only thing this story has going for it in terms of thematic relevance — seems a lot more like she’s trying to hide the fact that she’s got a port-wine stain on her face instead of a genuine critique of VR’s pitfalls. Well, poo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can’t say much about Aech without spoiling a decent chunk of the plot, but I’m happy to see said character’s identity and background isn’t used to deliver the same hilariously awkward and forced commentary as the book. It’s also nice to see Daito and Sho get some increased importance, even though we come away knowing next to nothing about them and instead wondering how the hell it’s possible that all these pivotal characters seem to be living in Columbus, Ohio without ever meeting each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, and there’s the villains. Ben Mendelsohn’s fine. He’s a corporate dick, and he’s good at it. Although I can’t help but laugh at his main henchwoman, just because of her name: F’nale Zandor. And that’s her </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">name; we never see her in the Oasis. It’s like screenwriters Penn and Cline came up with a fantasy name on the spot and said to themselves, “That’s good, sounds scary!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All right, I’m going on a tangent here. What works? Well, the Oasis looks awesome. Everything looks real, but not </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real. It’s a borderline uncanny valley, which works for the film’s video-game setting. The beginning chase sequence involving the likes of the DeLorean, King Kong and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jurassic Park </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">T-rex is a masterwork of speed and destruction. The final battle is a lot of fun, although too short. As cool as it is to see giant robots fighting each other, for the love of God, if you’re going to show us the battle to save… the world? Don’t end it after 10 minutes and go on for another 20 after that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a feeling that, in the future, I will watch three sequences of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready Player One </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on YouTube: the initial race, the horror movie tribute scene and the final battle. Because all those parts are insanely fun, and everything else is as expendable as toenail clippings. Which really stinks, because there could have been a great story here, instead of boy-meets-girl blah. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Wehrung is very upset over the lack of </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloodborne </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">references.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/spielberg-dares-to-be-stupid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/spielberg-dares-to-be-stupid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/spielberg-dares-to-be-stupid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/spielberg-dares-to-be-stupid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/spielberg-dares-to-be-stupid/","id":6141,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[6140,6139,6138],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
