As a student, Macias said she believes that art is commodified and generally something people cannot enjoy unless they have excess funds to pay for expensive art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just look at romance painters,” Macias said. “They were always court painters. They did portraits for royalty. They did marble statues, they painted churches, so [art] has always been a commission-based thing and it has always been commissioned by higher classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This realization led Macias to research ways to share her art with the “broke college kids” around her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to make her art more accessible, Macias puts her art on stickers, with sizes to fit Hydroflasks and lighters, and she creates poetry and art for Um…Magazine, an online student-run publication.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias has fallen in love with the I.V. art community and is an artist who believes even college students should be able to appreciate art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that is what I really like about I.V. art movements. It is so inclusive,” said Macias. She found UCSB to be elitist when it comes to art projects, only allowing incredibly skilled artists to produce art around campus, yet I.V. is welcoming to all skill levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in her free time, Macias has taken up denim painting commissions – an unconventional art form not often seen in I.V. She charges between $20 and $35 for the art, depending on whether the buyer provides their own denim.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I like painting denim, not only because it is an easy way to get my art affordably out there, but also I feel like it makes my art mobile,” Macias explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend moving to Germany in July could not take acrylic paints with her onto the plane, so she gifted them to Macias a couple months before she left. Without a canvas and disliking the look of acrylics on paper, Macias painted on denim for the first time in the spring, adding flowers to her mother’s jacket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The denim jacket] was the coolest thing and it didn’t have any marks on it or anything. I had it all throughout high school,” Macias said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that painting on denim is surprisingly difficult in contrast to her familiar watercolors, which she considers to be the most forgiving medium due to water always being able to change the image.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with denim’s rough surface, the paint needs to be combined with a mixing medium and sealed with heat to make it last through a wash, and many layers of paint are needed to produce a bright color. Macias also found that her line work needs to be more precise with acrylics than with watercolors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias noticed that people were afraid to alter their own clothing but still wanted to have personalized art, which Macias said is why she chooses to create commission-based denim rather than selling original denim creations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People don’t feel like they have the time or the energy or skill to create something but that doesn’t mean they can’t. They just need other ways to get there and that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t reap the benefits of their own creative mind.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every girl has a pair of high-waisted jeans in their drawer,” Macias said. “Some of them are booty shorts, some of them are cut-off, but they all have some pair of high waisted denim shorts somewhere and it’s just like, ‘Why don’t you paint the back pocket?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She often encourages people to paint with her if they want to try it out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you feel like you could do that or you want to do that, then sit here and try it with me at least, and if we mess up, Livi can try to fix your shorts,” said Macias.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with Vincent van Gogh’s famous paintings “Starry Night” and “Café Terrace at Night,” Macias finds emotion to be an important part of art.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His most beautiful works were actually made when he was in recovery,” Macias explained. She added that she is troubled by society’s romanticization of mental illness and creation and finds many believe Van Gogh and other celebrated creators would not have been as gifted or talented without their mental illnesses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He portrays entire emotions of happiness and hope in those just by the use of color,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her inspiration comes from whatever she is feeling at the moment with the paper she has on hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macias’ previous art pieces range across many emotions, from darker works about drug use and overdose to cuter, summer works with bright yellows and golds. She keeps various notebooks with each featuring a different theme, often with as many as twenty notebooks partially filled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Art is expression…and that’s what I really want to portray in what I do.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

ended their last home game series against Tulane on a high note with a victorious sweep and a winning home record of 4-3. Since then, however, UCSB lost four straight until finally pulling out a 10-8 win over BYU in the first game of the series.</p>\n<p>It then proceeded to drop both games of the doubleheader on Friday as well as the final game of the series on Saturday at Larry H. Miller Field in Utah, yielding an overall 5-10 season record.</p>\n<p>Heading into this weekend, UCSB had a dominating 7-1 lead over BYU in their match-up series. Both teams were visibly having slow starts to their 2017 seasons, UCSB starting the weekend with a record of 4-7 and BYU 4-6. The Cougars had been on the road for a tough 10 consecutive games and were eagerly eyeing a win in their home opener against the Gauchos.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB got on the board first on Thursday with two runs in the top of the second and another in the third, but BYU answered in their second inning at-bats with one run, continuously producing a run per inning until they led 4-3 by the bottom of the fifth.</p>\n<p>In the top half of the sixth, the Gauchos racked up three more runs to make it 6-4 and take the lead back from the Cougars. After sophomore designated hitter Sam Cohen touched home on junior third baseman Kenny Corey’s single to tie the game 4-4, BYU junior starting pitcher Maverik Buffo (1-3, 5.06 ERA) was relieved by junior lefty Rhett Parkinson (0-0, 4.50 ERA).</p>\n<p>However, this pitching change did not do much to adversely affect the Gauchos as they continued to get on base, scoring freshman center fielder Tommy Jew on a throwing error by BYU senior catcher Bronson Larsen and knocking in Corey on a sac-fly to the right from UCSB junior shortstop Clay Fisher.</p>\n<p>The Cougars bats did not stay quiet with a late surge in the seventh to make it a close one-run game once again. However, they were not able to retrieve the lead from the Gauchos, who remained hot at the plate, for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>The first game of Friday’s doubleheader started out optimistically for the Gauchos, who broke it wide open by putting up five runs in the top of the first. Their defense then retired the side in order in the bottom half for a successful first inning.</p>\n<p>UCSB junior starting pitcher Kyle Nelson (1-2, 5.30 ERA) gave up a two-run jack to BYU’s Larsen in the bottom of the second, and the scoreboard read 5-2 through a scoreless third and fourth innings.</p>\n<p>Nelson was pulled with one out in the bottom of the fifth after giving up another home run, a line drive doubles, and three singles that culminated into three runs for the Cougars to make it 5-5. Freshman RHP Shea Barry (0-1, 3.52 ERA) gave up one more single, allowing BYU to score another run and make it 6-5 Cougars before he retired the final two batters.</p>\n<p>UCSB urgently got a run back to tie it 6-6 in the top of the sixth. Redshirt junior catcher Dempsey Grover struck out swinging but reached first on an error from BYU freshman catcher David Clawson and scored on a triple from Fisher.</p>\n<p>Barry had a controlled one-two-three inning in the bottom half of the sixth to hold the score, but the Cougars defense had a three-up, three-down inning as well in the top of the seventh to keep the Gauchos in check. Then, in walk-off fashion, Cougars sophomore shortstop Daniel Schneemann homered to right field, tragically defeating UCSB 7-6 for BYU’s first win of the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had opportunities to capitalize throughout the game considering they left six runners on base, but their opportunities to score were cut short with the game only set to last seven innings.</p>\n<p>Matters worsened from there as UCSB carried Friday afternoon’s loss into the second game, losing in a 17-3 blowout that night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had three fielding errors, junior RHP Chris Clements (0-3, 9.42 ERA) allowed 13 runs in three innings, and freshman LHP Ben Brecht (0-0, 4.35 ERA) allowed six more in the fourth alone after relieving Clements before he finally halted BYU’s offense from getting on the board for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>The only three runs scored by UCSB were a home run from Fisher in the first and two unearned runs in the eighth on an error from BYU sophomore right fielder Brock Hale.</p>\n<p>The noon finale on Saturday was another high scoring game at 14-8 to the Gauchos demise, but not as merciless as Friday’s 17-3 nightcap.</p>\n<p>Saturday mirrored the first game of Friday’s doubleheader in that UCSB came out strong in the first inning, earning four, but their defense continued to give up more runs than their bats could generate and they suffered from three more fielding errors. Gauchos junior starting pitcher Steven Ledesma (0-2, 9.20 ERA) took the loss, giving up 10 runs over four and one-third innings.</p>\n<p>In a more positive light, UCSB continues to lead the BYU series now at 8-4, and despite Friday night’s defeat, the Gauchos offense seems to be alive and active. Certainly, their defense and pitching staff, in particular, have much to improve upon if they intend to win games and get back over .500.</p>\n<p>However, it is still early in the season with a plenty of baseballs left to play, meaning there is sufficient time to recover and develop as a team.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be back at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium for 11 successive games starting with this weekend’s series against Stony Brook University. The Gauchos return to their home turf should give them the confident advantage they need to make progress toward a winning season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76453\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/gauchos-road-woes-continue-with-series-loss-at-byu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76453\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/gauchos-road-woes-continue-with-series-loss-at-byu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/gauchos-road-woes-continue-with-series-loss-at-byu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/gauchos-road-woes-continue-with-series-loss-at-byu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-13/gauchos-road-woes-continue-with-series-loss-at-byu/","id":4144,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4143,4142,4141],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope To Outpace Cougar Pack While On The Road In Utah","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nexus_Baseball_SM-1-of-1-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It has been an uncharacteristic start for the UCSB baseball team as its looks to overcome last weekend's sweep heading into its series at BYU.

The Gauchos only have 11 doubles and zero triples, both bottom numbers in the Big West. However, the Gauchos are tied with Cal State University Northridge for second for most home runs in the Big West with seven. With these seven home runs, though, UCSB has only managed to score a total of 41 runs, 14 of which came in one game against Tulane on Feb. 25.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although these numbers are worrisome, it is important to note how early it is in the season. People forget this is still “Spring Training” for some college hitters.<br>\nAs more and more hitters find their rhythm and timing, the ’Chos will string together some great at-bats at a more consistent basis. After all, hits do come in bunches, and hitting is contagious.</p>\n<p>The Cougars’ pitching staff will provide a tough challenge for Gaucho hitters to get out of this slump, though. Cougar pitching has a pretty solid team ERA of 3.46, giving up only 35 earned runs total in ten games. With UCSB having a predominately lefty lineup, the six left-handed pitchers featured on the BYU roster will also give the Gauchos some trouble.</p>\n<p>The predicted starters that the Gauchos will face in this four-game series are RHPs senior Brady Coreless (2-0), junior Maverik Buffo (1-2), senior Kendall Motes (0-1) and potentially LHP junior Hayden Rogers (0-0). Coreless is the Cougar ace who owns an impressive 1.89 ERA with 23 strikeouts through 19.0 innings pitched.<br>\nThe other two right-handed starters, Buffo and Motes, have had much rougher outings recently as their respective ERAs of 4.50 and 5.14 show. Lefty Rogers will be tough if he gets his second start of the season. Rogers holds a 2.38 ERA with 11.1 innings and six strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The Cougar offense is also something not to glance over. Coming into the series, BYU will have five different hitters hitting above the .300 mark. Currently leading the Cougar offense is sophomore right fielder Brock Hale. Hale is hitting for both average and power with a .385 average, three doubles and two home runs on top of driving in nine runs.     Even though this offense looks strong on paper, they will face an even stronger Gaucho pitching staff.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s pitching staff has been the most reliable part of this year’s team. Sophomore starters Noah Davis (2-1) and junior Kyle Nelson (1-2) have been pitching exceptionally well with ERAs of 2.14 and 3.14. Still the third and fourth spots in the rotation are up for grabs.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Joe Record (0-1, 9.1 IP, 5.79 ERA), the typical Sunday starter for the ’Chos, was moved to the bullpen last week after having a couple rough outings. Junior Steven Ledesma (0-1 10.1, 5.23 ERA) was given the ball instead for his first ever start, but even after pitching impressively in the Gaucho bullpen, Ledesma was rocked, giving up five earned runs in 1.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Junior RHP Chris Clements (0-2, 11.1 IP, 3.18 ERA) is currently in position to take this third spot in the rotation with a decent outing against Saint Mary’s his last start, giving up only two earned runs.</p>\n<p>Still, either Record or Ledesma will make a start this weekend for the Gauchos with the four-game series.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how the Gauchos pitch, it will all come down to offense at the end of the series. UCSB will need to get runners on base and execute their signature West Coast Style Small Ball offense to get runs on the board. Aforementioned, if the Gauchos can string together a couple of good at-bats, an offensive fire could spark to the likes that we have already seen this year in the Tulane series.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76269\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76269\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/","id":4145,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

As stated before, hitting is contagious, and this group of guys could not have picked a better time to catch this fever as they head into conference.</p>\n<p>On top of a firing-on-all-cylinders offense, UCSB’s starters have been pitching with authority as well. Besides a rough outing from ace Noah Davis last weekend, starters Kyle Nelson, Chris Clements, and Ben Bretch are coming off their best outings of the year as they head into the series against the Dirt Bags.</p>\n<p>The only real concern is in every one of the great performances each ace threw their highest pitch counts of the season and went later into games than ever before.  Regardless, UCSB has all the momentum of both sides of the ball going into this series, which could turn out to be a difference maker throughout Big West play this year.</p>\n<p>However, the month of March was not all smiles for UCSB. The Gauchos will need to replace the productivity of the great junior shortstop Clay Fisher who is out for the year after undergoing Tommy John Surgery, and previous Sunday ace starter Joe Record.</p>\n<p>Despite the home team hosting this series with a ton of momentum on its side, Long Beach State is certainly has been producing as of late as well. In their past 10 games, Long Beach St. has gone 8-2 with a big win against No. 4 TCU and an even bigger series sweep of Cal State Fullerton whom were ranked 6</p>\n<p>In their past 10 games, LBSU has gone 8-2 including big victories against No. 4 TCU and an even bigger series sweep of Cal State Fullerton whom were ranked 6<sup>th</sup> in the country prior to those loses.</p>\n<p>With these statement-making victories, some may argue the Dirtbags have more going for them heading into this series against the Chos’, however, these people would be wrong. In fact, Long Beach St. has several things actually working against them this weekend that others might not see.</p>\n<p>During their past 10 games, five of LBSU’s eight wins have come from very close games with scores within at least two runs of each other. Each of these five wins could have gone either way, but to the Dirtbags credit, they know how to win close games with their entire team.</p>\n<p>Nobody in particular has been amazing. Regardless, the big three hitters to watch out for are Ramsey Romano (.360, 1 HR, 14 RBI), Lucas Tancas (.347, 2 HR, 11 RBI), and David Banueios (.312, 4 HR, 17 RBI) as these guys have been consistent all season long for the most part.</p>\n<p>For their starters, only one has an ERA below 4, which belongs to Junior RHP Darren McCaughan (3.48 ERA, 41.1 IP, 16 ER, 5 HR, 37 SO). The Dirt Bag’s pitching overall has been less than impressive.</p>\n<p>The away record for the Dirt Bags is something to be weary of as well. Long Beach is 5-9 on the road this year, while the Gauchos have held an impressive record at home of 8-3.</p>\n<p>But how about this, the most impactful part of this weekend’s matchup might not even have anything to do with the Gauchos. The Dirtbags have played a total of five games in five days. When they play UCSB? Well, that will be six games in six days. By the end of the series, Long Beach St. will have played eight games in eight days. Without a doubt, the Dirt Bags will be playing tired baseball. Their pitching staff is already heavily used up before this series even begins and their position players will be on heavy legs on defense and in the box. The scheduling and timing of this series</p>\n<p>By the end of the series, Long Beach St. will have played eight games in eight days and will without a doubt have a negative impact on Long Beach State. Their pitching staff is already heavily used up before this series even begins and their position players will be on heavy legs on defense and in the box. The scheduling and timing of this series is going to help out the Gauchos exponentially.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces LBSU to begin Big West conference play at 3 p.m. on Friday, March 31st at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76592\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/gauchos-trying-to-make-some-waves-in-conference-opener-against-dirtbags/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76592\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/gauchos-trying-to-make-some-waves-in-conference-opener-against-dirtbags/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/gauchos-trying-to-make-some-waves-in-conference-opener-against-dirtbags/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/gauchos-trying-to-make-some-waves-in-conference-opener-against-dirtbags/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-31/gauchos-trying-to-make-some-waves-in-conference-opener-against-dirtbags/","id":4146,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.
