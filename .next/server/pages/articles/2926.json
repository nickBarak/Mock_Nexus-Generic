Yesterday featured a discussion with Pacific Pride about advancements in HIV/AIDS, and today will include a student dialogue with QSU related to HIV/AIDS and sex traffic workers. Wednesday involves a campus-wide action to wear all black, and on Friday free and discrete HIV/AIDS testing will be provided in De Anza Resource Center.</p>\n<p>Second-year English major and BSU member Ricky Barajas said the overall goal of this week is to support QSU and address HIV/AIDS as a significant issue affecting both the LGBTQ+ community and the black community.</p>\n<p>“I think that it is very important to recognize the intersections between race and sexuality, because black people account for 12 percent of the population, but over 40 percent of infected people are black,” Barajas said. “BSU supports this event because of how our community is disproportionately affected, and also because we want to stand in solidarity with other organizations and people who are striving to educate and advocate for people affected by this issue.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>My hopes are that the consciousness surrounding HIV increases and that as Gauchos we can come together and make a difference. – Event host Saxon Cropper</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cropper said the weeklong event is meant to send a reminder that HIV/AIDS is an issue that impacts everyone within an afflicted community, both directly and indirectly.</p>\n<p>“My hopes are that the consciousness surrounding HIV increases and that as Gauchos we can come together and make a difference,” Cropper said. “We can learn to be more sensitive and finally learn to protect ourselves.”</p>\n<p>According to Cropper, because there is social stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS and a general lack of education on about it on campus, organizations hosting the event aim to eliminate the stigma and offer accurate information about it on campus.</p>\n<p>“By social stigma, I mean that within spaces, people have made HIV a social taboo,” Cropper said. “People should know that HIV is not a death sentence and that there are people living with HIV who are living healthy lives.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting informed is the most important factor for ensuring the longevity of students with or without AIDS. – First-year economics major Derrick Duren</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year feminist studies major and QSU co-chair Roger Gonzalez said the event provides an opportunity for the university to support victims of HIV/AIDS in addition to participating in the annual AIDS walk.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara has an annual AIDS walk, but UCSB doesn’t have anything to do with it so it’s important especially for college students because it’s important for us to be aware of it on our campus and help out those who do have HIV or AIDS,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year economics major Derrick Duren, the campus benefits from events like the HIV/AIDS Awareness Week because it supports community members who struggle with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.</p>\n<p>“This AIDS Awareness Week will be an amazing way to enlighten our student body to the reality of living with STIs,” Duren said. “Getting informed is the most important factor for ensuring the longevity of students with or without AIDS.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The fraternity seeks to establish a chapter on campus to appeal to pre-med students, despite the presence of Mu Delta, a pre-existing pre-med fraternity that has been on campus since 2011, as well as Rho Psi Eta, UCSB’s pre-health sorority, established 2007.</p>\n<p>According to Amy Tsang, Vice President of PhiDE Recruitment and second-year biopsychology major, the fraternity is unique because it is the only co-ed pre-medical organization on campus, differentiating it from all-male Mu Delta and all-female Rho Psi Eta, and includes pre-medical and medical school students.</p>\n<p>“We’re unique to UCSB in the way that we have medical school fraternities, as well as pre-medical school fraternities,” Tsang said in an email. “This means we have a strong alumni network, as well as tied to medical schools across the nation!”</p>\n<p>PhiDE president and third-year cell and developmental biology major Mimi Xu said the fraternity provides members benefits after graduation from college, including assistance in choosing a specialty and finding residency training.</p>\n<p>“We hope this fraternity prepares premeds for medical school by offering many resources such as volunteering and internship opportunities, guest speakers, academic help, etc.,” Xu said in an email.  “We also hope members will create lifelong friendships with people who have the same goals and aspirations, and have a supportive network of people when things get tough.”</p>\n<p>According to PhiDE Vice President of Programming and second-year biology major Kevin Le, the new chapter will require 25 students to join to form the founding class, and there are tentative plans to hold the first rush in the fall quarter of 2015.</p>\n<p>“Students looking to join this fraternity should be ready for a challenge, but a worthwhile challenge,” Le said in an email.  “Joining a new fraternity on campus and building it up from the ground is definitely something that is not easy. However, the potential growth and lifetime bonds you could develop from doing so is what makes it worth it and so exciting.”</p>\n<p>Carl Provenzano, Inter-Fraternity Council president and fourth-year biopsychology major, said PhiDE will offer pre-med students a great way for students to get involved.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great to bring out groups that tend to different demographics,” Provenzano said. “And it’s coed and it targets the medical students. It is definitely official and it’s great that students can find a niche and get involved.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the January, Thursday 22, 2015 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60014\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60014\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/","id":2923,"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu"},"related":[2922,2921,2920],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Discusses 24-Hour Café, Mental Health Program","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"\r\nThe Associated Students Senate met last night in the Flying A Room where senators discussed various new developments and university projects.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_60013\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60013\" data-attachment-id=\"60013\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/senate-discusses-24-hour-cafe-mental-health-program/senate-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Senate_Alex-Nagase-11.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Alex Nagase\\/Daily Nexus\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421865874\",\"copyright\":\"2012\",\"focal_length\":\"17\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"Senate\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Senate_Alex-Nagase-11.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Senate_Alex-Nagase-11.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60013\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Senate_Alex-Nagase-11-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"A.S.

Senate members talked over developing a new mental health program and continuing a 24-hour café, while President Ali Guthy clarified her proposal for a new A.S. Main Office entrance at last night’s meeting. <em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met last night in the Flying A Room where senators discussed various new developments and university projects.</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year sociology and psychology major Ali Guthy discussed matters related to future programming at A.S. Program Board, a 24-hour café pilot program and plans to build a new entrance for the A.S. Main Office within the MultiCultural Center (MCC).</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, A.S. Program Board is making progress in creating long-term, alternative programming during Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“A.S. Program Board is working on doing some event planning for Deltopia, and kind of moving on to some sort of long term solution for programming during major Halloween, Deltopia and major events in the future,” Guthy said. “So more information on that will be coming relatively soon.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also tried to correct misconceptions about her proposal to build a new entrance for the A.S. Main Office.</p>\n<p>“The new entrance proposal. I know that an article came out in the <em>Nexus</em>. There were some inaccuracies in the understanding of where this would be,” Guthy said. “No student fees have been spent, no formal proposals have been made, but we’re looking into demolishing one of the A.S. President offices on the left side of the ticket office on the opposite end of the MCC.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also revealed an upcoming pilot program to test whether or not student demand exists for an on campus 24-hour café and announced a pilot program for the idea to occur at the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>“We tried to reach out to the UCen to do more of like a large-scale pilot program but they really want to test the feasibility that students will actually use it enough to cover the cost of the program,” Guthy said. “What we’re planning to do is keep the Study Bean in the library open 24 hours during dead and finals week. That’s gonna be a test to see if that’s a service that students would want.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting A.S. Senator and fifth-year communication major Jimmy Villarreal said he is developing a mental health program that trains students to recognize distress signals among peers and to offer distressed individuals mental health help.</p>\n<p>“The idea of mental health first aid is that, like, what does normal first aid teach? You don’t know how to perform surgery on somebody, but if you see a problem you can address it right then, right there,” Villarreal said. “So eventually for this program we want to expand it to have as many students on campus as possible that can recognize [distress] before you’re really in trouble [and say], ‘Hey you doing okay?’”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Senator Matthew Santos, the purchase of a school supplies vending machine, which the Senate had previously passed a bill on, is currently in progress.</p>\n<p>“The issue that we’re working on for next week is starting a conversation with a specific company to purchase a vending machine,” Santos said. “The next step is identifying sources of funding… And we also wrote a list of the supplies that are a priority in including in this vending, things like blue books, green books, number two pencils.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the January, Thursday 22, 2015 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The panels are funded by students through a <a href=\"http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/Sustainability/RenewableEnergyInitiative.aspx\">$6.00 fee initiative passed in Fall 2010</a>, and make the SRB the second-largest building on campus to run solely on renewable energy, alongside the Recreation Center.</p>\n<p>Alumnus Michael Hewitt, who helped lead the campaign that raised $3.4 million for renewable energy sources on campus in 2009, spoke at the event and said the initiative could not have been passed without the support of students.</p>\n<p>“It addresses economic, environmental and social problems,” Hewitt said. “It ensures that we are a campus that focuses on paving the way for other campuses in terms of taking lead when the students want to see it happen. We put it to the students and they voted to support it and we are so thankful for that. We couldn’t have done it without the students both our year and every year since.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60038\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60038\" data-attachment-id=\"60038\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/uc-system-progresses-toward-carbon-neutrality/alex-nagasedaily-nexus-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lot22-SolarPanel_Alex-Nagase-5.jpg?fit=4928%2C3264&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4928,3264\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Alex Nagase\\/Daily Nexus\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421941946\",\"copyright\":\"2012\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"Alex Nagase\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lot 22 Solar Panel\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lot22-SolarPanel_Alex-Nagase-5.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lot22-SolarPanel_Alex-Nagase-5.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60038\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lot22-SolarPanel_Alex-Nagase-5-1024x678.jpg?resize=300%2C199\" alt=\"Left to right: Clayton Carlson and Michael Hewitt, alumni who were involved in the Green Campus Program.

The division starts to save money,” Hewitt said. “I think every dollar that gets saved here goes directly back into student services.”</p>\n<p>Carlson said he believes the project became a reality because it is a practical investment that serves a good purpose.</p>\n<p>“This is very real, the energy that you save from a project like this,” Carlson said. “It is a worthwhile investment, and it’s the right thing to do. I think that is honestly why it passed.”</p>\n<p>Physics professor and author of <em>Let It Shine: The 6000-Year Story of Solar Energy</em> John Perlin said he hopes to see more university rooftops utilizing solar panels.</p>\n<p>“There are all these rooftops that are potential sun catchers. Our whole vision is to see every rooftop like this. It’s Santa Barbara, it doesn’t make sense not to,” Perlin said. “When you have so much sun coming down, it’s like having a oil pipe that’s leaking.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60064\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/reception-observes-completion-of-solar-array/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60064\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/reception-observes-completion-of-solar-array/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/reception-observes-completion-of-solar-array/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/reception-observes-completion-of-solar-array/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-23/reception-observes-completion-of-solar-array/","id":2925,"author":{"id":163,"name":"Shelly Lu"},"related":[2924,2923,2922],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
