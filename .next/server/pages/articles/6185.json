First of all, he claimed that the majority of Americans are pro-Israel. He appears to have arrived at this conclusion after witnessing the cold reception that Obama received after reiterating his stance on the conflict at the American Israeli Political Affairs Committee’s annual Policy Conference, and the subsequent standing ovations that greeted Netanyahu’s remarks. I really do not think that the people who would attend an AIPAC event are the best population to survey if you want to find out what the people of the United States think.</p>\n<p>This brings me to my next point, which is the problem of AIPAC itself. This organization is a perfect example of how corrupt American “democracy” has become. Just as oil companies are able to spend millions of dollars each year to secure their substantial subsidies and to attack organizations like the EPA, so too does the Israel lobby buy off our members of congress with generous contributions that get them elected. If you think your representatives defend your interests, you are mistaken. They want to keep their jobs, and a pretty damn good way to do that is to kiss the ass of whatever lobbying organization will support your campaign, including AIPAC. Now, do not call me an anti-Semite quite yet. My problem is with the lobbying structure of Washington, not with AIPAC.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Speaking of anti-Semitism, the fact that just about any individual who questions the “rights” of Israel or sympathizes with the Palestinian cause is considered to be an anti-Semite right up there with Erwin Rommel is part of what is wrong with Begakis’ dialogue and with the conservative approach to U.S.-Israeli relations. Just because I identify with the six million Palestinian refugees who live in the occupied territories or throughout the Diaspora does not mean that I hate Jews. Frankly, that assumption offends me in a profound way.</p>\n<p>Moving to the so-called “right” of Israel to exist, I would like to point out that this notion is a falsehood. Prepare for a history lesson. Theodore Herzl, largely accredited to be the founder of the Zionist movement, did not once refer to the “right” of a Jewish state to exist in Israel or anywhere else. There is no mention of this in his text The State of the Jews, nor in Old-New Land. Neither does the original Zionist conference of 1897, the Basel Program, nor the Balfour Declaration of 1917, nor the Mandate for Palestine of 1922 nor even the U.N. Partition Plan of 1947 cite the explicit right of a Jewish state to exist. Not once.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, what other state on this Earth has a right to exist? Do not the people who constitute democratic governments ultimately grant those governments legitimacy? States have no rights. People do. The only text that promises the Jewish people the land of Palestine is the Bible, and if that is now a legitimate political text then please excuse me while I slam my head against the nearest wall.</p>\n<p>Steven, please do not take this the wrong way. I am anti-Zionist, not anti-Semitic, and I am as much anti-Israel as I am anti-Palestine. While I was writing an article for this paper last week, I had a conversation with a member of Students for Justice in Palestine. His name is Nadim Houssain. He said some things that gave me a new perspective on this conflict; a conflict in which I have no personal stake other than the fact that I am a human being and wherever there are human beings suffering — as there are in Palestine — I suffer as well. He told me that he believes in a one-state solution. One secular state to govern the people of Palestine, be they Jewish, Muslim or Christian. One democratic government in which all peoples are represented and the rights of all are upheld.</p>\n<p>While I do not believe that Israelis have a right to a Jewish state, they have a right to live where they want to and to be near their holy land. The Palestinians have that same right, though. And let us not forget that it is they who were colonized in the first place.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-40339\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/people-governments-grant-states-legitimacy-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-40339\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/people-governments-grant-states-legitimacy-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/people-governments-grant-states-legitimacy-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/people-governments-grant-states-legitimacy-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-27/people-governments-grant-states-legitimacy-2/","id":6185,"author":{"id":219,"name":"Michael Dean"},"related":[6184,6183,6182],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":219,"name":"Michael Dean","biography":"Not available","articles":[3146,5926,5953,6185],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Rigid Two-Partied Government Wastes Time, Energy","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Can you think of two separate words that perfectly divide and encapsulate the beliefs, preferences and characteristics of 300 million different people?

No? Well then, how lucky are we that our country’s government has been able to base its entire decision-making process on that very concept. There may have been a time when it really meant something to be a Democrat or Republican (say, when the parties were first founded so that like-minded people could band together in order to give their collective interests a larger voice), but when your group’s membership begins to number in the tens of millions, acting like everyone’s desires are exactly the same becomes something of a charade.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the convenience of only having to choose between one side or the other makes the two-party system a monster of an adversary, as Ralph Nader of the Green Party will tell you. Given that elections of presidents and congressmen are specifically designed for a Republican vs. Democrat contest, it’s difficult for someone who embraces independent, unassociated ideas to compete in the “Us vs. Them” vortex. When you have a system with only two choices, and you’re one of those two choices, there’s not much else to do but try to beat the other side so that your choice is selected. What this means in reality is that Republicans and Democrats spend the majority of their time battling each other for power in order to prove once and for all to the American people that their party is superior and better qualified to run the country.</p>\n<p>So what we get out of this system is a back and forth political free-for-all, with one party briefly gaining an advantage over the other in terms of political power, and then eventually surrendering that power to the other party after being blamed for the world not being perfect while they were calling the shots. On and on it will go, with constructive government actions few and far between, so long as the dominant political matter is determining who is right, instead of what is right.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Okay, that was really depressing to talk about, but finally we can move out of that desert and into the meadows of inspiration. Here’s the proposal: Abolish political parties and the mob mentality they foster. With no party umbrella to hide behind, political candidates will have to run on one thing: their genuine ideas and abilities. If you’re running for some sort of political position, and you majored in architecture and have been employed in that field for your entire life, then put that down next to your name on the ballot. At least then voters would know that you have a verifiable skill.</p>\n<p>If you’re watching TV and see a congressman with the title “John Williams – Democrat,” that really tells you nothing about his abilities as a problem solver or decision maker. Just imagine Congress without parties: Politicians could cast a vote purely based on their own opinion, without having to worry about remaining loyal to their party. That’s right everyone: a party-free America!</p>\n<p>At this point you may be wondering, “If political candidates list their occupational trade instead of a political party, how are voters to know where they stand on political issues?” Simple — develop a questionnaire that is specific to the particular election at hand, and make every candidate for the position fill it out.</p>\n<p>Okay, almost done. Just one more concern to raise and completely dismantle: “If candidates aren’t members of a party, where will they go to raise funds to run a political campaign?” Again, there’s an obvious solution here: eliminate political campaigns. In the age of the internet, it’s unclear why candidates need several months to convey to the public what their political positions are (maybe it’s because they spend most of that time slandering their opponent instead of sharing any interesting ideas for society).</p>\n<p>On the other side of the coin, it’s very hard to say anything meaningful in a 30-second campaign ad on TV. Let’s just get rid of the campaign carnival. A country which requires prospective public officials to raise millions of dollars for the sole purpose of trying to acquire a seat in the U.S. Senate is not one that can truly call itself a democracy. Good day everyone. I’ll see you at the library — I think they may offer more than two book titles there.</p>\n<p><em>Connor Hastings is a graduate student in environmental studies and management.</em></p><div

Every time I see an emotionally-charged movie with my friends, I gloat about not shedding a single tear, even at the most heart-wrenching, gut-turning scenes. But I’m not ashamed to say I cried while watching “A Star Is Born.”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps it’s a testament to the film’s ability to hit every nerve and proof that it was made with every kind of modern-day music lover in mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bradley Cooper, who also directed and produced the film, plays disenchanted country singer Jackson Maine in earnest, performing all of the songs and even earning a few writing credits on the soundtrack. His story with Ally, played by Lady Gaga, is one of the classic boy-meets-girl variety. In fact, this is the third incarnation of the “Star is Born” screenplay. Lately, it does feel like Hollywood is taking advantage of the remake and reboot format – but in Cooper’s hands, this old story feels fresh again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Maine character is a believable portrayal of an old-soul artist with deep-rooted demons. Sometimes the music helps his issues with drugs and alcohol, but more often than not, his dependency is exacerbated by his obligations to withstand long periods of time on the road for tours and an almost constant disconnection from normalcy. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a surprise: Cooper can sing. Very well. The country-tinged rock songs that his character became famous for sound like they were written for the stage, not the silver screen – which is a good thing. Cooper and co. enlisted the talents of Lukas Nelson, son of Willie Nelson, and alt-country auteur Jason Isbell to assist with the movie’s sound. Maine’s world-weary lyrics paired with his slightly weathered voice are a stunning creation by Cooper and makes for a dynamic fictional artist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lady Gaga plays opposite Cooper and shines just as bright as the veteran actor in her first movie role. Of course, her portrayal of Ally mirrors some of the aspects of her real-life rise to fame. After singing in New York clubs for a number of years, she was discovered multiple times, but ran into more than a few roadblocks during her search for stardom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She was criticized for her appearance, her sound and her songwriting – all things that Ally confronts during her own story arc. After Maine discovers Ally singing an enchanting rendition of “La Vie en Rose” in a drag bar, they soon find themselves swept into a whirlwind of success on each other’s behalf. Ally is skeptical of Maine’s insistence that she’ll make it. You can see a young Gaga in this character, loathing her mousy brown hair and prominent nose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is undeniable on screen and in the melding of their voices in song. Although the “Poker Face” singer is famous for her high-energy dance tracks, she was classically trained in her teenage years. Her voice is strong and instantly recognizable, but never overpowering. Although she begins her career by singing ballads with Maine, Ally eventually finds her way to pop. At one point, Maine tells Ally to ‘dig down into’ her soul for the music and never lose sight of who she is. But there’s an inherent negativity toward her newfound stardom and her sound that caters toward popular music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite its glossy sheen and overt theatrics, pop music can still come from a place of authenticity. Lady Gaga the pop star is a wonderful example of this. Of course, she’s famous for the antics of her early career, like wearing dresses made of meat. But you never got the feeling that it wasn’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, craziness and all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an electric chemistry between Cooper and Gaga that makes them believable as artists and a couple. The film never felt cheesy or forced because of this match, which is what makes “A Star is Born” so damn impressive. Of course, we’re rooting for Maine and Ally, but we’re able to get angry with them when they create chaos for themselves, or when they make the wrong decisions when it comes to each other. It’s easier to love characters that are imperfect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I cried for the sadness that Maine feels. I cried for Ally, a young woman who is forced to choose time and time again between love and her career. We know these stories by heart now, the real versions. But it takes a screen to magnify them, to show us what artists have to sacrifice to give us the art. We consume it, and we only think about their struggles when they’re laid out in front of us. But they’re in song, so clearly. Jackson and Ally – the singers, the lovers, the characters, the people – show us this.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

Would it be possible for someone close to him, his mother for example, to have been more alert and vigilant? Could she have taken away the guns and prevented this massacre from happening? With a mother’s instinct, I think the answer is possibly yes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With information research, I learned that the killer had a long-term history of mental illness and socialization difficulty. In the last years of his life, he lived alone in an apartment in Isla Vista. He had no friends, but as a hobby, he collected multiple semi-automatic guns and hundreds of rounds of bullets. In the manifesto he sent out just minutes before he carried out the shooting spree, he described himself as an extremely devastated young man who longed to kill and to die. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Mr. Rodger was a predator, I have deep sympathy for this severely mentally ill young man.

They take years to come up with new policies, and that may not be quick enough to prevent the next shooting spree. On the other hand, parents and family members can be the first resource to keep the guns away from the wrong hands.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can do it TODAY and do it NOW. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parents and family members can also take action more effectively than the legal systems because they know their loved ones better than anyone else. For example, a young man may hide his mental illness, his hatred and his extreme dangerousness from the outsiders, but if aware mothers act on their maternal instincts, some troubled individuals would receive help much sooner and the potential tragedies would be prevented. No mother wants her child to be harmed or killed, even if the individual might be a predator.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a victim’s mother, I wish to raise the awareness of gun safety to keep guns away from the wrong hands.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wrong hands include but are not limited to a mentally impaired person, a very young child, an individual with extreme hatred or an emotionally disturbed and suicidal person. With the help of parents’ and family members’ vigilance, some tragedies might be prevented. If the awareness can save one life, we save his or her mother’s whole world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I plead with you most sincerely to spread this message of awareness. Hopefully it can reach those who are most in need of hearing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I pray that no child will be the next victim of a mass shooting and no mother has to go through the heart-wrenching grief that I have been suffering. May God bless every mother and every mother’s child!</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have ideas or comments, please leave me a message on “George Chen R.I.P.” facebook page, </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ripgeorgechen\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facebook.com/ripgeorgechen</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71243\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/a-victims-mothers-open-plea/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71243\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/a-victims-mothers-open-plea/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/a-victims-mothers-open-plea/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/a-victims-mothers-open-plea/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/a-victims-mothers-open-plea/","id":6184,"author":{"id":404,"name":"Kelly Wang"},"related":[6183,6182,6181],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
