The incident sparked onlookers to begin throwing rocks and bottles at deputies who came to provide reinforcement and ultimately degenerated into a full scale riot between revelers and police, ending with police shutting down DP and firing on crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year financial math and statistics and French double major Sophie Talbot said she had just woken up from a nap when the Deltopia riots broke out and stayed inside her house on the 6500 block of DP while she watched the violence unfold.</p>\n<p>“[Edwards] should be treated as a criminal that assaulted a police officer and also as someone who ruined a community as a whole,” Talbot said in an email. “Not only did people get hurt, but it also completely screwed up a place we call home.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Community Affairs Board Public Relations Co-Chair and second-year art major Roberto Pérez said Edwards acted ignorantly when he assaulted Magaña.</p>\n<p>“[With] scarring an officer over something as stupid as getting away with his alcohol, he better expect repercussions for his actions,” Pérez said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were lots of people, mostly strangers who don’t understand the culture of I.V., and anything can happen when there’s alcohol and large crowds. – Associated Students Community Affairs Board Public Relations Co-Chair Roberto Pérez</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Talbot, law enforcement had difficulty controlling the riots because no one could have foreseen the violence that occurred that night.</p>\n<p>“The police and I.V. could have been as prepared as they could have been,” Talbot said in an email. “Never would they have expected someone smashing a bottle on a police officer’s head.”</p>\n<p>Pérez said it is difficult to determine if the riots could have been prevented if Edwards had not assaulted Magaña because of the ambiguity that occurs with large crowds and alcohol.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s hard to say,” Pérez said in an email. “There were lots of people, mostly strangers who don’t understand the culture of I.V., and anything can happen when there’s alcohol and large crowds.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said he hopes the events that unfolded in April are not repeated in the future.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like to see students be punished, but at the same time I don’t like to see officers be assaulted,” Schunk said. “What I really hope for is in the future we don’t see events like this occurring as often.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he thinks Isla Vista’s adaptive nature will help prevent Deltopia from being as violent as it was last spring.</p>\n<p>“I don’t foresee anything like this occurring again,” Schunk said. “I think that this year there is a collective feeling that we have to kind of change the culture of Deltopia and make it something that won’t bubble over to what it has become.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

visitors, who flock to Isla Vista by the thousands annually for Deltopia (above), from parking in local communities. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The Goleta City Council decided to consider a plan on Tuesday to use parking permits to discourage out-of-town visitors from flooding Isla Vista during Deltopia this April, a method used in October to limit crowds during Halloween.</p>\n<p>Under the plan, parking permits for certain areas of the City of Goleta will be issued by mail and posted in the windows of residents’ cars during the weekend of Deltopia, taking place this year on April 4. The annual event typically attracts thousands of out-of-town visitors, whose presence creates parking issues for portions of the city over the weekend. The parking permits would be issued for neighborhoods south of Hollister Avenue between Cannon Green Drive and Storke Road to the city limits, the same area issued parking permits for Halloween.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Rob Plastino, Goleta City Council saw the damage and destruction caused by Deltopia last spring and is aiming to put preventative measures in place to keep I.V. safe.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day it doesn’t matter how inconvenienced we or the residents of Isla Vista are, it all boils down to if everyone got home safe,” Plastino said. “That’s my number one concern is that you guys are safe.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said one of Goleta’s concern about Deltopia is the number of attendees expected to show up and how the city will protect its residents from the influx.</p>\n<p>“As a city, they are definitely concerned with an influx of outsiders flooding the city streets and potentially parking in front of people’s houses and now the people that live in those houses don’t have parking spaces,” Plastino said. “They’re looking at it as a city that needs to protect its residents, and it’s a good idea for them to do that because it would help us keep the outsiders to a minimum during Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said the parking permits would help deter outsiders from the event if available parking is minimal, and a decrease in visitors could mean less injuries and damage to I.V. and its residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s a concern of mine because my job is to make sure the public of Isla Vista is safe, and that means anyone in Isla Vista, whether that is outsiders or locals,” Plastino said. “I have to make sure that the property of residents remains as safe as possible too.”</p>\n<p>According to Goleta City Council Public Information Officer Valerie Kushnerov, an issue with permitting over Halloween was lack of adequate permits available per resident. Kushnerov said permits would be mailed out to an entire apartment complex rather than each unit, which left multiple residents without protection offered by the permits.</p>\n<p>Kushnerov said the city had undertaken preliminary research and action to ensure more residents receive permits in the event of restrictions.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already researched the area and updated our lists, so that the lists we give to the mail house will be more accurate next time,” Kushnerov said. “There will be additional costs because there’s more postage required to send out more permits, but those costs are minimal.”</p>\n<p>Kushnerov said although the rain could have been a major factor in Halloween’s low attendance, the council believes the permits could be very beneficial, especially with the citizens approval during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“Last year was an interesting year in terms of Halloween because of the rain, so we don’t have a great picture of what impact the parking permits played,” Kushnerov said. “What we do know is that our residents were very happy that the city put in place a program to help minimize impacts to their neighborhoods during Halloween and have asked the city council to continue the program for future events.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College fourth-year psychology major and I.V. resident Austin Thomas said parking is a major problem in I.V. even when there is no event on the weekend.</p>\n<p>“The streets near my house are always crowded, so at times it can be hard for me to find parking by my own house,” Thomas said. “It can get really frustrating because those people might not even be residents, but out-of-towners here for the weekend.”</p>\n<p>Thomas said he thought the use of parking permits would ensure that residents have guaranteed parking during Deltopia and will allow them to enjoy the festivities without worry.</p>\n<p>“I would feel better for the safety of my car and my house if I knew it was just residents parking in our neighborhoods,” Thomas said. “It would be a lot easier to enjoy Deltopia with that peace of mind.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Clinic building is to host free space to provide services to varying local groups.</p>\n<p>“In my dreams, that’s sort of a revolving office space for all the variety of social services that are so difficult for I.V. families to get to because it takes three different buses to get there,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Miller also said a room could be used as a children’s reading space to increase the area available for public use.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have a library here and we don’t have to make a big huge public library,” Miller said, “but there are some uses that we could do to make this very community friendly.”</p>\n<p>Board member of the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) Pegeen Soutar said leasing the large second-floor space could subsidize the first floor for cheaper use.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59911\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59911\" data-attachment-id=\"59911\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-21/possible-isla-vista-community-center-discussed/iv-self-governance/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase.jpg?fit=4928%2C3264&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4928,3264\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"IV Forum on Self Governance Held in the IV Clinic meething room.\\rAmong the ~30 people in attendance were locals, students, alumni, board members, and current and former AS officers.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421780565\",\"copyright\":\"2012\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"IV Self Governance\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Self Governance\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;IV Forum on Self Governance Held in the IV Clinic meething room.&lt;br /&gt;\nAmong the ~30 people in attendance were locals, students, alumni, board members, and current and former AS officers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-59911\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase-1024x678.jpg?resize=396%2C262\" alt=\"Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus\" width=\"396\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IV-Self-Governance-Das-Williams_Alex-Nagase.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59911\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>“What I would hope is that what happens up here [on the second floor] pays enough money so that this space and that space [the first floor] are at a no cost to very, very low cost for the community,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and community organizer Jonathan Abboud said the struggle to develop a community center in I.V. highlights that there is “no local control over local service.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of concerns people bring up are the same reasons why we should have a greater form of self-governance whether it’s a city or a CSD,” Abboud said. “The community center discussion is a small microcosm of the bigger issue of self-governance.”</p>\n<p>Also addressed at the meeting was the university’s potential expansion and purchase of property in I.V.</p>\n<p>Assistant Vice Chancellor for Alumni Affairs George Thurlow said it is unlikely that the university will purchase I.V. housing because of a Long Range Development Plan that says the university must build housing to accommodate for an increase in student residents.</p>\n<p>“At some point that conversation may begin again if there’s a feeling that by buying housing in Isla Vista the university can improve the conditions here,” Thurow said. “There’s no incentive at all.

The victim sustained knife injuries to the chest and head and was taken to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital for treatment, where he is currently stable. Following the incident, Ruiz was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, a felony subject to up to four years in state prison and a maximum $10,000 fine, and bail has been set at $30,000.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega president and third-year psychology and economics major Jason Ouyang said Ruiz was heavily intoxicated and was accompanied by a “female accomplice,” both of whom approached the fraternity and demanded entry to a private gathering at the house.</p>\n<p>“We were having a small get-together, ourselves and our friends, and this person was not allowed entry into our house,” Ouyang said. “The guy was very aggressive and probably under the influence of alcohol … my brothers wouldn’t let him come in and he took that very personally and he tried to start a fight … he pulled out some sort of weapon and gave him a couple lacerations.”</p>\n<p>Sheriff’s Office officials denied requests for additional information on the incident.</p>\n<p>Ouyang said the incident was unprecedented and the fraternity never has issues keeping people from coming into private gatherings.</p>\n<p>“In this situation I guess that person wasn’t gonna take no for an answer,” Ouyang said. “Usually there’s never problems like this; this is the very first time something to this has occurred — its a little traumatizing.”</p>\n<p>According to Ouyang, the fraternity would gather in the next few days to assess the situation and focus on the group.</p>\n<p>“We’re all just kinda shaken by it but at the same time we can’t let that deter us,” Ouyang said.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega is a multicultural social fraternity and part of the Multicultural Greek Council on campus.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office is requesting that anyone with information contact Isla Vista Foot Patrol investigators at (805) 683-2724, or in person at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office, located at 6504 Trigo Road.
