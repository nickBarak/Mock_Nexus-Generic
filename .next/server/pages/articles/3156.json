The council also voted down a resolution condemning a racially themed party organized by a UC Irvine fraternity last November.</p>\n<p>Finance Board chair Katie Lieberknecht said the board slashed next year’s budget from $672,496 to $400,695 in order to accommodate three new advisors and one part-time position.</p>\n<p>According to Lieberknecht, if every Boards, Committees and Commissions’ budget was fully allocated next year, finance board would be left with a $300,000 deficit in its unallocated fund.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that A.S. does not have money — because it does — but we need to account for the growth of positions because we are still receiving the same amount of money,” Lieberknecht said.</p>\n<p>Lieberknecht said the budget should signify the association’s priorities.</p>\n<p>“Cuts are inevitable at every level of the budget process,” Lieberknecht said. “We had to make cuts, the president is going to have to make cuts and [Leg Council] is going to have to make cuts.”</p>\n<p>The budget is currently under review by A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez and will be made public within the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lieberknecht said BCCs have been breaking the A.S. Constitution by funding Office of Student Life groups’ travel expenses and over $500 for food without administering one-time exceptions.</p>\n<p>“When BCCs are funding OSL groups there is a lot of policy-breaking and it’s usually not caught until it gets to admin and it’s already passed through minutes and Leg Council,” Lieberknecht said.</p>\n<p>Alfredo Del Cid, university-owned housing representative, suggested developing a uniform process for requesting finances.</p>\n<p>“I think it would help if there was a streamlined process for funding,” Del Cid said. “I’ve been to multiple committee meetings and some have you give a form to the treasurer and some just bring it up in meetings.”</p>\n<p>The council decided not to condemn the actions of Irvine’s Phi Kappa Psi that held a Pilgrims and Indians -themed party last year.</p>\n<p>Del Cid, who authored the resolution, said the UCI administration still hasn’t taken action against the frat.</p>\n<p>“This is not an attack on the fraternity, but on the action,” Del Cid said. “We’re not telling them what to do, but that we stand in solidarity.”</p>\n<p>However, Yeni Nguyen, off-campus representative, said the council has no reason to target this specific party.</p>\n<p>After the resolution failed, Off-Campus Representative Amanda Berry said future resolutions should address all parties of this nature.</p>\n<p>“If we’re going to take a stand on this, then take a stand and make it general that ‘We don’t support any parties that do this’ instead of ‘We don’t support this particular party that had this specific theme,’” Berry said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The 4,270 square-foot space, which may open as early as next month, will also include community resources for UCSB students including a computer lab as well as rooms for studying, recreation and tutoring.</p>\n<p>Cori Lantz, A.S. external vice president of local affairs and a fourth-year political science major, said the new office will provide the student body amenities that can currently  only be found on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to do more outreach to students and families in Isla Vista,” Lantz said. “This is a really amazing resource that [I.V.] needs.”</p>\n<p>Megan Shumate, Isla Vista Community Relations Committee chair, said the annex will also provide a meeting space for A.S. entities that currently don’t have a residence.<br>\n“Our committee deals just with Isla Vista and its relations on and off campus so we’re really excited to finally have a home in Isla Vista,” Shumate said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Community Affairs Board Chair Amanda Galvin said the Family Literacy Program will greatly benefit from the space. Galvin also said the tutoring service will now be accessible to more I.V. families as its new location will be an ideal middle-ground between families and student tutors.</p>\n<p>“This program is helping elementary students through tutoring given by UCSB students,” Galvin said. “We’re moving all our offices for it out to the new space.”<br>\nLantz said the money devoted to the project will circulate back to the community.</p>\n<p>“The money that’s paid towards rent will go back into a public agency so the money has been committed to the development of Isla Vista,” Lantz said. “It could go towards lighting or repaving of streets so the aesthetics of Isla Vista will be improved.”</p>\n<p>IVCRC and C.A.B. each distributed $24,000 for the new space, while A.S. Legislative Council dispensed $3,000 and the Student Commission On Racial Equality distributed another $1,273. Nearly $33,000 of annual funding is needed to move ahead with the project, and the external vice president of local affairs office and 12 other A.S. BCCs are seeking additional funding from Finance Board for that amount.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/annex-provide-resources-iv-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/annex-provide-resources-iv-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/annex-provide-resources-iv-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/annex-provide-resources-iv-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/annex-provide-resources-iv-community/","id":3154,"author":{"id":182,"name":"Marissa Wenzke"},"related":[3153,3152,3151],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fraud Claims Arise in A.S.","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"An annual external audit of UCSB’s Associated Students revealed potential embezzlement within the organization during the 2009-2010 fiscal year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>An annual external audit of UCSB’s Associated Students revealed potential embezzlement within the organization during the 2009-2010 fiscal year.</p>\n<p>The written report given to A.S. Legislative Council members on Tuesday indicated a possible misappropriation of an undisclosed amount of A.S. funds by an employee within the organization. However, the auditors’ presentation at the Legislative Council meeting last night failed to include any verbal mention of fraud.</p>\n<p>The review of A.S. financial statements from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 by public accounting firm Nasif, Hicks, Harris &amp; Co., LLP showed extensive growth within the organization since 2009. Net assets increased $373,634 since 2009 to $4,284,517 in 2010, with total assets listed at $4,434,049 due to $149,532 in total current liabilities.</p>\n<p>Total revenues and gains increased more than $70,000 from $10,958,473 in 2009 to $11,032,165 in 2010 while total expenses and losses increased nearly $515,000 from $10,143,921 in 2009 to $10,658,531 in 2010. The increased expenses were composed primarily of a $208,684 boost in staff salaries and an additional $223,870 in university support.</p>\n<p>The majority of A.S. revenue is generated through lock-in fees and sales of services and products such as the A.S. Bike Shop and other programs. In 2006, students voted to increase the A.S. lock-in fee referendum by $100 per quarter, effectively tripling student contributions to the organization.</p>\n<p>According to Mark Jackson, who presented on behalf of the auditors, nearly all of A.S. funding comes from this fee. In 2010, 91 percent of A.S.’s revenue came from the student lock-in fee.</p>\n<p>After the audit presentation, council members made numerous amendments to the Elections Committee Modifications Bill that governs campus elections to clarify points within the bill including endorsements and jurisdiction over elections.</p>\n<p>Off-campus representative Joe Lewis said the bill’s language needs clarification so current elected officials can not use their current position to influence voter opinion.</p>\n<p>“I think we should change the wording about endorsements to deliberately using your title to endorse a candidate,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>The council passed an amendment stating no money allocated by A.S. to any special interest, registered groups or appointed officers either fully or partially funded by A.S. can be used in endorsements.</p>\n<p>The council also argued over consequences for breaking endorsement restrictions. As originally written, elected officials lose honoraria if they break endorsement guidelines and executive officers lose spring quarter tuition as well.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-large Chloe Stryker said the bill should specify which entity possesses jurisdiction to rule on violations of elections policy.</p>\n<p>“I think we need to follow the legal code to avoid Judicial Council hearings,” Stryker said. “It’s just too hard to give [elections committee] all power the entire year and not known when Leg Council has power.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus representative Amanda Berry said elections committee had too much control in the decision.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s fair for elections committee, which has so few people, to be able to take away an exec’s entire tuition and their honoraria,” Berry said.</p>\n<p>Elections committee chair Sunjeet Gill said the committee’s recommendations were based on prior experience.</p>\n<p>“It’s not ok for you to be a leader on campus and break the rules and just pay a fee for that,” Gill said. “We want people to be afraid of breaking rules; that’s why we put it into effect. This is like a concrete punishment.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32808\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/fraud-claims-arise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32808\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/fraud-claims-arise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/fraud-claims-arise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/fraud-claims-arise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-03/fraud-claims-arise/","id":3155,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3154,3153,3152],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
