UCSC graduate students have been on strike since early February, and UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dismissed </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at least 54 of them from their Spring Quarter 2020 appointments last Friday, sparking outrage across the UC system.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">began their own full strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Thursday; at UC Davis, graduate students </span><a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2020/02/26/uc-davis-graduate-students-in-support-of-cola-to-withhold-winter-quarter-grades-beginning-feb-27/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">began a grading strike on Feb. 27</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, meaning they are withholding Winter Quarter 2020 grades. They will continue to strike until their demands are met, according to a statement posted to the movement’s Twitter account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA movements on other campuses are planning a one-day, full work stoppage “blackout” strike on Thursday, March 5, in solidarity with the dismissed UCSC graduate students. At each campus, COLA movements are urging faculty to cancel all classes and undergraduate students to walk out of any classes that professors didn’t cancel. Organizers are also asking participants to wear all black. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an ever growing number of students who are ready to strike and who are prepared to strike,” Zak Fisher, UC Los Angeles’ Graduate Student Association president, told the Nexus. Fisher attributed this sentiment not only to the COLA movement at UCLA but also to the firing of the UCSC graduate students, noting that participation in COLA organizing has “increased exponentially.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA graduate students voted Monday evening to join the Thursday “blackout” strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people are just fed up … the [UCSC] firings brought a lot of attention from people who weren’t really paying attention before,” he said, adding that hundreds of people have attended  UCLA COLA rallies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher, as GSA president, said he presented the UCLA COLA demands to UCLA Chancellor Gene Block on Feb. 21. But beyond that, he said he hasn’t seen much of a response from the chancellor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why is it that it’s the ‘number one public university,’ in the country, [and] the leader of the university won’t come out and publicly address concerns?” Fisher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to at Davis, UC San Diego organizers are leaning more toward a grading strike rather than a full strike, according to Syed Muhammad Abbas Yousuf, an ethnic studies doctoral student, and Avaneesh Narla, a physics doctoral student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two said that a recent UCSD COLA movement vote showed that around 200 graduate students were willing to strike in some capacity, although there is a “strong leaning toward holding a grading strike rather than a full strike.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people are just fed up.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Week Nine, UCSD graduate students scheduled a number of events aimed at educating undergraduates about the movement and gaining support across campus for the movement; they will be joining the “blackout” strike by holding a walkout around 1:30 p.m. on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley graduate students also voted to join the one-day “blackout” strike, according to Tara Phillips, a UCB COLA organizer. UCB’s strike will last from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Sproul Plaza in the center of campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCB COLA movement also voted Tuesday to create a departmental organizing structure and will begin asking different departments to hold meetings to discuss and vote on strike-readiness, according to a resolution passed by the movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once we’ve reached 10 strike-ready departments, we will call a General Assembly to vote on strike escalation on our campus,” an email sent to supporters of the UCB COLA movement said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Riverside, graduate students plan to join the UC-wide “blackout” strike with a rally at 11:45 a.m., according to the movement’s Twitter account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has also released a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyviszddmLXQBJLzQkF7FesG53qcQWrZ0BetfINuBtmzk78A/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the UCR community, asking students to stand in solidarity with the UCSC strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While graduates at some campuses are taking steps toward a vote to strike, others, such as UC Irvine, haven’t decided to go on a full strike but are still organizing for a COLA in other ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI COLA organizers Nalya Rodriguez, a sociology doctoral student, and Courtney Echols, a criminology law and society doctoral student, said that UCI COLA organizing began on Feb. 20, when over 200 UCI graduate students and supporters rallied in solidarity with the UCSC strikers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, UCI put the administration building Aldrich Hall on lockdown. During the rally, campus police </span><a href=\"https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/02/29/uci-alumna-arrested-by-ucipd-during-cost-of-living-adjustment-rally-for-uc-santa-cruz-graduate-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested UCI alumni </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shikera Chamndany</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after she entered the building while attempting to obtain her transcripts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chamndany, who was reportedly not involved with the COLA movement or participating in the rally, was “handcuffed and tackled,” the New University reported. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The arrest drew backlash both on campus and across the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We firmly believe that this [is] indicative of the anti-Blackness that pervades not just UC Irvine, but the UC system as a whole,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Echols said. She said that the following day, the university put out a campus-wide statement “trying to illustrate that they cared about UCI graduate students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But we know that if they actually cared, they would immediately send these issues of unfair wages and unjust housing costs which disproportionately affect Black and brown students,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCI COLA movement held a sick-out on Monday and Tuesday, during which graduate students called in sick and did not show up to work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The average Irvine graduate student spends 43% of their income on rent, and some students report spending as much as 90% of their income on rent here in Irvine,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with a COLA, UCI graduate students are d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emanding that the officer who arrested Chamndany, Sgt. Tricia Harding, be fired, and that the campus police be abolished. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93334\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/community-gathers-to-celebrate-life-of-isla-vista-advocate-michael-bean/cola_jonathan-sloboda_online_4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-93334\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93334\" data-attachment-id=\"93334\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/community-gathers-to-celebrate-life-of-isla-vista-advocate-michael-bean/cola_jonathan-sloboda_online_4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"COLA_Jonathan Sloboda_ONLINE_4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93334\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COLA_Jonathan-Sloboda_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93334\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jonathan Sloboda / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Merced UAW 2865 unit chair Anh Diep explained that even though UC Merced is the “cheapest” UC campus in terms of cost of living, students have been supportive of the UCSC graduate student strikers and have begun advocating for administration to address graduate student needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people think that Merced would be the campus that doesn’t care … since it’s so new and it’s built in the Central Valley where real estate is cheapest,” Diep said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But we do feel rent burden here, and we have seen this dramatic increase in the last few years. We’re especially cognizant that the time to act is now, the time to be proactive is now, because we have a chance to stop this in our own city and prevent further rent burden and further rent hikes before it gets as dramatically bad as it has gotten in the other campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diep said that UAW 2865 leadership, along with general members, met with UCM Chancellor Nathan Brostrom on March 2 to </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kWBMnJQHG5tgoC2JGAN3kUUHBlaZHxcm-QVkCCLlKXg/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discuss graduate student struggles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and that they plan to meet sometime next week for a follow-up meeting. Diep emphasized that the discussion focused on broader needs and did not focus on the specific TA contract currently in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been no formal UC-wide response to the COLA movements to date; organizers across the UC system emphasized that negotiations need to happen through UCOP instead of at individual universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents filed an Unfair Practices Charge against UAW 2865 on Feb. 24, alleging that the union has failed to take action to end strikes at UCSC. In response, UAW 2865 filed two separate Unfair Practice Charges against the UC; the UAW 2865 bargaining unit also voted on March 3 to hold a union-wide vote whether to go on strike due to unfair labor practices. All union members will vote on this in April. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students are on a “wildcat” strike, meaning that they are striking without the approval of their union and contract. </span><em>Jonathan Sloboda / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 2865 filed formal charges against the UC with California Public Employment Relations Board (PERB), alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the complaints, UAW 2865 alleged that the UC attempted to bargain for a COLA with individuals and groups instead of the union. It also alleged that the UC went outside of the collective bargaining agreement with UAW by firing teaching assistants for withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every member of the union will soon have the chance to democratically vote on whether or not we can hold a strike. If approved, this action would be statewide, and could affect every department at the University of California,” UAW 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar said in a press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the COLA movement grows across the UC, graduate students have emphasized that their actions are a “wildcat” strike, meaning that they are striking without the approval of their union and contract, which was negotiated by UAW in 2018 and expires in 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-18/janet-napolitano-ucsc-administration-warn-of-termination-to-striking-ucsc-graduate-students/\">wrote</a> on Feb. 14 to UCSC faculty that the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) would not “re-open the agreement or negotiate a separate side-letter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 24, the UC Regents filed an <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\">Unfair Practice Charge</a> against UAW. Since the UC system is a public institution, all labor disputes go through PERB when one party in a state labor contract alleges another of unfair practice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents allege that UAW “condoned, supported, encouraged, and failed to take affirmative action to end, unlawful concerted activity in violation of the parties’ No Strikes clause,” the charges read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Unfair Practice Charge will be decided by PERB in a public hearing if the charges are not settled beforehand. A hearing date has not been set, according to UAW statewide Trustee and doctoral history student Andrew Elrod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents are requesting that PERB issue multiple orders of action against UAW: one declaring the work stoppages at UCSC and all other UC campuses an illegal strike, and another order for UAW to refrain from engaging in any strikes, according to the charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents are also requesting that PERB seek an injunction to prevent Academic Student Employees (ASE) — which includes teaching assistants, tutors and readers — and UAW from engaging in strikes and “any other relief the Board deems just and proper,” the charges read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the two orders both restrict current strikes, if enacted, the injunction would give the UC the authority to forcibly shut down strikes with police at all UC campuses, according to Elrod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the UC Regents’ unfair practice charge, UAW filed two separate Unfair Practice Charges on Feb. 28 and March 2 against the Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\">first set</a> of charges allege that the UC refused to negotiate a COLA with UAW, while at the same time bargaining directly with individuals and university-funded student organizations, which don’t have the legal authority to bargain with the UC, according to a UAW press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear that UC wants to create an appearance that it is respecting graduate student employees while avoiding true bargaining, where the law requires the parties to stand with equal footing and to act in good faith,” the press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no current bargaining between graduate students and UCOP, Napolitano published a statement on Feb. 21 saying that she would meet with the UC Graduate and Professional Council (UCGPC) to discuss a variety of issues including “cost of living.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCGPC then published a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/ucgpc-says-it-will-not-meet-with-napolitano-to-discuss-a-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">statement</a> clarifying that the meeting was not in response to COLA, and that the timing and wording of Napolitano’s statement caused a misunderstanding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charges also referenced the offer UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive extended to striking graduate students, which included guaranteed five-year packages for Ph.D. students and two-year packages for M.A. students, along with a $2,500 annual housing supplement for graduate students who submitted fall quarter grades and stopped striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\">second set</a> of Unfair Practice Charges, filed on March 2, allege that the UC violated the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\">dismissing</a> UCSC TAs from spring quarter appointments for withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades; according to the charges, the UC “denies these workers their statutory right to union representation and is intended to bypass the union.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These charges led to the UAW Bargaining Team’s vote on March 3, paving the way for a full UAW vote of whether or not to hold a labor practice strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have been calling for the University to come to the table and negotiate a Cost of Living Adjustment for months now. And it is not true that UC can’t reopen the contract that was ratified in 2018. It’s that they won’t. We ask them every day to open the contract and negotiate a</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COLA4ALL?src=hashtag_click\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> #COLA4ALL</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

operate the distribution center to help the houseless access government benefits resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Wednesdays and Fridays from 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. in the new Isla Vista Community Center, workers operate the distribution center to help the houseless access government benefits resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (C.A.R.E.S.) Act, which includes $1,200 checks to those earning under $75,000 per year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most immediate need that the program is addressing is the meal distribution, according to Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD).</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s just not as much food around in the community as there is when we’ve got a full town and economy that is operating in a normal way, so hunger is a real issue,” Brandt said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CSD’s distribution program receives 125 food donations from McDonald’s and 75 food donations from Lunchbox, a Santa Barbara restaurant, amounting to 200 meals per day, according to Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, an expanded version of the I.V. CSD’s partnership with Northern Santa Barbara County United Way — the local branch of a community service nonprofit emphasizing houselessness assistance — previously used the small I.V. CSD office space near the community center to streamline houseless residents into the coordinated entry program, which aims to house houseless residents, according to Emily Allen, director of homeless and veterans impact initiatives at Northern Santa Barbara County United Way.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The program expanded to the community center to accommodate social distancing regulations and provide additional services, according to Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What folks can do at the Resource Center is obtain meals, care packages that include face coverings, hand sanitizer. Additionally, they can access our Wi-Fi if they need to check their email,” Brandt said, adding that houseless individuals could also use the Wi-Fi to file to receive a stimulus check.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The care packages contain bottled water, soap, toothpaste and other cleanliness tools, according to Allen.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other local food distribution services, such as the Miramar Food Pantry and the Associated Students Food Bank, are operating under decreased hours, which increases the need for additional food provisions, according to Allen.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the different meal shares that happened in the community stopped operating. And so pretty early on, one of the first things that we started to do was put together prepared meal boxes and just add non-perishable food for people,” Allen said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The nature of houselessness, with precarious living situations and uneven access to necessities, makes it extremely difficult for houseless individuals to follow shelter-in-place orders or social distancing guidelines, according to Jonathan Abboud, the I.V. CSD’s general manager.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud added that the I.V. CSD is still looking for additional partners to help provide services for I.V.’s houseless residents, who he said are “affected the most” by the pandemic, but have the “least resources during this time.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-14/isla-vista-community-services-district-expands-houselessness-support-efforts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-14/isla-vista-community-services-district-expands-houselessness-support-efforts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-14/isla-vista-community-services-district-expands-houselessness-support-efforts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-14/isla-vista-community-services-district-expands-houselessness-support-efforts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-14/isla-vista-community-services-district-expands-houselessness-support-efforts/","id":4058,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[4057,4056,4055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"In Photos | Graduate Students Block Entrances, Occupy Cheadle Hall In Fight For COLA","category":"News","subcategory":"UCSB COLA Movement","publish_date":"2020-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0067.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0067.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At each campus, COLA movements are urging faculty to cancel all classes and undergraduate students to walk out of any classes that professors didn’t cancel.
