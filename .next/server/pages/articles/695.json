Despite missing the one-and-one attempt, she was able to rebound her own miss, giving UCSB possession of the ball with 29 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“[Tilleman is] playing with a whole different sense of urgency,” Head Coch Carlene Mitchell said. “She refused to lose tonight and that’s what we get from her every night — the big plays and the hustle plays.”</p>\n<p>That set the stage for junior guard Nicole Nesbit, who used a screen from senior forward Sweets Underwood to drive down the right side and drain a layup to give the Gauchos a one point lead with just 12.5 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“There was no doubt we wanted Nic to come off a down screen,” Mitchell said. “She gets her shoulder around extremely well, so it was a play call to her and she executed it.”</p>\n<p>Playing defense during the final possession, Underwood was able to knock the ball out of bounds with 0.7 seconds left. 6’2’’ junior center Pua Kailiawa was subbed into the game for Hawaii to take the last-second shot, but missed the jumper to give Santa Barbara back-to-back wins for the first time since mid-December.</p>\n<p>“We were taking high switches on everything,” Mitchell said. “With 0.7 on the clock, we knew it had to be a chip, so we wanted to put pressure on the ball. They got a good look, but I think our kids did a great job for 40 minutes on the defensive end, holding them to 50 points.”</p>\n<p>The win was also the first come-from-behind victory for the Gauchos as the team trailed 25-23 at halftime.</p>\n<p>“We found a way to win, so I’m extremely proud of that,” Mitchell said. “We kept making big plays and getting stops. From top to bottom, it was a great effort.”</p>\n<p>For the second straight game, UCSB found its offensive rhythm, shooting 47.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Zornig led all players with 15 points on 7-10 shooting and four assists. Underwood also tallied 13 points while Nesbit contributed nine. Tilleman also added nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig] did a great job of attacking,” Mitchell said. “Her threes didn’t fall early in the game, [but] she’s working hard on being a complete player. It was her night and her number was called and she made big plays in the second half.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be Thursday when the team hosts UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 28th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49773\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/nesbits-heroics-lift-gauchos-in-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49773\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/nesbits-heroics-lift-gauchos-in-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/nesbits-heroics-lift-gauchos-in-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/nesbits-heroics-lift-gauchos-in-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/nesbits-heroics-lift-gauchos-in-hawaii/","id":695,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[694,693,692],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Hungry for Third Straight Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Tonight against UC Riverside, the UCSB women’s basketball team will have the opportunity to do something they have yet to do all season: win three consecutive games.

UCSB handily defeated Northridge for the 12th consecutive time, using a 20-6 second half run and solid defense to earn a 56-37 victory. Against Hawaii, in a game that went down to the wire, junior guard Nicole Nesbit came up with the winning basket to give the Gauchos a 51-50 victory and hand the Rainbow Wahine their first home conference loss of the year.</p>\n<p>“We never want to get too high or too low,” junior guard Melissa Zornig said. “It was great that we got those two wins, but we still need to take care of business the next couple games and take it game by game.”</p>\n<p>At 5-4, UCSB has proved it can win on the road, but now Santa Barbara will have to prove it can win at home as the Gauchos are only 2-5 at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done a better job on the road of sticking to the key things — our defensive principles and executing offensively,” Underwood said. “We have yet to do that at home.”</p>\n<p>Riverside enters the game in ninth place in conference at 9-9 overall and 2-5 in league and has lost two straight games.</p>\n<p>“You can look at their record and it can be misleading,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “They had a great win against Washington State in the Pac-12 and they beat Long Beach State, who beat us, so I don’t think their record is indicative of the type of team they are or the abilities that they have.”</p>\n<p>Riverside features possibly the best player in the Big West in senior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham, who leads the conference in points with 18.3 and ranks second in steals with 2.9 per game. “She’s a big time player,” Underwood said. “She’s a point guard who does it all. They run everything through and to her and our game plan is to throw a couple different bodies on her.” Although known for their defense, holding teams to a league-leading 54.5 points per game, the Gauchos have put together two straight solid offensive performances. Against Northridge and Hawaii, the team averaged 47.3 percent shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>“We’re still taking fewer shots than our opponents, so to me, that’s key,” Mitchell said. “That probably means we’re taking good shots. We’re not shooting quick shots in transition and it’s more of an attack mentality.”</p>\n<p>Fueling UCSB’s offense has been Underwood, who won this week’s Big West Player of the Week Award after a double-double against Northridge and a 13-point performance in Hawaii. Overall, she ranks third in the Big West in rebounding, grabbing 8.5 boards per contest, and fourth in field goal percentage at 50.9 percent.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 31st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div

lead.</p>\n<p>Those would be the guard’s only points until close to the end of the first half, as the Big West Player of the Week was never really able to find his footing on the offensive end, going 5-for-15 from the field for 18 points.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, both senior Gabe Vincent and graduate transfer Marcus Jackson were more than ready to step into the offensive role that Heidegger usually filled.</p>\n<p>Vincent has seen his production go down this year, which isn’t too surprising coming off a major injury.</p>\n<p>The guard scored 11 points in the first half, and had an answer for each USF make.</p>\n<p>He made a pivotal shot halfway through the first; when the Gauchos had conceded two shots in a row and trailed by five, he knocked in a long jumper to keep it a one-possession game. Down the stretch, both he and Jackson made tough plays that offset some of the problems UCSB had rebounding.</p>\n<p>Jackson finished with 10 points on 3-of-6 shooting from the field and a 2-for-3 performance behind the 3-PT line.</p>\n<p>For the Dons, senior forward Chase Foster played a huge role in ensuring that the game was tied at halftime.</p>\n<p>He scored or assisted on the last eight points of the half and led both teams at halftime with 14 points.</p>\n<p>His outside shooting (2-for-4 in the first half from three) spread the Gauchos’ defense out, which was key in the rebounding advantage that the Dons took into halftime.</p>\n<p>In the second half, the talent of the Gauchos was just too much for the Dons as the game devolved into a slugfest.</p>\n<p>The teams combined for 27 fouls in the period, and with both teams missing a boatload of threes (USF went 6-for-33 and UCSB 6-for-19), it came down to who could make the tough shots.</p>\n<p>The answer to that question was graduate transfer Leland King II, who had yet another double-double in this game with 21 points and 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The forward led all players in scoring in and down the stretch, using his combination of length and skill to get key buckets in a short time.</p>\n<p>With about five minutes to go, he knocked in back-to-back buckets, which moved the UCSB lead up to five.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos never looked back, eventually getting the seven-point victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes back home Saturday night to host the University of San Diego.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest changes that the team is looking to make is not on the court, but rather the culture and atmosphere surrounding the program off of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re trying to build this program to have a dominant home court,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack explained. “We need all the students to come out and support these guys. I think they’ll be excited to see the team that we have, which includes one of the top scorers in the country (Max Heidegger is 10th in the NCAA) and Santa Barbara’s best record since 2010.”</span></p>\n<p>The Toreros are a perfect 5-0 to start off the year, and they come into the matchup led by guard Isaiah Wright, who has done a little bit of everything for San Diego so far.</p>\n<p>The Boise State transfer is averaging 14.2 points, 6 assists and 6 rebounds a game, leading his team in all three categories.</p>\n<p>The task of covering him will probably be up to Jackson and Heidegger, although the great team defense of the Gauchos will make sure that Wright sees a lot of long bodies coming his way throughout the game.</p>\n<p>If UCSB stays composed on offense and communicates well on defense, it could have a good chance of ending yet another win streak.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 30, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

We’re not as physical as we need to be,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Most games we play in, it has not been as big a problem because we have one very physical human being (Alan Williams) down in the low paint area to kind of mop things up.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Junior forward Christian Standhardinger led the Rainbow Warriors with a career-high 31 point, 16 rebound performance. Even more impressive, Standhardinger only had four points at the break, exploding for 27 in the second half.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good player,” Coach Williams said. “He’s what this league doesn’t have a lot of, a 6’8” wing-type player that’s got a body on him. In this league he can play anywhere from the two to the five. He hurts you in a lot of ways.”</p>\n<p>Clearly overmatched down low due to the absence of Williams, UCSB opted to try its luck from long range, attempting 28 three-pointers, compared to 10 for Hawaii. The Gauchos converted nine of those opportunities, but its top two three-point shooters in freshman forward Taran Brown and junior guard Kyle Boswell were a combined 1-15 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Taran didn’t do much for his percentage tonight,” Coach Williams said. “It’s a bad shooting night out of those two. You have to give people some credit, they’re doing some good things on Bos.”</p>\n<p>Brown led UCSB with 15 points and six rebounds, but shot 7-23 on the night including a dismal 1-12 from behind the arc. Boswell was second on the team with 12 points, but was 0-3 on three-pointers. Sophomore guard T.J. Taylor notched 11 points and four assists on the night, while senior guard Nate Garth had eight points and eight assists.</p>\n<p>Out with injury for much of the season, junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle provided UCSB with solid play with eight points, two assists and two steals in 21 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>“The guy that I actually thought had a pretty decent game again was Keegan Hornbuckle in terms of doing what he is capable of doing and having to play more minutes than he is capable of right now,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Fouls plagued UCSB for much of the night as Hawaii shot 39 free throws. Santa Barbara was outrebounded 45-30 on the night and allowed 20 second chance points to the Rainbow Warriors.</p>\n<p>“Not having [Big Al] isn’t really an excuse for not boxing someone out,” Boswell said. “We just let them climb our backs and get second chance points all night long. You literally can’t beat a team that’s that big and not box them out.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii snapped a two-game losing streak with the victory and won its first Big West road victory since moving to the conference this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces Long Beach State on the road on Wednesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 28th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49767\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/ucsb-falls-in-televised-game-to-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49767\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/ucsb-falls-in-televised-game-to-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/ucsb-falls-in-televised-game-to-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/ucsb-falls-in-televised-game-to-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/ucsb-falls-in-televised-game-to-hawaii/","id":694,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[693,692,691],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
