Judges examined the separate projects and decided winners based on work ethic and teamwork, not necessarily on the quality of the final product. Major companies represented at the event included Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, Citrix and others.</p>\n<p>SB Hacks also held a series of educational tech talks this past Saturday, the second day of the three-day Hackathon weekend, to introduce participants to new topics in computer science and to assist hackers with project challenges that had arisen over the course of the competition.</p>\n<p>The talks covered a wide range of topics including discussion on game design and workshops for platforms such as Cydia, eSports and Angular, and for teaching Swift, an iOS programming language used to design applications. During the workshops, programmers of all levels also had an opportunity to write online versions of the best-selling mobile game Flappy Bird.</p>\n<p>The event also featured special amenities for participants including free meals, Nerf gun competitions, meditation sessions and formal video game tournaments for console games such as Super Smash Bros and Halo.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60364\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60364\" data-attachment-id=\"60364\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-4.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Several video game tournaments were held in a tent just outside the Corwin Pavilion.

He also introduced his program Cydia, an alternative to the Apple app store, and focused on its ability to customize devices with specific features not available in Apple’s app store.</p>\n<p>“Not everything is an app that could go in the app store in the first place … Cydia instead is about extensions and modifications,” Freeman said, “Cydia is a place where you can get custom looks for your phone, you can go and get new features … you can also make modifications inside of apps.”</p>\n<p>Third-year computer science major Andrew Dutcher said his team created a smartphone app allowing music from different playlists or tracks to start playing once you enter a designated geographical area.</p>\n<p>“You have a map on an Android phone, you make a circle, step into the circle in the real, physical world and music will play from one playlist,” Dutcher said. “Step out of the circle and music will play from another playlist. Step back in, it will play from the first playlist again.”</p>\n<p>According to Dutcher, the application his team created was inspired by video game programming.</p>\n<p>“The impetus for this problem is a 3D programmer in videogames. If you go from area A to area B, there will be a pop up and the music changes,” Dutcher said. “So you have theme music for areas. This is obviously useful to have music for different areas or for self-guided tours. Augmenting reality with geographical based theme music is really satisfying!”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60368\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60368\" data-attachment-id=\"60368\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-8.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"Hacksrs presenting their hacks at the first rouhd of the exposition.

If we had more time, we’d be able to graph it and you’d see some oscillations that would reflect the rate of oxygen consumption in your blood.”</p>\n<p>West College electrical engineering major Robin Morales, one of Anderson’s teammates, and said he hopes the device can be made smaller, more portable and more practical for everyday use.</p>\n<p>“We did this so you can take it with you,” Morales said. “You don’t need to be in a hospital room or have a huge clunky device at home. … It interfaces with a computer; you can enjoy your hike and see how you did instead of constantly checking. …The components will get smaller and cheaper and then can get integrated with smart phones or even fitness watches.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the team’s project transcended winning a prize and that their creation and development of the app was what team members were most proud of.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t finished the software yet, so you know, we might win something,” Anderson said. “But we didn’t come here to win, we came here to learn something.”</p>\n<p>UCLA computer science major Dee Chen said his team created a portable paper piano that allows users a more affordable and accessible alternative to learning and playing the piano.</p>\n<p>“It’s sensing capacitants. Your body acts as a natural capacitant. So when you touch it, it sends a signal and we can measure that signal and then can play a sound off of that. It’s sort of like the touch screen on an iPhone,” Chen said. “There’s different notes, which activate from pressing your finger on the wires.”</p>\n<p>According to Chen, the piano costs less than $30 and will allow individuals who are unable to afford pianos to learn and play at an affordable price.</p>\n<p>“The second part of this is that let’s say you want some piano lessons without actually paying the price for them,” Chen said. “Well, if you press this one wire, it will send a signal to a computer to a different piano. So you could essentially teach someone how to play piano with only two of these paper pianos — you don’t need a real one.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60369\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60369\" data-attachment-id=\"60369\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/ucsb-hackathon-draws-participants-sponsors-from-across-state/sb-hacks-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SB-Hacks-9.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"Live music accompanied the hackathon as students wait and rest.

But the story goes deeper than that. The match was mired in controversy for both teams, and volunteer Head Referee Mike Kampmeinert, a Folsom, Calif. Native, broke any ref’s golden rule by taking the game into his own hands. Regardless of the outcome, Sunday’s game highlights the issue of inconsistent officiating in college soccer, and something needs to be done about it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Here’s what I saw, and what the rest of the video shows in part: Gaucho midfielder Luis Silva comes in with an aggressive slide-tackle on the ball around the feet of UC Berkeley’s Servando Carrasco. After losing control of the ball, Carrasco shove-punches Silva above the neck and Silva goes down. Carrasco goes down as well, and both players are awarded cards. This is where the problems begin.</p>\n<p>Did Silva deserve a red card for the play? I don’t claim to know much about college soccer and the intricacies of its rules, but he certainly made a hard, physical play on the ball and it’s understandable for Carrasco to be angry in what was a heated match for both teams. But the red card forced UCSB to close out the next 75 minutes of the game a man down, and an important man at that. Honestly? I’m not sure if Silva’s behavior merited ejection or not. Carrasco’s case, on the other hand, is much simpler. Here’s the official NCAA rulebook’s take on fighting:</p>\n<p>12.6.1 Fighting. Definition:  A fight is defined as a deliberate strike or punch or an attempt to strike or punch another player, official, coach or bench personnel. These acts include, but are not limited to, kicking, head-butting, hair pulling or an open-handed strike if done deliberately and in a malicious manner.</p>\n<p>12.6.1.1 A player, coach or bench personnel shall be ejected if he or she is guilty of fighting or leaves the coaching area to participate in an altercation.</p>\n<p>The rules are clear. Carrasco should have been gone, at least making the game an even 10-on-10 with Silva’s red card. Despite Kampmeinert’s call, midfielder Michael Tetteh managed to put the undermanned Gauchos up 1-0 late in the game off of a throw in, and it seemed as if karma would take care of things, but it wasn’t to be.</p>\n<p>Carrasco returned to the center of the action with just two minutes remaining when he evened up the score after a handball was called in the box. He was awarded a penalty kick, which he buried, sending the match into overtime. I was sitting in the distant press box at the time, so I am no judge of the play, but sophomore midfielder Machael David tells me that the game tape shows no such violation. You can choose for yourself to take that or leave it.</p>\n<p>The controversy continued even after the final whistle blew in overtime, giving Cal the 2-1 victory and sending UCSB packing. Three Gauchos — David, Tetteh and midfielder Danny Barrera — charged the referee, and Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg was forced to restrain his players in the chaos that ensued. Each was rightfully awarded a red card according to the above definition of fighting, and they may see further implications.</p>\n<p>There were a lot of dubious plays on Sunday, and I don’t claim to act as the definitive account as to what happened because I couldn’t clearly see a lot of them from the press box above the field. What I did see, from a very good vantage point in fact, was Vom Steeg’s press conference after the game.</p>\n<p>There, I saw a man that was visibly shaken by what had happened. His voice was hoarse, but his words were clear.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been coaching Division I soccer for 12 years, and what I had to experience out there on the field was not fair for me, was not fair to my coaching staff, was not fair to my players. And I know exactly what I’m saying,” Vom Steeg said. “For $500 [to pay a referee], we can’t find somebody better? Really, we can’t? Five-hundred bucks? It’s not worth it to the players and the teams? I have a team that’s devastated, and there’s nothing that I can say.”</p>\n<p>On a day when a lot of players, Gauchos and Golden Bears alike, were wrong in their actions, Vom Steeg was right. The fact is, Kampmeinert took over the game and had an effect on its outcome. What’s more, he affected players who deserve the right to a game that is decided by those players and nothing else.</p>\n<p>Mistakes this egregious simply don’t happen in college football or basketball. The referees in the playoffs of those sports aren’t chosen based on how close they live to the match. College soccer’s governing bodies need to work to find a system that rotates referees, and only uses the most highly-rated ones in the most important matches.</p>\n<p>David called me the morning after the game, saying he was unable to sleep or go to class, that he felt as if a part of his soul was taken away. He said that calls like those would never stand in his native Africa or in Europe and even suggested corruption in a bad system was what robbed his team of a real chance at a national title. Senior defender Michael Boxall, whom I’ve never known to speak disparagingly of refs, said it was as if Cal had 12 players on the field, one with a whistle. Even Big Mike of the Gaucho locos had to be consoled by Chancellor Yang afterward.</p>\n<p>NCAA soccer is missing an important opportunity because of the standards for officiating. To have UCSB — the most important West Coast team by its sheer number of fans — in the College Cup would be huge for soccer in America. People would be able to see a college-level program that has incredibly devoted followers. Gaucho fans on Sunday were far louder than the Berkeley fan base, and that was just a tiny sampling of what this school has to offer. I’m not suggesting that the win be handed to the Gauchos, but they deserve a fair shot at it, something they certainly didn’t get.</p>\n<p>David, Tetteh and Barrera were absolutely wrong to react as they did. Carrasco was wrong to throw a punch as he did. Referee Kampmeinert was wrong, too. The match will go down in Gaucho soccer history as a loss, and that’s the bottom line. But when people look at that in the future, they’re missing a big story about three seniors — goalkeeper Sam Hayden, forward Joe Eubanks and Boxall — who finish their careers in Blue not with their heads held high, but in shock. This is a story about a team that was literally constructed over the last few years for the purpose of making a championship run this year at Harder Stadium. In sports losing is losing, and that’s tough sometimes. But Sunday’s match, on both sides of the ball — I’m not sure should even be called sport, because that would require an outcome based on athletic performance, not a conveniently located referee.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/blown-call-hopes-dashed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/blown-call-hopes-dashed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/blown-call-hopes-dashed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/blown-call-hopes-dashed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/blown-call-hopes-dashed/","id":2898,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[2897,2896,2895],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Econ Dept.

The economics department has not yet decided specific areas for allocating the $5 million.</p>\n<p>Economics Department manager Kenneth Freeland said the donations from Aster have been cumulatively given to the university through his estate, and the main gift came this past December and consisted of $1.3 million.</p>\n<p>“This is coming through in all sort of varying amounts over time,” Freeland said. “They range from about 100k to around 4 million, so we have gotten several distributions and are expecting more. We got one over Christmas break, which is money we didn’t even know about that came in at about 1.3 million.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeland, the money will go to an Endowed Chair, to be called the Aster Chair to honor Richard Aster.<br>\n“We can hire a very senior, you know, kind of high level, renowned economist to have an Endowed Chair here with the money,” Freeland said.</p>\n<p>Vice Chair of the Economics Department Kelly Bedard said donor money affects the campus as a whole and not simply the economics department.</p>\n<p>“Donor money is used in a variety of ways on campus broadly — it is not unique to economics — to do a variety of things,” Bedard said. “One thing is to have what are called endowed chairs to attract nationally known scholars and hiring people doing important work in whatever area that we happen to be talking about that is beneficial to the campus and the students.”</p>\n<p>Bedard also said department faculty will decide where the money goes.</p>\n<p>“We give a lot of thought to how it gets allocated and where we think it would have the benefits and so on,” Bedard said. “And of course it is also in consultation with the Dean of Social Science and the Administrators in Cheadle Hall and so on.”</p>\n<p>According to Bedard, economics is among the largest majors at the university and new funds are always welcome.<br>\n“We are certainly one of the biggest if not the biggest,” Bedard said. “I think most years we are the biggest, but you know things do fluctuate.”</p>\n<p>Economics department Academic Personnel Specialist Anne Ellis said the money can be used to host talks for students, and right now they have three lecture series: the Philip Babcock Lecture Fund, the Herb Kay Lecture and the Carl Snyder Memorial Lecture.</p>\n<p>“They all have a different emphasis, so the Babcock one has more of an undergraduate emphasis, so there is a couple undergraduates students who get to choose the speakers so it is more geared towards the undergraduates,” Ellis said. “Herb Kay is more of a business related one, it’s usually a prominent business person, it is not necessary a professor or something, they have a business, and Snyder is usually a very high level economist, so someone famous in the economist world.”</p>\n<p>Freeland said the Graduate Student Administration will be able to make improvements to the facilities and give more financial support to the current 107 graduate students.</p>\n<p>“Some of our offices are going to get new paint and new carpet — so the Administrative Offices, so the facilities — because the university doesn’t have a lot of money to really make fancy facilities,” Freeland said. “Some of the money is going to go to graduate student support, so we are going to spin off some money that we can use to offer to Ph.D. students and to provide financial support for grad students.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeland, it is because of donors such as Aster that undergraduates have a career center that is unlike those of most campuses.</p>\n<p>“We have an undergraduate career center, which is unusually unique for campuses. Some schools have new graduate career centers — we actually have an undergraduate career center which focuses on our accounting students because even though we are not a business school, the degree is a professional degree and a lot of our students actually have permanent job offers by the end of their junior year,” Freeland said.</p>\n<p>A series of lectures will be funded by Aster’s donations towards public lectures for speakers, students, faculty and staff that are free and open to people in the community.</p>\n<p>“The department is doing more public lectures and inviting people in who are business leaders, from alumni who have been very successful and also Nobel Laureates and people who are very famous economists,” Freeland said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Total enrollment for the Latino student population count includes both full- and part-time undergraduate and graduate students currently at the university.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics major Irlanda Martinez said it’s more common for community colleges and state schools to become HSI’s due to public schools’ tendency to be affordable.</p>\n<p>“Given the socio-economic factors most Latinas and Latinos face in the United States, a significant part of our community follows the community college route like me or attends a Cal State due to the more affordable prices of education there,” Martinez said. “Because of this, it is common for community colleges and Cal States to become HSI’s.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the university’s population has been rising, this year surpassing the 25 percent minimum to qualify for the HSI title.</p>\n<p>“Just this year, the Latina/o attendance at UCSB rose to approximately 27 percent, which automatically defined it as an HSI,” Martinez said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, this “automatic definition” is only for HACU and any additional funding would have to come from the Department of Education based on the percentage of students who receive financial assistance and an Educational and General Expenditures Requirement based on per capita expenditures.</p>\n<p>“Both of these requirements were not met by UCSB because we have students who are very well-off, and the averages are thrown off,” Martinez said in an email. “UCSB is in the process of waiving those requirements, which is likely to happen because it is somewhat rare for an institution at the level of UCSB to become defined as an HSI through the Department of Education.”</p>\n<p>Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of HACU John Moder said the Latino-serving organization was formed in response to the underrepresentation of Hispanics in academics.</p>\n<p>“We were founded by a group of colleges and universities that had large numbers of Hispanic students and realized that there was no organization that spoke for that institution,” Moder said. “So in 1986, that group created the first definition of a Hispanic serving based on enrollment.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>HSI status opens up resources for all students, staff and faculty, so it will just help us become even stronger. – Professor of Chicana/o Studies Gerardo Aldana</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Moder, if the university accepts the title of HSI, it will have to increase its overall student involvement.</p>\n<p>“It is going to result in better services, better teaching … for all the students that are there,” Moder said, “So although we talked about it being a Hispanic Serving Institution, I don’t think you can really be Hispanic serving without also kind of upping your game for everybody.”</p>\n<p>Professor of Chicana/o Studies and Anthropology and Associate Dean of College of Creative Studies Gerardo Aldana said the recognition will allow more resources to be allocated to education and leadership skills development on campus.</p>\n<p>“HSI status opens up resources for all students, staff and faculty, so it will just help us become even stronger,” Aldana said. “To me, that is a very important message, especially as the demographics of California shift and the need for a diverse educated workforce and leadership increases.”</p>\n<p>According to Aldana, the Department of Chicana/o Studies is part of the university’s commitment to diversity reflected in the HSI status.</p>\n<p>“Our population of Chicana/o and Latina/o students has consistently increased across campus at the same time that our scholarship and academic rankings have increased,” Aldana said. “UCSB demonstrates that it is not one or the other.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
