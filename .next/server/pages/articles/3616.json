The UConsent campaign is a UC-wide initiative proposed by UCSA in 2014 to support student survivors of sexual assault through education and advocacy.</p>\n<p>According to UCSA Undergraduate Chair and third-year sociology and education double-major and External Vice President (EVP) at UC Davis Sam Alavi, the board worked hard to solidify the rubric which will be used to evaluate on-campus mental health services. Alavi said the rubric will include total wait time to see a counselor, the total number of Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) counselors available and whether or not the C.A.P.S. building is accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“We figure out what is right and wrong with the mental health services, we give them a grade and then we give them solutions to have them improve their services and help raise their grade,” Alavi said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Mohsin Mirza said the meeting began with a discussion about what other campuses have done in conjunction with their C.A.P.S. centers.</p>\n<p>“We are beginning to quantify the data that we’ve gathered so that we can better advocate for the solutions that our students need,” said Mirza.</p>\n<p>According to Alavi, the UConsent campaign advocates for a diverse set of counselors who can relate and provide help to various students seeking help.</p>\n<p>“We want to make sure that these conversations are as intersectional as they can be and so the statistics are not whitewashed,” Alavi said. “Part of this is talking about how certain communities face more sexual assault than others and training staff members to work with students who are undocumented or transgender so that they can support their identities.”</p>\n<p>According to Alavi, students felt UCSA did not prioritize sexual assault enough, which motivated the board to create a plan for preventative education about sexual assault on college campuses. Alavi also said the board is pushing for UC Office of the President (UCOP) to host a peer-to-peer training symposium where students across the UC system come together to look at the best practices for consent training.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we’ve done is pressure the regents and president Napolitano to mandate sexual assault prevention education,” Alavi said. “We believe that if we can start having these conversations, we can prevent a lot of the sexual assaults that happen, instead of focusing on dealing with their aftermath.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he is hopeful of the accomplishments to come as the year progresses.</p>\n<p>“The level of dedication and planning that we have done these past board meetings makes me optimistic that we are going to make our students very proud,” Mirza said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

and organizations across the UC to add a Student Regent Adviser position as part of his Shared Governance Initiative.</p>\n<p>Oved’s initiative aims to increase student representation on the UC Board of Regents through an appointed position, which would belong to a student from a different level of education than the elected student regent. Currently, Oved, an undergraduate student at UCLA, holds the only voting Student Regent position for the 2015-2016 term. UC Riverside graduate student Marcela Ramirez serves as the Student Regent-designate, a non-voting position, and will be the 2016-2017 Student Regent. If Oved successfully establishes the adviser position, he hopes to ultimately secure a new Student Regent voting position on the Board of Regents.</p>\n<p>According to Oved, UC students suffer a “lack of representation” on the Board of Regents, and he hopes to combat this underrepresentation with the new student position.</p>\n<p>“We’re 246,000 students with two seats and only one vote,” Oved said. “It’s ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>According to External Vice-President for Statewide Affairs, University of California Student Association (UCSA) Undergraduate Committee Chair and fourth-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza, the Regents fail to represent UC students with their decisions.</p>\n<p>“The UC Regents govern the University and unfortunately seem to be very out of touch with the issues facing students when making decisions that affect their lives,” Mirza said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Oved, past student Regents have pushed for another voting student board member and have not been successful. Oved said by first creating the adviser position, the Initiative will provide a foundation for the later establishment of a voting position.</p>\n<p>“It was really important for me to lay a framework and groundwork so we can really carry on the momentum that’s built every single year,” Oved said. “That’s why we crafted the Shared Governance Initiative, which is a multi-prong approach to increasing shared governance at the UC.”</p>\n<p>Last year, Oved served as the Student Regent-designate with Student Regent Sadia Saifuddin, a UC Berkeley undergraduate at the time. Oved said having two undergraduates representing all UC students was problematic when trying to address challenges unique to graduate and professional students.</p>\n<p>“As much as we studied about the issues of graduate students and professional students across the board, we still couldn’t really speak to the experience of a graduate student or a professional student, especially since they vary greatly from discipline to discipline,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>Oved said student governments on individual UC campuses change every year, and one goal of the initiative is to create a long-term plan that will keep momentum going for a new Student Regent position.</p>\n<p>“What we’re looking to do is try to defeat the leadership turnover and [ensure] that we have a long term plan that will make us effective at accomplishing,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Graduate Student Association External Vice President and UCSA Board Vice-Chair Yanira Rivas Pineda, the Regents often do not address issues pertaining to graduate students, a problem Oved’s Initiative could remedy.</p>\n<p>“Two years ago I remember talking with Avi about how important it is to have graduate students’ voices represented because our needs oftentimes go unheard,” Pineda said in an email. “Having two student Regents will ensure that we have more student representation and hopefully have an undergraduate and graduate representative.”</p>\n<p>According to Oved, tuition and financial aid policy discussions among the Board of Regents are often focused on undergraduates, but graduate and professional students face fee increases as well.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have as robust of a financial aid policy for our professional students as we do for undergrad students,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>According to Pineda, the most recent UC budget deal raises Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition for many professional students.</p>\n<p>“Many of us are no longer have access to traditional financial aid packages, like Cal grants, Federal grants, and subsidized student loans,” Pineda said in an email. “Many of us have families that we need to provide for as well and those of us who took out private student loans as undergrads are actually paying student loans while we’re in schools.”</p>\n<p>Oved said adding a new student adviser position will create change regarding problems that graduates and undergraduates both face, such as diversity, food security and tuition.</p>\n<p>“The Student Regent position has the access to key admin., to the Regents, to critical information and data that is otherwise not open to the general public,” Oved said. “They have ability to sustain long-term relationships and navigate the bureaucracy of the UC to really contribute meaningful change.”</p>\n<p>According to Pineda, graduate and professional students need UC-level representation to address challenges pertaining to issues such as mental health and financial stability.</p>\n<p>“A recent well-being report from UC Berkeley revealed that 47% of its PhDs and 37% of Master’s/Professional students score as depressed, so we know that mental health is an issue as well, on top of more specific graduate needs like student-advisor relationships, massive student loans and job security when we finish our program,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Oved, the UC Council of Presidents, both graduate and undergraduate, UCSA and Student Regent-designate Marcela Ramirez support the Initiative.</p>\n<p>“We’re starting to see a domino effect because now individual associations are passing resolutions in support of this item,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>Despite support from student organizations, Oved said he has faced opposition from the Board of Regents.</p>\n<p>“We are opposed because we have a fundamental disagreement about having more students at the table,” Oved said. “Some people use the excuse of not having enough space on the board. Some people say they don’t want to dilute the voting student Regent. Some people just disagree with the effect it will have on the board.”</p>\n<p>Despite opposition, Oved said he will keep working to implement the Initiative.</p>\n<p>“It’s my job now, with the collective effort of the students, to inform [the Regents] that this is no longer a question of whether we should do it or not,” Oved said. “It’s when we should do it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65298\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65298\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/","id":3613,"author":{"id":251,"name":"Naomi Stolpner"},"related":[3612,3611,3610],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSA Meeting Addresses Student Debt, Improving Communication Between Students and Regents","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/UCSA.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/UCSA.png?resize=796%2C411&ssl=1","description":"The University of California Student Association (UCSA) held a board meeting to discuss several issues concerning UC students Saturday and Sunday at UC Riverside.

UCSA meets monthly, and in its October meeting discussed the goals of the Student Advocacy, Governance, and Engagement (S.A.G.E.) fee, Million Student March, developing the role of Student Advocate to the Regents (StARs) and communications with the UC Office of the President.</p>\n<p>S.A.G.E. is a proposal that would establish a UC-wide, voluntary opt-out fee of six dollars per student to fund UCSA and is set to be established at the upcoming November Regents meeting. The Million Student March is a movement that demands tuition-free public college, cancellation of all student debt and a minimum $15 wage for all campus workers which will take place at campuses across the nation Nov. 12. StARs are UC students who attend Board of Regents meetings held every other month to converse with regents and to present student concerns, and UCSA hopes to increase the presence and influence of StARs at the meetings.</p>\n<p>UCSA President and fourth-year peace and conflict studies major at UC Berkeley Kevin Sabo said UCSA is funded by student associations across the UC campuses, and for individual UC’s to receive the benefits of UCSA at the state level the associations must pay their membership dues. According to Sabo, the SAGE fee would better connect students and decision makers.</p>\n<p>“Really what S.A.G.E. does is there is a lot of difficulties with students being able to get access to decision makers,” Sabo said. “With S.A.G.E., the UCSA would be able to really eliminate that barrier of accessibility and get students before those decision makers.”</p>\n<p>Sabo said students who are interested in going to Sacramento to lobby may have troubles paying for transportation and other expenses. According to Sabo, S.A.G.E. will allow UCSA to “spend more effectively.”</p>\n<p>“They have to front the cost to participate and then wait several weeks, even months, to get reimbursed,” Sabo said. “S.A.G.E. is really about stabilizing the organization, giving a better, more predictable outlook on what revenues are going to be like so we can budget for things like taking students to lobby on things like student loan debt or the Perkins Loans.”</p>\n<p>UCSA campus action vice chair and UCSB fourth-year global studies major Dana Patterson said the Million Student March is a “unique opportunity” to address the growing problem of student debt in the United States. According to Patterson, tuition freezes are not enough.</p>\n<p>“Every person in our community is affected by student debt,” Patterson said. “Student debt is greater than credit card debt … It has tripled in the last 10 years … education needs to be free, mainstream, and make politicians talk about it.”</p>\n<p>According to Patterson, the board meeting was “100 percent a success,” and UCSA passed a resolution for the UCs to contribute to the efforts of the Million Student March on individual campuses. Patterson said she encourages students across the nation to participate in the Million Student March at their campus.</p>\n<p>“This is for every student to get involved, and I encourage any who wants to join this movement to come,” Patterson said.</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley graduate student Iman Sylvain said StARs are allowed to provide comments at UC Regents Board meetings and meet with Regents in private settings such as in break rooms or while getting lunch.</p>\n<p>“We have a wonderful program that gives students a back door access to the ability to really interface genuinely with the Regents, because they are kind of an elusive group,” Sylvain said.</p>\n<p>Sylvain said StARs representatives are able to advocate for issues relevant to UC students.</p>\n<p>“We’ve talked about student homelessness, we’ve talked about renewing the act for sexual assault prevention training for faculties, we also talked about mental health and the cost of living has been huge,” Sylvain said.</p>\n<p>According to Sylvain, UCSA is working on developing more personal relationships with Regents through StARs in order for the Regents to better understand the student perspective.</p>\n<p>“For example, the housing crisis — you can see that, you can see students sleeping in their cars or showering at the gym,” Sylvain said. “The Regents are very removed from the on-campus situation … So we are trying to engage [the Regents] in different ways.”</p>\n<p>According to Sylvain, UCSA is “only” scheduled to meet with the UC Office of the President three hours a year.</p>\n<p>“We are definitely pushing for the president to take more meetings and to have more ongoing conversations with them,” Sylvain said. “What are the ways to be in constant communication with the Office of the President?”</p>\n<p>Sylvain said UCSA advocates for a “genuine” shared government between administration, faculty and students.</p>\n<p>“Why don’t we have a vote — why don’t we have a say when it comes to decision making?” Sylvain said. “We want more than just our ‘foot in the door;’ we want a seat at the table.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

A vice chancellor at the school resigned in April 2015 amid allegations of sexual harassment, and <a href=\"http://www.dailycal.org/2016/03/10/berkeley-law-dean-resigns-amid-sexual-harassment-allegations-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier in March</a>, the dean of UC Berkeley’s School of Law resigned after a campus investigation found he had violated the university’s sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>“It was just time to say look, the sanctions need to match the seriousness of the behavior that’s substantiated,” Napolitano said in the radio interview. “We just don’t tolerate this kind of activity at the University of California, be it at Berkeley or be it at any other campus.”</p>\n<p>Under the new policy, sanctions imposed on administrators in these positions would need to be reviewed by the committee, which would then send its recommendation to the campus chancellor.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As before the committee’s creation, Napolitano will have the final say as to how senior leaders are reprimanded.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
