And the Giants are definitely not one of them… kidding! Only kidding. I fully realize the intense love that over half of the student body at UCSB feels for this talented group of goofballs, led by none other than a guy dubbed “the Freak.” However, the Giants, in their Halloween-themed uniforms, have one pumpkin in particularto thank for their postseason success.</p>\n<p>I am here to shed light on the little spark that is Cody Ross. Over time, fans of baseball have come to expect a certain something when the fall classic hits. I am talking about each team’s Mr. October. Sometimes he varies per series, sometimes he is consistent throughout the entire playoffs, but he is always there. Often a come-from-nowhere type guy, each team’s Mr. October seems to hit his stride just in time to lift his team, his fans, and his city to championship fervor.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Cody Ross is that such player for the Giants. Dismissed with the wave of a hand by the lowly Florida Marlins, the Giants are his fifth major league team in seven years. However, he seems to like where he landed, as his stats in the 2010 postseason show that he’ll be an honorary NorCal bro until the end. In seven games, he has four homeruns, seven RBI, eight hits, a .350 hitting percentage, and a .435 on base percentage. Whenever Ross steps up to the plate, he is as sure to get on or around the basesas Lindsay Lohan is to wind up in jail again.</p>\n<p>And Ross isn’t hitting off Grandma Jo over there. No, sir. He is hitting home runs off of such pitching legends as the Phillies’ two Roy’s, Halladay and Oswalt. Just a mere four hours ago, he drove in a run off of pitching ace Cole Hamels, the one-time boy wonder. Ross has not only outperformed both his competition and teammates, but he is straight up trumping the usual heavy-hitters. Ryan Howard, the Philly bomber, has registered zero HR’s in the playoffs. Jimmy Rollins, always a consistent hitter, has  four RBI’s and three hits, but only a .286 on base percentage. Ross’ teammate, Aubrey Huff, known for his RBI prowess over the past season, has only one RBI thus far, with a .217 hitting average.</p>\n<p>Who knows how long Ross will be boss of the Bay? Maybe he’s simply best kept secret in this perfect bubble of the playoffs, separate from any other time in the long, enduring baseball season. Or maybe he’ll ignite into a late-blooming Hall of Famer. Whichever it is, for this moment, in this postseason, Ross rules.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

The office of EVPLA primarily concerns university and student relations with Isla Vista and the surrounding areas. The EVPLA office negotiates with campus administration regarding parking for Halloween and Deltopia, consults with local law enforcement agencies and distributes important information regarding I.V. and its surrounding areas to the campus community. In a 50-minute debate, the candidates for EVPLA were asked questions about what issues they would address and how they would address them if elected.</p>\n<p>One of the issues brought up during the EVPLA debate was student housing, particularly the high cost of living in I.V.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This used to be an activist community until the ’70s when Reagan came in and pretty much crushed that spirit. I think that we should foster that activism spirit once again. – Brandon Morse of the Free Thinking Patriots (FTP) Party</p></blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_62394\" style=\"width: 325px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPLA_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1659405711\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62405\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62394\" data-attachment-id=\"62394\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/evpla_stephen-manga-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPLA_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Brandon Morse tells the story of how he managed to get by without adequate housing\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428967399\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"EVPLA\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Brandon Morse tells the story of how he managed to get by without adequate housing&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPLA_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPLA_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62394\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPLA_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=315%2C473\" alt=\"Brandon Morse tells the story of how he managed to get by without adequate housing.

This is something we have been pushing for years because the county is continuing to underserve our community. – Paola Dela Cruz of the Open People’s Party (OPP)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Answering a question about Assemblymember Das Williams’ self-governance bill AB-3, Dela Cruz said she was a strong proponent of the legislation.</p>\n<p>“Since the very first day that Assembly Bill 3 was introduced, I have been part of the dialogues and meetings that have taken place in our local community,” Dela Cruz said. “I am in full support of this bill. I believe that our community needs self-governance in Isla Vista. This is something we have been pushing for years because the county is continuing to underserve our community.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, the structural changes outlined by AB-3 are not enough to incite change in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t do nearly enough,” Morse said. “I think that it’s a way to appease the students at this particular point in time. What we really need is representation, and the way that we get representation is through cityhood, not through the current structure.”</p>\n<p>In regard to addressing rape culture on campus, Dela Cruz said there have been a lack of programs to educate students about sexual violence at the university and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I will make sure that a yearlong sexual assault campaign is launched in Isla Vista because it is extremely disappointing that our university has never launched a sexual assault campaign,” Dela Cruz said. “I will make sure as the EVPLA I address this.”</p>\n<p>Morse said he wants to bring back the activism culture of I.V. in the ’60s and channel efforts toward anti-rape culture.</p>\n<p>“This used to be an activist community until the ’70s when Reagan came in and pretty much crushed that spirit,” Morse said. “I think that we should foster that activism spirit once again.”</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62393\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1877346452\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62405\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62393\" data-attachment-id=\"62393\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/charles-carlos-lopez-describes-how-ucs-are-unequally-financially-represented/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Charles \\\"Carlos\\\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428970937\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"91\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"Charles \\\"Carlos\\\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"EVPSA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62393\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt='EVPSA Candidate Charles \"Carlos\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented.

The candidates for EVPSA answered questions which focused on advocating for students’ interests on the state level, discussing funding issues within the UC and collaboration with the University of California Student Association (UCSA).</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we work more closely with others working for the same goals as us across the state, we can be far more effective than when we meet just once a month for a board meeting. – Independent Candidate Mohsin Mirza</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mirza said he would work with existing lobby groups to pressure the state government to increase funding for the UC and push the UC system to slow growth spending.</p>\n<p>“I have been working within the association’s Lobby Corps and also in a number of clubs and OSL groups, and I feel like engaging with them will be one of the most important things I can do if elected,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Lopez said educating UC students and California residents is the best way to create change in the UC system.</p>\n<p>“I believe the most effective way we can fight back against cutbacks in our system and raises in tuition is to advocate for average students to know what’s going on, because when average students understand the systems that affect them and the ways that they affect them, their parents and friends will understand,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Referring to UCSA meetings, Mirza said A.S should be working with UCSA members throughout the year rather than once a month on issues facing higher education across the state.</p>\n<p>“If we work more closely with others working for the same goals as us across the state, we can be far more effective than when we meet just once a month for a board meeting,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Lopez said he would make an effort to involve students in UC Regents meetings and student conferences if elected to office.</p>\n<p>“If I am elected as EVPSA, every time that we go to a conference I am going to put a priority on students that have never been to one,” Lopez said. “When we have a critical mass of students who understand the issues that face them, that’s when we can advocate for real systematic change.”</p>\n<p>Debates for other A.S. positions will continue on Wednesday and Thursday in the Hub. Elections will take place April 20-23 on GOLD.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/","id":2828,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2827,2826,2825],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate in the Old Little Theater and Girvetz 1004, making speeches to the senators concerning the Students for Justice in Palestine’s recent resolution. <em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night in the Old Little Theater and then in Girvetz 1004 to discuss a resolution by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), sponsored by senators Xin Ma and Steven Kwok, which calls for the university to divest from businesses profiting from alleged human rights violations in Palestine.</p>\n<p>Dozens of students signed up to speak during public forum, giving passionate arguments both in support and in opposition of the resolution. UCSB and UC Merced remain the only UC undergraduate campuses whose student governments have not yet passed divestment resolutions, with UC Irvine being the first campus to pass divestment in November 2012.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This resolution never took into account that boycotting businesses affects business decisions that hurt the Palestinians as much if not more than the Israeli economy. Hewlett-Packard, one of the companies on the boycott list, employees hundreds of Palestinians engineers and other people in the technology industry.” – Second-year economics and accounting major Michael Torbati</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sociology graduate student Emily Schneider said students should stand in opposition to the corporations profiting from human rights violations currently being committed via the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>“The problem there is not so much about religion, or other things that we see in the media, but the fact that there’s companies over there profiting off of the cycle of violence and we have the chance here as students to play a role in ending the cycle of violence for both Israelis and Palestinians,” Schneider said.</p>\n<p>Daniel Lifton, president of Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi, said that the Palestinian Civil Society’s international call for a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has unreasonable demands that target Israel’s existence.</p>\n<p>“The demands that BDS calls for amount to the destruction of Israel it’s as simple as that,” Lifton said. “The generally agreed upon solution to this conflict is a peaceful two-state solution. I want peace; I want an Israeli state, and I want a Palestinian state.”</p>\n<p>First-year global studies major Marjan Abubu said he is in support of the resolution and called on Senate to stand up on behalf of people oppressed by corporations named in the resolution.</p>\n<p>“We have the power to voice our opinions therefore we must speak out for those who cannot,” Abubu said. “Our unified voices cry out to denounce corporations that profit from cruelty and brutality.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Michael Torbati said the resolution is an attack on Israel and may have unintended consequences.</p>\n<p>“Israeli existence is questioned daily. No other nation has to deal with the constant threat of annihilation from multiple fronts. It may not seem like it, but we are standing at one of these fronts right now,” Torbati said. “This resolution never took into account that boycotting businesses affects business decisions that hurt the Palestinians as much if not more than the Israeli economy. Hewlett-Packard, one of the companies on the boycott list, employees hundreds of Palestinians engineers and other people in the technology industry.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I saw most of you running for platforms advocating for campus and social change. You all stand at a crossroads of continuing a tradition of activism and social justice that is the very reason that many of you can sit at these seats today. – Second-year math major Alonso Martinez</p></blockquote>\n<p>First-year biology major Michelle May said if the resolution were passed, it would alienate the campus’s large Jewish student population.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has the largest Jewish population of any UC, therefore clearly the Jewish community feels comfortable being here and discussing that they are Jewish,” May said.</p>\n<p>“This resolution alienates the Jewish community. There is no reason to pass a resolution that diminishes the happiness of such a large student population.”</p>\n<p>Second-year math major Alonso Martinez encouraged the Senate to pass the divestment resolution near the end of public forum by putting the BDS movement into the historical context of past social justice struggles.</p>\n<p>“As George William, a German philosopher once said, ‘The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history.’ Will you be the Senators that prove him wrong?” Martinez asked.</p>\n<p>Martinez said the opportunity to pass the divestment resolution was in the tradition of past student-initiated changes such as Black Student Union’s call for changes to the ethnic studies program to accurately reflect the UC demographic and protests against UC complicity with the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>“I saw most of you running for platforms advocating for campus and social change,” Martinez said. “You all stand at a crossroads of continuing a tradition of activism and social justice that is the very reason that many of you can sit at these seats today.”</p>\n<p>As of press time, no vote had been made on the resolution.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on the page 6 of Thursday, April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The family will be there 4–7 p.m. and refreshments will follow the ceremony.</p>\n<p>Stone’s friends from Chi Delta Theta will hold a candlelight vigil in her honor on Wednesday, March 11, beginning at 6 p.m. in Storke Plaza.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61763\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-10/ccs-lit-major-nexite-passes-away/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61763\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-10/ccs-lit-major-nexite-passes-away/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-10/ccs-lit-major-nexite-passes-away/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-10/ccs-lit-major-nexite-passes-away/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-10/ccs-lit-major-nexite-passes-away/","id":2830,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2829,2828,2827],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
