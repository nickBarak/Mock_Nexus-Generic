Across the previous two years, Campus United (CU) had won seven of the eight available partisan executive seats.</p>\n<p>Campus United remains dominant in the A.S. Senate, after students elected 14 Campus United candidates and 10 from IVP.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Election Board, 8,233 undergraduate students, or 39.7 percent, voted in the election. This is the highest voter turnout since 2014.</p>\n<p>Students voted against the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/newcen-to-create-innovation-lab-pedestrian-path/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NewCen renovation project</a> with an 81.69 percent no vote. The project had drawn widespread controversy across A.S. and on social media, largely due to the project’s costs.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited and thrilled that the students had the opportunity to voice their opinion on this issue,” said Hieu Le, current A.S. president and one of the project’s primary supporters. “We need to listen to what the students have to say in terms of supporting a different funding model for it, and that’s something that I stand by.”</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel was elected as the next A.S president and is the lone executive candidate elected from CU.</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, the Isla Vista Party’s candidate for president, said he is undeterred by the loss.</p>\n<p>“It’s not as tough a loss as I think a lot of people think it was,” he said. “People really showed up for us. We had a lot of votes in every category; I’m super proud of all the effort everyone’s put in. It was never about me, and it never will be about me.”</p>\n<p>Dumlao also said he will continue to make change on campus and said he believes the election has encouraged more students from all backgrounds to get involved at the university.</p>\n<p>“For all the unrepresented students out there, for all the queer students, for all the brown students, for all the Pacific Islanders, there’s a spot for you out there,” he said. “Last quarter, the quarter before that, every quarter I’ve been here, I always think I don’t belong here at UCSB. And this race has really shown me that we do belong here.”</p>\n<p>Steven Ho with IVP won the internal vice president position against CU’s Anthony Pimentel by 636 raw votes. Ho is currently an on-campus senator in A.S. senate. Ho and Pimentel declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico of CU and off-campus senator lost to IVP’s Jeike Meijer by nearly 600 raw votes for external vice president of local affairs. Meijer has said she will be the first Native American to serve as a UCSB A.S. executive. Dycaico and Meijer declined to comment.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Mayela Morales won the external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) position against Madeline Loudon of CU. Both candidates declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Rose Ettleson lost the vote for student advocate general (S.A.G.) against Grecia Martinez. Ettleson told the Nexus she was not “afraid of any candidate winning” because she believes everyone is competent and qualified.</p>\n<p>“I’m ecstatic about the whole executive slate because every single one is going to do such amazing things. I’m obviously disappointed; I think Grecia will be a great student advocate general,” Ettleson said.</p>\n<p>“I am relieved, ecstatic — it’s been a very long two weeks,” Martinez said after the win. She said she was excited to work with the current S.A.G., Jack Tannenbaum, to analyze statistics behind the election results to see where the students fall on campus issues.</p>\n<p>At a somber post-election meeting, CU party leaders urged those who fell short of elected seats to remain hopeful and active.</p>\n<p>“When I look at all of you here, as a fourth-year exec, you know what I see? I see the future of this fucking campus!” Kristin Hsu, the current EVPSA, told the party. “This is not Associated Students United, this is Campus United!”</p>\n<p>“Whatever happened in there — fuck that!” she added.</p>\n<p>Kopel thanked the CU staffers for their help in her victory and echoed Hsu in telling the party to not give up their fight.</p>\n<p>“Campus United needs to stay united,” she said. “No matter what happens in there, we are the people who are best for this campus … We will come back again, and we will sweep again and again and again, no matter how long it takes.”</p>\n<p>A photo story from the night can be seen <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/in-photos-a-s-elections-2018/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence, Sanya Kamidi and Jose Ochoa contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Hsu said “Associated Students United,” not “Soviet Students Union” as previously reported.

previously planned lecture about the industrial revolution for an informational presentation by Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) along with a lecture about sexual assault throughout history.</p>\n<p>“I would have not brought it up if it were not a problem on campus today,” he said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> on Monday.</p>\n<p>Spickard said he felt he was teaching within the boundaries of his qualifications as a history professor because sexual assault is a topic that is present throughout history.</p>\n<p>In previous courses, Spickard has taught a “mini-lecture” on sexual assault, but he said due to the continued sexual violence on campuses, he decided to give a full lecture. This is the first time he dedicated a full lecture time slot to the topic of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Within the nationwide college undergraduate student body, approximately “23.1 percent of females and 5.4 percent of males experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or incapacitation,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence\">Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN)</a>.</p>\n<p>Before Spickard began Thursday’s lecture, he told students they were permitted to leave if they were uncomfortable with the sensitive material. About a dozen women and six men left.</p>\n<p>In the presentation, Spickard included examples of perpetrators of sexual violence throughout history, a study of the degree of repentance within rapists’ language and a testimony by a victim.</p>\n<p>Spickard discussed historical sexual assault perpetrators such as the Roman Army in Rome, Kitty Schmidt’s brothel in Germany and Boko Haram in Nigeria. Each presentation slide showed an image of the victims.</p>\n<p>Before he read a victim’s testimony, Spickard warned the class about the subject matter. As he read, some students left in tears.</p>\n<p>“This lecture was hard because I knew I was saying something that would make some people in class uncomfortable because they had a terrible experience,” Spickard said. “I wanted to be as careful as I could be not to add to that.”</p>\n<p>He said he had a conversation with a student who expressed that men are not the only perpetrators of sexual violence. Spickard explained that he focused on men because it is more common for men to be perpetrators.</p>\n<p>According to a 2010 survey on sexual violence by the Center for Disease Control, female rape victims reported that 98 percent of perpetrators of sexual violence were male.</p>\n<p>Approximately 93 percent of male rape victims reported only male perpetrators.</p>\n<p>Spickard said he wanted to educate his students about sexual assault and how it is a part of many people’s lives, but also to confront possible perpetrators with a message they have been ignoring.</p>\n<p>“When I look out the doors of I.V. Theatre, I am reminded of where I am and what happens outside those doors,” he said. “If I’m in this community and a hurtful thing like this keeps happening, then I need to stand on the side of doing something about it.”</p>\n<p>“It is just not okay,” he said repeatedly. “It has to stop.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 4 of the May 3, 2018 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82861\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/professor-switches-lecture-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82861\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/professor-switches-lecture-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/professor-switches-lecture-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/professor-switches-lecture-to-discuss-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/professor-switches-lecture-to-discuss-sexual-assault/","id":2833,"author":{"id":85,"name":"Vivianna Shields"},"related":[2832,2831,2830],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Financial Aid Office Backs Off of Controversial Plan","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rightsaid-PK.jpg?resize=201%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rightsaid-PK.jpg?resize=201%2C303&ssl=1","description":"The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is no longer examining the possibility of reducing financial aid award letters to students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI).","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is no longer examining the possibility of reducing financial aid award letters to students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI).</p>\n<p>An announcement reflecting the change of course to pursue a plan came Wednesday night from On-Campus senator Matthew Santos, stated after weeks of negotiations between Associated Students and the financial aid office. The idea originally involved reducing the portion of financial aid award letters slated for covering the cost of health insurance to students who waive GHI. Discussions between the financial aid office and A.S. yielded no change in the status quo.</p>\n<p>Director of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Mike Miller said in an email to A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau that the idea was to allocate funds more efficiently from students who are not using the fully designated amount for health insurance and redistributing that amount for other purposes.</p>\n<p>“The issue at hand is that approximately 50% of undergraduate students waive out of GHI and their financial aid awards are not adjusted even though the students are not incurring the GHI expense,” Miller said in an email. “Currently, financial aid recipients are able to use those funds to address other expenses. Given the rapid increase in GHI costs over the last few years, this has evolved into a significant issue. Based on our projections of past student history, we estimate a savings of about $6M in UCSB Grant if we make the revisions for GHI waivers.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and GHI advisory committee member Alex Hill said while he understood the financial aid office’s position, he believes the idea was unpopular and stood to affect a large number of students.</p>\n<p>“I understand the business perspective of the financial office and it is necessary to be prudent with any budget to make sure that they aren’t bleeding money. From their perspective, if you’re looking at their budget, they were more or less spending their budget inefficiently and they were trying to be more efficient,” Hill said. “However, their decisions do affect students directly in a way that was grossly unpopular with the student body.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year psychology and sociology double major Ali Guthy said the financial aid office required additional concrete evidence before moving forward with a formal plan on the idea.</p>\n<p>“From our perspective, they lacked specific data about what are student health insurance plans and needs at the time,” Guthy said. “They were making the decision, from my perspective, on a series of interactions with students coming into the financial office, which is good, firsthand experience is really great. But based off of that they needed to conduct a formal survey and focus groups and studies with students.”</p>\n<p>Miller said in a statement that nothing would change regarding financial aid award allocations for health insurance and that the decision was reached after investigation into the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>“After spending time researching the issue and looking into the ever evolving Affordable Care Act and other health insurance options UCSB students have, I determined more time was needed before we could formulate a plan that I felt comfortable with,” Miller said. “Moving forward, there will be many more conversations at the system-wide and campus levels about this issue, but for 2015-16, I have made the decision to continue our current practices.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, a concrete plan to implement reduced award letters for students who waived GHI never existed, and Miller said it was only ever an idea.</p>\n<p>“There was never an agreement to move forward with a plan to adjust financial aid awards for GHI waivers. There were simply conversations with a couple of key departments and AS members,” Miller said in an email. “From day one, we all said we wanted to be thoughtful about the issue before moving forward with a plan.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said she was pleased to hear the financial aid office would no longer consider any plans to reduce award letters and that her office would continue to discuss the financial aid situation with Miller’s office.</p>\n<p>“We have to acknowledge they’re coming from a good place. They really listen to students on this issue and I personally could not be more happy with the outcome,” Guthy said. “Students just need to be aware that this conversation is happening. This conversation will continue to happen in the next couple months.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said she believes student opposition to the idea contributed to the financial aid office’s decision to discontinue consideration on the proposed possible plan.</p>\n<p>“With more talk about it amongst the student population it became very present or obvious that students were not ready nor were they gung-ho about this whole thing,” Lau said, “and that’s why they’re slowing down the process now.”</p>\n<p>According to Jodie Nakajima, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, despite the change of direction taken by the financial aid office, she will still be waiving GHI.</p>\n<p>“I think it depends on how much they would reduce it by, but insurance is pretty expensive anyways … so I probably would still waive it regardless,” Nakajima said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/","id":2834,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2833,2832,2831],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
