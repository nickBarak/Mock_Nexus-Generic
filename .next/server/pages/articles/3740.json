CSD postponed the decision on whether or not to include a low-income exemption with the UUT. <em>Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>I.V. voters passed the User Utility Tax (UUT) through Measure R, which was on the Santa Barbara Spring 2018 elections ballot.</p>\n<p>The UUT, an eight percent tax on electricity, gas, garbage disposal, sewage and water services, is the I.V. Community Services District’s main source of funding. It will <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19_5ItKDEy3CwUFvd-mRuIuIww-VKa3cwgk4pOAD35sM/edit#gid=1092095724\">net</a> approximately $777,000 a year for the district.</p>\n<p>The “Yes on Measure R” crew championed the tax as a way to finally give I.V. residents a voice in government following the district’s creation in Spring 2017.</p>\n<p>Prominent advocates for the tax – including I.V. CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand and I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud – campaigned on the promise of a low-income exemption for those who cannot afford the tax.</p>\n<p>Four months later, that promise remains in stasis.</p>\n<p>Brandt told the Nexus in June that the CSD was currently in the process of finalizing a low-income exemption.</p>\n<p>“If there are households in Isla Vista that cannot afford to pay the tax, even though it is going to be very small, I think that it is very important that we do not put that extra burden on them,” Brandt said in June.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD, which meets twice a month, has discussed the low-income exemption extensively at two of its meetings since UUT’s passing.</p>\n<p>However, the six-member board has not made any progress regarding the exemption and instead has discussed not implementing a low-income exemption for the tax.</p>\n<p>“[Isla Vista] is a poverty hotspot, and as we all know, there is a large student population here that is not exactly rolling in money,” Bertrand said during the district’s Oct. 9 meeting. “It’s hard to grant exemptions to anyone.”</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board members, such as Vice President Natalie Jordan, said it is hard to determine which households in I.V. are low-income because several households only have one name on certain utilities.</p>\n<p>She pointed to her own living situation in I.V. as an example.</p>\n<p>“[My household] receive[s] a discounted rate on electricity already because we have that one [low-income] person written onto the bill,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Other members, such as director Father Jon Hedges, argued all residents should pay the tax because of the voice the I.V. CSD gives the community.</p>\n<p>“The whole premise of the CSD was participatory democracy, a voice for our community, that we not be voiceless the way we’ve been for decades,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that the cost of a small bill per month is a small price to pay.”</p>\n<p>The issue on the table during the Oct. 9 meeting was whether or not to exempt I.V.’s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vQhq8YjtkADsaqdHp8X7JumSONytqJPNLKQdu_csyms/edit#gid=0\">non-profit</a> housing providers, such as Friendship Manor and the SB Housing Co-op. The latter is composed of five houses: Newman, Merton, Bike, Manely and De Shain.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Director George Thurlow argued if one group is allowed to be exempt, such as the non-profits, then it would create problems for everyone.</p>\n<p>“Once we say, ‘Your folks don’t have to pay the four dollars a month,’ you’re gonna open the floodgates, because every student in this town is for [the exemption],” he said.</p>\n<p>The issue was tabled until February 2019, when the district will have a better sense of its finances, according to Hedges.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD is working toward “some sort of exemption or reduction,” though not necessarily a low-income exemption, Bertrand said to the Nexus following the meeting.</p>\n<p>“I wish we would address it now, but we can address it then, too,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“I struggle with this one because while [there is a] small amount of money that would be saved, it’s still something that we really — for the past few years now — mentioned some sort of utility reduction or exemption for low-income folks.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The final quote is attributed Bertrand, not Brandt. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
