","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The chance to avoid its first losing conference record since 2008 has diminished for the UCSB women’s volleyball team after losses to UC Irvine and UC Davis this past weekend. Despite falling behind in the first set, Santa Barbara scrapped its way back into the match by earning the equalizer for a 1-1 tie but the Anteaters managed to prevail for the 3-1 victory in sets of 25-13, 23-25, 25-23, and 25-23. Winning in straight sets of 25-19, 25-18 and 25-14, UC Davis swept the Gauchos for the second time this season.</p>\n<p>“We have too many followers on our team,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We need some people to say ‘look at me, this is what we’re doing and we’re doing it now.’ That’s what we need in those clutch times at the end and that’s what we need moving forward to surprise some teams here down the stretch.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66252\" style=\"width: 376px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1224276317\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66268\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66252\" data-attachment-id=\"66252\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/inability-to-close-sets-leaves-gauchos-frustrated-with-losses-to-uci-uc-davis/emilia-petrachi-returns-a-serve-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WVball_vsUCD-20151106-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Emilia Petrachi returns a serve.

The senior captain had a drop in her performance after 10 kills in last Thursday’s match versus Cal Poly. She finished the weekend with seven kills on 30 attempts, eight errors, and a -.087 hitting percentage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB’s losing woes continue as its slump extended to five matches. The Gauchos are now 6-17 overall and 2-10 in the Big West. Saturday’s victory brings UC Irvine within one win from achieving a .500 record. The Anteaters sit at 12-13, 6-7 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Also just one win away from the neutral winning percentage mark is UC Davis. Arguably its most impressive win of the season, UC Davis is now 13-14 overall, 8-5 in Big West matches after a 3-2 upset over Cal Poly on Saturday and its win over UCSB on Friday.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think the upperclassmen, me and the seniors, need to step it up,” junior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt said. “We need to tell the team ‘this is what we’re going to do and this is how we’re going to do it.’ It’s been a long season but we still have games to go. We can make a change at this point, there’s no reason we can’t step it up.”</p>\n<p>From the match’s beginning, UC Irvine was able to establish its dominance on the offensive end. It opened the first set with a 6-1 lead, forcing a UCSB timeout. The Anteaters took an even more comfortable lead at 17-7, causing another Gauchos’ timeout.</p>\n<p>While UCSB and UCI would go on to exchange points, the Anteaters’ .379 hitting percentage proved to be too much for the Gauchos’ defense.</p>\n<p>After a dismal .000 hitting percentage in the first set, UCSB bounced back with its best attacking performance in the second set. The Gauchos tallied 16 kills to go along with a .316 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s commanding start helped it gain a 12-9 lead but a 5-0 Anteaters’ run led to UC Irvine taking a 14-12 lead. However, the Gauchos responded with a 6-0 run of their own.</p>\n<p>Sparking the Gauchos’ run was the outstanding serving of senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva. Her four consecutive service aces helped give UCSB its 18-14 lead. Villanueva finished with a team-high 11 kills and had 10 digs.</p>\n<p>Adding to Villanueva’s match-high of four aces was Grunt and freshman outside hitter Devin Joos. Grunt led UCSB with a .389 hitting percentage and clocked four of her eight kills in the second set. In spite of her .156 hitting clip, Joos registered nine kills but was most valuable on defense with a match-high three solo blocks.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sustained its lead but not free of pressure from Irvine’s attempt to take the 2-0 lead. Able to force the 23-23 tie, a service error by sophomore setter Emily Blair and an attack error by redshirt senior outside hitter Marisa Bubica allowed the Gauchos to seal the set for the 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>The attacking error was certainly a mistake that Bubica did not forget entering the third set. Although both teams hit poorly in the set, Bubica had nine of her match-high 19 kills in the third set.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCI’s defense played more efficiently in the second half. In spite of being outblocked, Irvine’s 72 digs was its second-most this season.</p>\n<p>Twice did UCSB pull within a one-point deficit but could not capitalize on Irvine’s errors. Earning the Anteaters’ last two kills to take the 25-23 set victory and a 2-1 lead was redshirt sophomore opposite Lena Latour.</p>\n<p>It was a similar scenario in the final set as well. Trailing 6-5, UCSB found some separation with a 5-0 run to take a 10-6 lead and force a UCI timeout.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly after 18 kills the previous night against Cal Poly, freshman opposite Harlee Kekauoha was not in the Anteaters’ starting lineup and did not enter the match until being used as a substitution in the fourth period.</p>\n<p>Irvine’s leader in kills with 307 and kills per set with a 3.34 average, Kekeauoha was perfect despite limited playing time. She finished with six kills on six attempts.</p>\n<p>Irvine trimmed UCSB’s lead and as the match progressed, took a 17-16 lead. Back and forth scoring occurred between both teams, but it seemed like the Gauchos were on their way to victory with a 22-20 lead. But a service error by Villanueva trimmed UCSB’s lead to one and provided UCI with its comeback opportunity. Irvine closed the match with a 5-2 run to earn its 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s troubles on offense stemmed from its .154 hitting clip the night before versus UC Davis. While Santa Barbara contained UC Davis’ senior outside hitter Kaylin Squyres to five kills and a .103 hitting clip in the first meeting, the Gauchos were unsuccessful in their attempt of a repeat performance on Friday.</p>\n<p>She finished with a match-high 13 kills, 14 digs, and a .379 attacking percentage. Junior outside hitter Kendall Walbrecht finished with 10 kills and a .310 hitting average.</p>\n<p>Villanueva led UCSB with 10 kills but was the only Gaucho in double digit figures. It was her third consecutive match with double digit kills but was not enough to prevent the Gauchos from being swept.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road next Friday, Nov. 13<sup>th</sup> at Cal State Fullerton for a primetime matchup on ESPN3 at 4:30 p.m. The Gauchos’ weekend continues with a Saturday match at UC Riverside at 7:30 p.m. Santa Barbara’s two conference wins appeared in home matches against both teams earlier this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The two seniors have combined to score the second-most goals by any tandem in school history and are both in the Top 10 of individual scoring as well.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, worrying about Parks and Snyder on the defensive side isn’t the only problem. The 49ers strong defense has allowed just 5.9 goals per game to opposing teams.</p>\n<p>With only three games remaining in the regular season, the two games that UCSB plays this weekend are extremely important.</p>\n<p>While last weekend’s game resulted in a loss, an excellent second half is something that the Gauchos will look to carry with them into this weekend. After giving up seven goals to Hawaii in the first half, Santa Barbara conceded just one in the entire second half.</p>\n<p>Both Saturday’s match-up against Irvine and Sunday’s contest at Long Beach are set for noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of April 10, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54764\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-prep-for-pair-of-ranked-opponents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54764\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-prep-for-pair-of-ranked-opponents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-prep-for-pair-of-ranked-opponents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-prep-for-pair-of-ranked-opponents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-prep-for-pair-of-ranked-opponents/","id":5078,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5077,5076,5075],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Earn First Conference Win, End 11 Match Losing Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVolleyball-12-of-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVolleyball-12-of-20-web.jpg?resize=600%2C401&ssl=1","description":"In its return to the Thunderdome, UCSB women's volleyball earned its first conference and home victories of the season.

Past games have kind of been like, ‘what is going on, why can’t we do this?’ But tonight was a reminder that not all hope is loss, we’re going to figure this out. It’s still early in conference and we have to keep reminding ourselves that.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s 3-1 victories over UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton this weekend reflected the winning team that we all witnessed in the beginning of the season. Along with ending their winless streak, UCSB earned its first conference and home victory of the season. For the first time since participating in the Yale Invitational on Sept. 4<sup>th</sup>-5<sup>th</sup>, the Gauchos have won back-to-back matches and are now on a two-match winning streak. Santa Barbara’s latest wins improves its overall record to 6-12 and 2-5 in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“This weekend is big for our team and momentum moving forward,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch stated. “We we’re flat to start both matches, but I love the way we came back in the last three sets. “The realization is that we can beat anybody in this conference when we really work for it and execute.”</p>\n<p>The defeat hands Cal State Fullerton its 18<sup>th</sup> loss of the season, and extends the Titans’ losing streak to 21 matches in continuation of last year’s winning slump. Fullerton remains winless at 0-18 and its 0-6 conference record makes the Titans the only Big West team without a conference win. UC Riverside is now 6-14, 1-6 in conference after losing to UCSB on Friday and Cal Poly on Saturday. The Highlanders’ pair of losses extends their losing streak to six matches.</p>\n<p>Having momentum from the previous night’s victory and facing a winless team, it was assumed that Saturday’s match versus Cal State Fullerton would be a lopsided win for UCSB. But the Titans came into the Thunderdome and stunned the Gauchos by taking a 25-20 win in the opening set. It was Fullerton’s first set-victory after being swept in its last three matches.</p>\n<p>Both teams traded points throughout the initial set, not allowing each other to gain a lead bigger than a margin of one. It wasn’t until the two teams were knotted at 18 that Cal State Fullerton managed to break away. A kill by senior setter Mackenzie Olsen set the tone for the Titans’ 7-2 run. Closing out Fullerton’s victory was freshman outside hitter Kyra Smith, who led the team with 11 kills.</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, UCSB had a total of three players with double digit kills in one match. Leading the Gauchos’ stellar offensive attack was senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva. She recorded a match-high 15 kills to go along with a .306 hitting clip and 10 digs.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for this time,” Villanueva said. “I’ve been waiting for a win. All of us worked really hard to get each other fired up to pull off these two wins this weekend.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s attack was at its best in the second set. The Gauchos hit for a match-high .433 hitting percentage and went on an 8-1 run to secure a 25-12 victory that tied the match at 1-1. Backing Villanueva’s performance was the tremendous play of senior opposite Britton Taylor and Grunt. The two Gauchos registered 13 kills and helped UCSB obtain its .302 hitting average for the night.</p>\n<p>Similar to the match’s opening, it was a battle for the lead in a pivotal third set. But the Gauchos’ rhythm on offense continued as they went on an 8-2 run to snag the 2-1 lead, winning by a score of 25-19.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton had no chance against UCSB in the final set. Villanueva tallied five straight kills to open the fourth set which paved the way for the Gauchos’ 25-10 rout of the Titans and their 3-1 match victory.</p>\n<p>“After last night, it gave us a confidence booster,” Taylor said. “Tonight we came in with the same mindset and belief in each other which really helped us pull through and get the win.”</p>\n<p>Providing Santa Barbra with that confidence boost was Friday’s win over UC Riverside. Despite trailing after losing the first set 15-25, the Gauchos persevered to win the match’s final three sets in scores of 25-20, 25-19, and 25-18.</p>\n<p>Besides UCSB’s equalizing victory in the second set in which it earned a .275 hitting clip, it was a poor hitting match for both teams. Santa Barbara clocked a .152 hitting percentage, while Riverside finished with a .065 attacking average. Despite UCR’s struggles offensively, senior outside hitter Helena Peric ended the evening with a match-high 14 kills.</p>\n<p>Helping guide UCSB to victory was Grunt, who had a team-high 13 kills and a match-high .500 hitting clip. She certainly put her bid in as a Big West Player of the Week nominee after a weekend in which she finished with a total of 26 kills, nine blocks, and a .489 hitting average.</p>\n<p>“The great thing about Phoebe was she was on from the first moment,” Lantagne Welch said. “Whereas our team was really flat in set one, she came to play with energy and fire. She was going to find a way to put the ball to the floor.”</p>\n<p>While No. 8 Hawai’i and Long Beach State are destined to finish within the top two spots of the Big West, UCSB’s opportunity to prove itself as deserving of the conference’s pick to finish third is still possible with nine matches left.</p>\n<p>Next for Santa Barbara are road matches against Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-earn-first-conference-win-end-11-match-losing-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-earn-first-conference-win-end-11-match-losing-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-earn-first-conference-win-end-11-match-losing-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-earn-first-conference-win-end-11-match-losing-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-earn-first-conference-win-end-11-match-losing-streak/","id":5079,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5078,5077,5076],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Still Chasing First Conference Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsLongBeach-20151003-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Despite great performances in the first set of its last two matches, the UCSB women's volleyball team has yet to end its nine-game losing streak.

The Gauchos head up North to take on UC Davis tonight and will continue their excursion on the road to face rival Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“It is a short week, however, we still had our normal day off,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We’re going to have a couple weeks where we play on Thursday, so I think it’s just something that is a part of Division I athletics. You just have to deal with it and make the best of it.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies welcome UCSB with a 7-11 record, and despite going 0-2 in its conference opening weekend, UC Davis is now 2-2 in Big West play after consecutive 3-1 victories over UC Riverside and UC Irvine this past week.<br>\nDavis certainly has the upper hand heading into tonight’s matchup as the Aggies defeated UCSB in both of last season’s meetings, sweeping the Gauchos in the first contest and stealing a five-set victory the second time around.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Simply having her way against Santa Barbara last year was outside hitter Kaylin Squyres. Now a senior, Squyres tallied a total of 38 kills and 20 digs in the two matches played, in which 24 of her kills occurred in the team’s second victory. After leading the Big West in kills (441) and kills per set (4.12) last season, there’s no indication that Squyress’ dominance on the court will be ending any time soon as she is on pace to be crowned the statistical leader in both categories for consecutive seasons.</p>\n<p>Squyress currently leads the Big West in kills (317), kills per set (4.73), and ranks third in total digs (241). She was named the Big West Player of the Week after back-to-back 20-plus kill performances (24 vs. UCR, 25 vs. UCI) in Davis’ last two conference meetings. Notably, Squyres became just the ninth player in Aggie history to surpass 1,000 career kills as she now has 1,023.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got a go-to player in Squyres,” Lantagne Welch said. “You’re certainly not going to shut her down, but we have to at least slow her down. The best way to counterattack a good hitter is to put the ball away when you have your opportunity.”</p>\n<p>While Squyres has been the focal point of the Aggies’ success, the entire Davis team has played incredibly well. It leads the Big West in total kills (882), assists (833), service aces (93) and digs (1,022). Also, along with Squyres’ conference honor, freshman libero Malia Bolko received her first career Big West Defensive Player of the Week award after amassing a total of 42 kills and an average of 5.25 digs per set in Davis’ Thursday and Saturday wins.</p>\n<p>Despite its shortcomings against UC Davis, the results of last season’s classic “Blue/Green” rivalry matches were to the advantage of the Gauchos. UCSB opened its 2014 conference schedule against the Mustangs, winning a rigorous five-set match and finished its season in San Luis Obispo with a 3-1 victory over Cal Poly. Santa Barbara’s last loss to Cal Poly was on Oct. 12, 2011.</p>\n<p>However, the 9-17, 4-12 team that existed last season has renovated its program and is currently peaking, making a statement as the Big West season unfolds. It has nearly been 10 years since the Mustangs last ended a season as conference champions. They conquered the Big West in the years 2006 and 2007, earning back-to-back conference champion honors.</p>\n<p>Fresh off a weekend in which it upset Long Beach State and swept Cal State Northridge, the Cal Poly Mustangs arguably are the Big West’s most improved team this season, harboring a 10-4, 2-1 conference record.<br>\nLeading the Mustangs’ winning crusade is freshman outside hitter Adlee Van Winden. A definite candidate for the Big West Freshman of the Year award, Van Winden steered the Mustangs to their upset over Long Beach State which knocked the 49ers out of the AVCA Top 25 rankings. She produced a career-high 21 kills, helping Cal Poly end LBSU’s 23-match conference streak. Following Friday’s triumph, she registered 12 kills in the Mustangs sweep of CSUN.</p>\n<p>Van Winden’s phenomenal performance earned the first-year player her fourth Big West Freshman of the Week honor. While class standing places her within the Class of 2019, her performance on the court makes her seem like a veteran. Van Winden ranks fourth in the Big West in kills (205) and third in kills per set (3.94). It is evident that she has put much time into her attacking technique as she has notched double-digit kills in 13 of the team’s 14 matches this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s winless streak has yet to come to an end, but the Gauchos have made progressive strides over the course of their three conference games. Santa Barbara won the first set in both of its last two matches, but must learn how to maintain its lead throughout the game’s duration.</p>\n<p>“Our energy level is huge for that,” Coach Lantagne Welch said. “The previous week we had talked about starting slow so we made the change and got good starts. Now we just need to maintain it and restart at each set of every match.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match between UCSB and UC Davis will begin at 7:00 p.m. at The Pavilion and will have a day off before facing Cal Poly on Saturday at 7:00 p.m. at the Robert A. Mott’s Athletic Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65119\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/65119/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65119\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/65119/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/65119/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/65119/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/65119/","id":5080,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5079,5078,5077],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
