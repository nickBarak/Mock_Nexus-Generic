Her story inspired him enough to catch a train and knock on her door, initiating an eight-year mission to earn her trust and acquire the rights to her book to adapt it into a motion picture. For those eight years, he crafted a screenplay that became the film “The Theory of Everything”.</p>\n<p>“The Theory of Everything” traces the lives of the Hawkings from their first meeting at Cambridge University through the 1980s. Shortly after they met in 1963 and after only a few dates, Stephen was diagnosed with ALS and given two years to live. Despite the tragic news, Jane decided to continue seeing him and dedicated herself to helping him fight the disease. They were engaged in 1964, and she stuck by him as the disease progressed, eventually causing him to lose his abilities to walk, talk and take care of himself.</p>\n<p>Stephen Hawking is famous for overcoming the limitations of his disease and making advances in the field of theoretical physics and cosmology. However, “The Theory of Everything” focuses on the behind-the-scenes aspects of Hawking’s life and the impact Jane had on it. She really was the unspoken hero, who gave up her studies in order to help him live, something he was not capable of doing on his own. Her efforts allowed him to focus on physics and make the accomplishments that made him the legend he is today.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones portray Stephen and Jane, and they do not disappoint. Their performances are exceptional. Redmayne’s portrayal is particularly impressive because of his lack of dialogue in the film. He depicted the slow deterioration of Stephen’s speech, which culminated in complete loss after a life-threatening surgery. Redmayne used facial expressions to convey much of Stephen’s emotions while illustrating the different stages of the disease, a difficult feat when one keeps in mind that scenes are not filmed in chronological order. Jones, on the other hand, excellently portrayed Jane’s struggle to balance taking care of her husband, raising their children and dealing with their financial problems.</p>\n<p>Although it wouldn’t really be a spoiler since the film is not fictional, I won’t reveal how the film and the Hawkings’ marriage pans out. But I will say that the final act gave me a new perspective on Stephen Hawking. I can say for certain that he would not have been able to do what he’s achieved or make the impacts he’s made if it was not for Jane Hawking. She gave up her dreams for love, dedicating her life to a man she had just met. She saw something in him that was powerful enough for her to make such a life-changing decision, and she was strong enough to devote herself to him. What she did is a great achievement in itself, and one that not very many people would be capable of. It had a larger impact on the world than she probably ever imagined.</p>\n<p>When I first walked into the screening at Pollock Theater, I felt the fear that I always get when seeing a biographical film, the fear that it wouldn’t effectively convey the intricacies of the subject’s life. These films boil down the long and complex journey of a person’s entire existence to two hours. Think of all the inherent problems and difficulties that could come with that. However, “The Theory of Everything” does not claim to delineate Hawking’s entire life, focusing instead on one particular aspect of it. And it portrayed that surprisingly well.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t the only one that didn’t house many complaints. In the Q&amp;A that followed the screening, Anthony McCarten told the story of when they screened the movie for Stephen Hawking himself. He was brought to tears, and after providing the gift of his unique computer voice to the producers, the only complaint he had was why it ended only halfway through his life.</p>\n<p><em>“The Theory of Everything” opens at the Camino Real Marketplace Theater on Nov. 21.

And lastly, Nizhoni, Navajo by descent and Christian by adoption, attempts to uncover her “true” identity before leaving for college, despite the efforts of her adoptive parents.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The event which brought these characters together was SickBoy’s younger sister’s <em>kinaalda</em>, a Navajo maturity ceremony, held at the home of Felixia’s traditional Navajo grandparents who happen to also be Nizhoni’s biological grandparents. The best standout quality of this film is the less-than-ideal fate its main characters are forced to accept in the end. It does away with the happy ending fantasy so prominent in mainstream films in favor of harsher realities. SickBoy gets arrested and becomes ineligible to join the army, Felixia leaves the small town to find acceptance in New York and Nizhoni goes off to college having only seen a small glimpse of her birth family and culture.</p>\n<p>The screening offered an excellent opportunity for patrons to discover and learn about the OUTrageous! film festival. Since 1992, the Santa Barbara Lesbian &amp; Gay Film Festival has been showcasing a wide variety of films and videos that “entertain, challenge, and educate” the LGBTQ community and LGBTQ-friendly community. The Gay and Lesbian Business Association (GLBA) were also present at the event. The GLBA is another organization in Santa Barbara that works to “strengthen the economic influence and cultural vitality of the local gay and lesbian community.” This includes putting on events and offering scholarships to promote positive gay and lesbian contributions to the community. They were seen outside of the theater handing out raffle tickets to all the students present, and after the film they chose 15 at random to accept $100 scholarships.</p>\n<p>Expecting little more than maybe an entertaining film, the reality of a warm, friendly and philanthropic community get-together was a pleasant surprise. The film left event-goers with a feeling of realistic fulfillment, the kind that comes from having gained greater insight and understanding of the plights of others, rather than the all-too-common, real-life fairytale that leaves you grappling for any meaning. It felt more like a movie and hangout with a large group of friends than a quick movie screening where you’re in and out before the credits stop rolling.</p>\n<p><em>Tickets and passes to the events as well as volunteer opportunities are available at </em>outrageousfilmfestival.org.<em> Check out </em>glbasb.org<em> to get involved or sign up for student scholarships.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58292\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/a-night-out-at-the-outrageous-film-festival/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58292\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/a-night-out-at-the-outrageous-film-festival/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/a-night-out-at-the-outrageous-film-festival/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/a-night-out-at-the-outrageous-film-festival/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-14/a-night-out-at-the-outrageous-film-festival/","id":6026,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[6025,6024,6023],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“House of Cards” Editor Comes to Campus: He Calls the Shots","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Behind every great TV show stands a great producer.

Just like how power-hungry politician Underwood calls the shots in Congress, Smith literally calls the shots in the show. He transforms raw footage into shot sequences that become episodes. Smith’s road to power may not have been “paved with hypocrisy and casualties” like Underwood’s, but he wields his power effectively.</p>\n<p>“This is the show in which I’ve taken the most pride in my career. I feel like we’re reinventing episodic. We don’t call it television anymore. We’re in a whole new world in terms of how people are absorbing entertainment,” Smith said. He explained that “episodic” refers more to storytelling, which can happen anywhere.</p>\n<p>Just as the platforms for digital entertainment change, so do the filming methods.</p>\n<p>“The lines between features and television are blurred now. Another thing is ‘cross boarding’ — shooting two episodes at a time. I’m usually paired with the director so I’m cutting two episodes simultaneously,” Smith said. “They shoot for 20 days now — 10 days per episode. Instead of cutting 50 pages or so, I’m cutting 120 pages of script in 20 days. Then I have a couple days to add in music and play around with sound.”</p>\n<p>Smith brought the audience into his innovative editing hub, showing the filmmaking systems he uses on his laptop. Right above his “Call of Duty: Legacy” folder was his “House of Cards” folder. He hailed PIX as the best system for scene-editing, citing only one problem: “I wish programs would work as fast as my brain thinks — in my head [the scenes] are already done.”</p>\n<p>Smith walked the audience through the making of the second season’s chilling first episode from an editor’s point of view. He demonstrated how to highlight a shot or scene and communicate with the directors and producers about edits. It seemed similar to using Google Docs or “track changes” on Word.</p>\n<p>One of the television phenomena that defines “House of Cards” is the on-screen text messages; Underwood’s words appear much more vicious in 30 succinct characters. Smith detailed how he suggested that a scene in the script become an on-screen text instead, and the directors and producers responded enthusiastically. “This is a powerful example of how collaboration can be. This is how I go to work every day.”</p>\n<p>Smith inspires people to look beyond the typical director-producer leadership duo of television. “Power is a lot like real estate. It’s all about location, location, location. The closer you are to the source, the higher your property value,” Underwood said while standing next to the President.

Theater on Friday Nov. 7 about his experiences in television. After showing offbeat, nostalgia-invoking clips from his extensive career, he gave valuable advice for young people interested in breaking into the industry and shared his important eight rules to live by. Dressed in all black and poised with relaxed professionalism, Kriegman introduced these rules by saying that he pinned them up on his door when his writers were stressed or freaking out. Whether it is writer’s block or a lack of motivation or confidence, these rules are applicable and essential to any creative person.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 1: Don’t worry, and if you do don’t tell anybody.</p>\n<p>While working on different TV shows, Kriegman experienced many setbacks, from starting an idea over again to getting bad ratings. What he learned was that fear spreads. If one person is worried, it has a domino effect and starts to affect everybody. Worrying doesn’t do any good anyway. “Act like you know what you’re doing. Fake it until you make it,” he advised.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Rule No. 2: Inspiration is overrated.</p>\n<p>Most people start projects only when they feel motivated and inspired, but Kriegman has another idea. “Don’t depend on inspiration. It’s unreliable. Inspiration comes and goes. It makes you feel good but it’s not always going to be there,” he said. “You don’t have to be inspired to start. Just start.” Shedding a new light on the predefined idea of inspiration, Kriegman preached that we don’t need to have it in order to create a great piece of work. If you wait forever for that perfect idea, it may never come.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 3: Wrap yourself in the cloak of creativity.</p>\n<p>Mixing a Harry Potter reference with real life counsel, the writer said, “I think creative people are really invulnerable, they just have to create. Rejection is not a problem.”</p>\n<p>He acknowledged the fact that rejection is actually a problem for many people, especially the difficulty in getting noticed and published. “Don’t be worried about submitting places and getting turned down,” Kriegman said. “It’s better to not care and just try. Try to find a place for your work — it doesn’t make you less of a writer if you get turned down.”</p>\n<p>Kriegman explained that there are two types of creativity: exhaustive and overflowing. Exhaustive creativity is the kind where someone creates just to get it out of his or her system and be done. Overflowing is creative that is never ending, and constantly leads to something new. The latter is geared toward success. “Rejection isn’t an issue. There are so many places for your work, you just need to find the right place.”</p>\n<p>Rule No. 4: There are no bad ideas.</p>\n<p>Any idea, especially one that you care about, is never a bad one. If they seem bad, remember that they are good ideas that just don’t have a place yet. Kriegman explained, “Ideas are like keys, you just need to find a door to open. Just because someone doesn’t see it yet, doesn’t mean it’s not good.” He used a personal example of how his novel, <em>Being Audrey Hepburn</em> was supposed to be a TV show or a screenplay, but found its “place” as a novel after he worked on it for twenty years.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 5: Don’t do it great, just make it a little bit better.</p>\n<p>Some are afraid that their ideas will not be good enough. The advice that Kriegman gives his students is, “Don’t do it great, just make it a little bit better.” According to the writer, lessening the pressure on projects eases the creation process. With constant tweaking, re-writing and working, ideas become something substantial. Citing the classic example of Michaelangelo slowly getting rid of stuff that’s not David, Kriegman showed that work is all about getting rid of bad versions to get to the good versions. But if you’re afraid to take the first step, it may never happen. If it’s not right in the beginning, it will get better.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 6: A lot can happen in a day.</p>\n<p>Instead of thinking about how much to get done in a day, focus on the process. Once you focus on it and not the concern, you will become more productive.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 7: Define your own victories.</p>\n<p>Live in a world that gives you credit. Kriegman gives himself credit for starting projects. As a man who always tries to do more, he said, “Solidly starting is as good as writing five pages in a day because it takes a lot of energy. When you define success, you have your own sense of what is success.”</p>\n<p>He described writer’s block as “having a better idea of something in your head that you’re able to write.” However, many people get hung up on even trying because they never get close to that so-called idea. The only way to be satisfied is to redefine it, and know that the product will never match up to the idea completely.</p>\n<p>Rule No. 8: Where you’re standing now is not where you’re going to be.</p>\n<p>There is always going to be something new. “Whatever you think you’re dealing with now, there’s going to be something else. You think you’ve rewritten a chapter, but then you’re exposed to new things to work on,” Kriegman said.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to always feel like something is not right, but the world is in a constant state of upheaval. The same problems and opportunities will never stay the same. So take it from Mitchell Kriegman, and remember not to dwell.</p>\n<p>For more information on Mitchell Kriegman, go to <em>beingaudreyhepburn.com</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58123\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/mitchell-kriegman-explains-it-all-eight-rules-for-a-creative-person-to-live-by/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58123\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/mitchell-kriegman-explains-it-all-eight-rules-for-a-creative-person-to-live-by/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/mitchell-kriegman-explains-it-all-eight-rules-for-a-creative-person-to-live-by/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/mitchell-kriegman-explains-it-all-eight-rules-for-a-creative-person-to-live-by/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/mitchell-kriegman-explains-it-all-eight-rules-for-a-creative-person-to-live-by/","id":6028,"author":{"id":746,"name":"Erika Lee"},"related":[6027,6026,6025],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
