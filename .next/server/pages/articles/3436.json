According to statistics gathered by <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZiVslx1Zpce-fvuGn8yvnFz-mH8C2ARHqoMWC8rNPs4/edit?usp=sharing\">a <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey</a> randomly sampling 376 students, 40.7 percent of students have tried some psychoactive prescription drug at least once in their life and 35 percent have tried Adderall at least once, with 25.4 percent noting that they did it specifically for school and only 1.1 percent stating that they used it specifically for ADHD.</p>\n<p>The survey has also found that some students take amphetamine stimulants such as Vyvanse, Dexedrine and Dextrostat as well as benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Klonopin and Ativan to study, for recreation, to treat medical conditions or for other purposes.</p>\n<p>According to Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta, the statistics “sound accurate,” as many students who come to Student Health seek consultation and treatment for ADHD or attention deficit disorder (ADD) either because of concerns about their condition or because they feel medication “can help them study, help them concentrate, can help them prepare for tests.”</p>\n<p>“The percentage of students who say that they have tried it are probably not using the medications as prescribed … but reporting their uses more as experimentation or [to] improve their study habits or study skills,” Kurta said, “particularly for Adderall.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, according to the <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey, 87.7 percent of students who have used Adderall do not have a prescription.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Between the immediate gratification of a text and computer access and the Internet’s speed [and] the need to be multitasking these options all day long … we tend to distract ourselves quite a lot and don’t give ourselves the opportunity to focus as much. — Jackie Kurta</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kurta said she is concerned about assumptions that many students make about the projected risk of prescription drug abuse, claiming that students wrongly assume that because prescription drug use is widespread, it is safe.</p>\n<p>“These are very potent medications, and they need to be properly assessed, properly diagnosed, properly dosed and properly managed.” Kurta said. “We certainly don’t want to give people the impression that anybody can take anything and it’ll help them. There are risks.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58015\" style=\"width: 314px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"954950762\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58013\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58015\" data-attachment-id=\"58015\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/drugs-front-photo-page-by-kenneth-song_for-11-06-2014-5918/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=2832%2C4256&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2832,4256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415234785\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5918\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918.jpg?fit=681%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58015\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5918-681x1024.jpg?resize=304%2C457\" alt=\"Lecturer Kendall Hassemer believes the use of these drugs may be due to increased academic pressure and over-stimulation of students’ current surrounding environment.

People tend to think that there’s a reduced risk with Adderall because so many people are prescribed it when really there are risks involved. You don’t know how your body will respond to it.” Peters also said she doubts many Adderall users have prescriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Are So Many Students Doing It?</strong></p>\n<p>Exercise &amp; Sports Studies 2 (ESS2)/Substance Abuse lecturer Kendall Hassemer said students are facing increasing pressure within the education system to “perform perfectly,” which sets students up for cycles of high anxiety, depression and drug-seeking behavior in order to cope with stress. According to her, these problems are symptomatic of the overstimulation students are inundated with in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>“I do believe that this greater focus on ADD/ADHD is due to increased awareness as well as continual nervous system exposure and overstimulation of the current surrounding environment,” Hassemer said in an email. “Research has shown that internet/communications and electronic devices alter neurotransmitter and brain function over time.”</p>\n<p>Kurta agrees and said she thinks prescription drugs are used among students who do not necessarily have behavioral conditions but in actuality need “a quick fix to be able to blast through [studying].”</p>\n<p>“I think it’s kind of a byproduct of the way our society is now operating in terms of our ability to multitask,” Kurta said. “Between the immediate gratification of a text and computer access and the Internet’s speed [and] the need to be multitasking these options all day long, I think we do in ourselves promote this idea that we can’t focus on any one thing when in fact we tend to distract ourselves quite a lot and don’t give ourselves the opportunity to focus as much.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year economics major Michael, with constant increase in pressures from the university to academically succeed and with pressure at internships or jobs to excel, “study drugs become more and more of a thing” as more students feel as though they must compete with one another.</p>\n<p>“The fact that students know [the dangers] and still take them, even relying on these drugs, just shows the types of environments and pressures that are put on all of the students of the U.S. education system,” he said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have friends that didn’t want to try [prescription drugs] but with the pressures of school and the easy access to them, they ended up using them … They are addictive drugs and if you abuse them, they will be detrimental and they’ll be useless in the context of academics. —Quinn</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second-year engineering major Kenneth said that while the use of study drugs may seem to help, it can create a psychological dependence that would not have been previously there.</p>\n<p>“I have heard from friends I’ve talked to that they are great and even if they don’t make you study harder they make the process more enjoyable,” he said. “On the other hand, some have said that they often think if they had never started [taking these drugs] they wouldn’t need it now.”</p>\n<p>However, according to fourth-year political science major Nikolai, the use of prescription drugs such as Adderall is not as detrimental as some claim it to be.</p>\n<p>“I take Adderall on an occasional basis and it has no apparent long-term detrimental side affects. It has certainly saved my ass on more than one occasion in an academic respect,” Nikolai said. “I feel like it won’t be the last time it will.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Quinn said she thinks that the overuse of drugs, at least at UCSB, stems not just from the pressure to succeed, but also from easy access. She said that even though these drugs are legal, “they are still, very much, drugs.”</p>\n<p>“I have friends that didn’t want to try [prescription drugs] but with the pressures of school and the easy access to them, they ended up using them,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58016\" style=\"width: 395px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1471172757\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58013\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58016\" data-attachment-id=\"58016\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/drugs-front-photo-page-by-kenneth-song_for-11-06-2014-5946/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415235563\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5946\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58016\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946-1024x681.jpg?resize=385%2C256\" alt=\"Drugs front photo page by Kenneth Song_for 11.06.2014-5946\" width=\"385\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Drugs-front-photo-page-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.06.2014-5946.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58016\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A <em>Daily Nexus</em> survey found that 34.8 percent of students have used Adderall at least once and that 18.4 percent of students have used Xanax at least once. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Fixing the Symptoms Instead of Solving the Problem<br>\n</strong><br>\nAccording to Kurta, a lot of students that come to the Alcohol &amp; Drug program find themselves turning to not just “study drugs,” but also to anti-anxiety medication such as Xanax in order to feel relief from stress or trauma.</p>\n<p>“They do talk about the fact that some of their use is prompted by a feeling of some relief from stress, relief from anxiety — many from feelings of depression, or loneliness or traumatic situations that have occurred,” Kurta said.</p>\n<p>Peters agreed and said that widespread use of benzodiazepines such as Xanax, Klonopin and Ativan can lead to detrimental and even possibly fatal results.</p>\n<p>“With Xanax, a lot of people think its fine since it’s so widely prescribed for anxiety, not realizing they’re very potent,” Peters said, “especially when accidentally or purposefully mixed with alcohol, it can be deadly.”</p>\n<p>According to Hassemer, our continuously competitive academic environment coupled with college students’ natural inclination to experiment are both elements that factor into student inclination to abuse pharmaceutical drugs.</p>\n<p>“The high-stress environment of a college campus, linked with exposure to prescription drugs, and even natural curiosity of this age group, makes it more likely for experimentation and dangerous, even life-threatening habits to form,” Hassemer said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak … An anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what’s happening. And a lot of these drugs are that. We’re getting our children through education by anaesthetizing them. — Sir Ken Robinson</p></blockquote>\n<p>So let’s say school is the problem. Then what? When all is said and done, is there anything anyone can do to mitigate the prescription drug problem?</p>\n<p>According to notable author, speaker and international advisor in education Sir Ken Robinson in a Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts (RSA) lecture titled “Changing Education Paradigms,” diagnosis of ADHD has risen in parallel with the growth of standardized testing, a phenomenon which he said is no coincidence.</p>\n<p>“Our children are living in the most intensely stimulating period in the history of the earth,” Robinson said in the lecture. “They’re being besieged with information and calls for their attention from every platform — computers, from iPhones, from advertising hoardings, from hundreds of television channels — and we’re penalizing them now for getting distracted. From what? Boring stuff at school, for the most part.”</p>\n<p>Robinson, who points out that the public school system was modeled to meet the needs of industrialism in the 19th century, advocates for a reassessment of our current education model in order to meet 21st century standards. He also points to Ritalin and Adderall as “quite dangerous drugs” given to students to force them to focus in a model of education that is outdated.</p>\n<p>“And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak … An anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what’s happening,” Robinson said. “And a lot of these drugs are that. We’re getting our children through education by anaesthetizing them.”</p>\n<p>According to Robinson, the increased usage of prescription drugs points to a necessity to change the educational paradigm. This means doing away with Industrial Age methods of schooling such as ringing bells, separate facilities specialized into separate subjects and separating school children by age. Instead, Robinson states that we must start looking at ways to encourage creativity and divergent thinking into the school system.</p>\n<p>Whether his advice rings true or not, one thing is for certain — a significant chunk of students are medicating themselves in order to get by, and unless either students or school systems change, prescription drugs are here to stay.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zDZFcDGpL4U\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>This story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, November 6, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexu<em>s. </em><em>Some names in this article have been changed on condition of anonymity.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/getting-into-focus-nexus-explores-study-drug-use-among-students/","id":3436,"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen"},"related":[3435,3434,3433],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen","biography":"Not available","articles":[2684,2726,2734,2821,2866,2886,2958,2973,3436,4681,4794],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UC Fully Divests from Fossil Fuels, Sells $1 Billion in Assets","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2020-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Going forward, the UC Investments team is committed to growing its investments in sustainable practices such as renewable energy, waste conversion, sustainable agriculture and technology.

Both the decision to divest from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy were made under this policy, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe the university and its stakeholders are much better served by investing in promising opportunities in the alternative energy field rather than gambling on oil and gas,” Richard Sherman, chair of the UC Board of Regents’ Investments Committee, said in the press release.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bachher also noted in the press release that the journey to divestment took a significant step when the UC sold off its investments in coal and oil sands one year after the UC Investment Office adopted the ESG policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to concern from investors about the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on fossil fuel stock prices, Bachher said in the press release that the UC’s divestment represents an important turning point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we certainly could not have predicted the speed nor depth of the recent downturn in the traditional energy sector, signs point to a structural shift — not merely another cycle of boom or bust,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bachher also said in the press release that the “lowered demand and oversupply” of fossil fuels “could portend an even longer price drought in oil and gas” as the world recovers from the pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, the UC investments team is committed to growing its investments in sustainable practices such as renewable energy, waste conversion, sustainable agriculture and technology associated with these goals, the press release stated. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the UC Office of the President, the UC has invested $38 million into the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) through donations from the </span><a

own funds in the past six years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The financial report was obtained through a California Public Records Act from the campus activist organization Mauna Kea Protectors at UC Berkeley in early May and details the UC’s history of contributions to TMT from October 2014 to February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But until recently, public knowledge surrounding the UC’s use of its own funds for the roughly </span><a href=\"https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2020/03/17/hawaii-news/thirty-meter-telescope-cost-estimate-increases-to-2-4b/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.4 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> telescope project has been largely speculative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an </span><a href=\"http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/mar14/f4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">action item</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the March 2014 Board of Regents meeting, the UC and Caltech agreed to split a $250 million pledge from GBMF and to jointly raise an additional $100 million from their own funds. The UC said in the action item that it planned to raise its half of the share — $50 million — through “philanthropic support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But funding directly from the UC has come from a variety of other sources, including reallocated funding from another observatory project, the UC’s department of Research and Graduate Studies and “systemwide funds,” which are used “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for an array of purposes including teaching and research,” Stett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the UC, said in an email to the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student fees, however, are not included in the UC’s contributions to TMT, according to UC Spokesperson Claire Doan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC had contributed to TMT solely through grants from GBMF from October 2014 until October 2016, when it made a $10 million contribution to TMT using its own funds, according to the financial report. The $10 million contribution was one of the largest donations listed on the financial report, second to a $13,883,525 contribution made that same month from GBMF grant funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, the UC has continued to make contributions with its own funds in varying amounts — some as small as $126 in September 2017 and others as large as $5 million, which it paid out four separate times in June 2018, November 2018, August 2019 and February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The timing of the UC’s February 2020 contribution to TMT also came less than a month after UC Board of Regents Chair John Pérez said at the Board’s January meeting that he intended to facilitate a discussion about the UC’s involvement with the project, The Daily Californian </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/05/22/uc-invests-68m-into-thirty-meter-telescope-on-maunakea/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the activist organization Uprooted &amp; Rising said at a </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/uprootedandrising/videos/920585268346863/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press conference</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 21 that the UC has not engaged in any discussions surrounding its involvement in the project. Many students spoke at a public forum during the May 21 Board of Regents virtual Zoom meeting, asking the Regents to divest from TMT and echoing the demands of an </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/uc-student-governments-call-for-divestment-of-thirty-meter-telescope-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the UC Student Association in September 2019 calling on the UC to cut financial ties with the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite ongoing friction from UC students who contest TMT’s development on Native Hawaiian land, the UC maintains that it is “deeply committed” to respecting the environment and culture surrounding Mauna Kea and has collaborated with the Hawaiian community “to address a range of cultural, environmental, educational and economic issues,” Holbrook wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jeike Meijer, a fourth-year global studies and feminist studies double major and an organizer for the Mauna Kea Protectors at UC Santa Barbara, “this investment is making a very big statement about [the UC’s] lack of support for Indigenous and Hawaiian students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said many students are frustrated with the UC because they feel that their opposition to TMT has gone ignored and that the UC’s opacity with the project is a disservice to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the UC Board of Regents virtual meeting from May 19-21, Meijer said she and Terrill James Kaneali‘i Williams, an Indigeneous Hawaiian graduate student from UC Riverside, were promised an opportunity to speak during public forum; after speaking first, Meijer said the Board of Regents did not call on Kaneali‘i Williams to speak, even though “they promised two days in a row to call [on] him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so frustrating because there’s no other way for him to get to talk to the board because it’s all virtual now. And it felt like they were silencing him,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That was really frustrating for me because I’m Indigenous, but I’m not Hawaiian. And we were banking on having the Hawaiian voice be there,” she added. “So it’s really challenging with these virtual Board of Regents meetings because they can choose to just not call [on] people and that seems to be what they’ve done.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, students have voiced their concerns regarding TMT in a variety of ways, including a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in December with Native Hawaiian activists, </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-22/students-condemn-uc-and-chancellor-yangs-involvement-in-thirty-meter-telescope-express-support-for-native-hawaiians/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to condemn the university’s involvement and meetings with Chancellor Henry T.
