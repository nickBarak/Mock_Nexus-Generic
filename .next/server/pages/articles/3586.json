Observers correlate this decrease with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President.</p>\n<p>Among more than 250 colleges and universities across the country, more than 40 percent reported at least a 2 percent decrease in international applicants, according to findings released April 5 by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO).</p>\n<p>The UC saw a similar trend in 2004 and 2005 following the U.S.-led multinational invasion of Iraq. In contrast, American students responded to heightened political tensions following President George W. Bush’s declaration of a “war on terror” by showing an increased interest in studying abroad.</p>\n<p>According to Juan Campo, the UCSB Education Abroad Program director, this year’s increase in applicants to EAP programs around the world is related to controversy surrounding the new administration’s policies, mirroring the surge in applicants in the aftermath of 9/11.</p>\n<p>While there are currently no EAP programs in the six countries under Trump’s Middle East travel ban, Jordan is a popular location for students interested in studying in the region because of its central location and reputation as a reasonably stable nation.</p>\n<p>According to Campo, more UCSB students applied to the EAP programs in Jordan than ever before, with an increase from three applicants for the 2016-17 school year to 13 for the 2017-18 school year.</p>\n<p>“Our enrollments are up over last year, and I am not surprised,” Campo said. “[After 9/11] people were saying, ‘Oh, it’s going to go down,’ but no, because it may cause students to want to become more engaged with the world.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what’s happening now … It’s really heartening to see that and looking system-wide they have a higher number of applications at this time than they had last year at this time,” he said.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President has not yet determined if the drop in applicants of 1.2 percent at Berkeley and 2.2 percent at Riverside is linked to the national phenomenon, as official enrollment figures will be released later in April.</p>\n<p>Lisa Przekop, UCSB director of admissions, said it is difficult to determine whether the university’s international applicant numbers will be similarly affected in the coming years. She acknowledged that the current political climate in the U.S. is a legitimate concern for students abroad.</p>\n<p>“It’s important that we continue to communicate honestly with prospective students so we can address their concerns honestly, dispel inaccurate rumors, and show them that UCSB is a friendly community with esteemed faculty and talented students,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Przekop said the close proximity of the application deadline to the presidential election likely influenced students’ decision whether or not to apply to the UC.</p>\n<p>“There was election coverage that didn’t always show the U.S. as being welcoming to international guests,” Przekop said in an email. “Students abroad pay very close attention to what is happening politically in the U.S. and I’m certain that this played at least a small role in UC application numbers from international students.”</p>\n<p>Mahdi Golkaram, an Iranian mechanical engineering Ph.D. student at UCSB, said his peers in Iran have certainly been discouraged from studying in the U.S. since the implementation of the travel ban.</p>\n<p>According to Golkaram, the increasingly challenging process of obtaining a student visa, not the political tensions arising in the early months of the Trump administration, is the major deterrent for students debating whether to study in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day if they need to get the admission letter, clearance, background check, it takes a long time. I have a lot of friends they just gave up and they went to Canada,” Golkaram said.<br>\n“Right now, I have been talking to a lot of friends, and they don’t even think about applying to the United States anymore because they know how hard it will be for them to go through this whole process,” he said.</p>\n<p>Golkaram added that single-entry visas typically administered to international students make travel outside the U.S. nearly impossible, and he hasn’t left the U.S. for three years because he fears he may not secure a visa again.</p>\n<p>“I would rather not leave the United States at all, which means I’m not going to see my country again for a long time,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Golkaram, the inability to travel outside of the U.S. proves especially challenging for graduate students, who are often expected to attend conferences abroad.</p>\n<p>Simran Singh, director of the Office of International Student Services, said while the current political climate is likely a concern for international students, as well as for their parents, the more common barrier is posed by the complications in obtaining a visa.</p>\n<p>Though the recent five percent increase in UC tuition for non-California residents brought the total cost to $41,964, Singh said she believes the tuition hike is not a likely contributing factor to the decrease in international applicants.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the socioeconomic background of the students who are coming here, they really come from wealthy families and I don’t think that’s a deterrent per se,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>While UCSB has yet to see a decrease in international applicants, Singh said, it is important for all departments on campus to make them feel safe and promote a reputation that the UC is equipped with the proper infrastructure to support traveling scholars.</p>\n<p>“We are talked about as a world class research institution and what they really bring is the diversity,” Singh said. “These students bring so much of themselves when they come into our countries and into our institutions. We learn from them as much as they learn from us.”</p>\n<p>Campo said the nationwide decrease in international applicants is very understandable “given the chaos” surrounding the implementation of the travel ban and the university should be taking concrete steps to ensure international students are not “affected adversely” by policies emerging from the Trump White House.</p>\n<p>“The university has to affirm its place, not as a safe zone so much, but as a forum for bringing these issues to the surface and taking a clear stand on how a civil society remains open and tolerant to different points and perspectives to prevent people from being victims of racial violence or xenophobic or religious bias,” Campo said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76693\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucs-see-drop-in-international-applicants/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76693\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucs-see-drop-in-international-applicants/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucs-see-drop-in-international-applicants/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucs-see-drop-in-international-applicants/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucs-see-drop-in-international-applicants/","id":3586,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[3585,3584,3583],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro","biography":"Not available","articles":[2382,2386,2475,2567,2730,2735,2797,2823,2909,2948,2981,2990,3586,3605,3870,3895,3915,4407,4654,4682,4799],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Circuit of Appeals Upholds Injunction in DACA Case","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2018-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Napolitano_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Napolitano_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The 99-page decision supports an earlier court decision from January.

Now that the appellate court has definitively rejected this argument, the university calls on the administration to stop its efforts to rescind the program.”</p>\n<p>Under the Trump Administration, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke initially motioned to eliminate the DACA program in September 2017.</p>\n<p>Duke argued the program was “illegal from its inception” under the Obama Administration.</p>\n<p>UC <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-08/breaking-uc-files-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-for-unlawful-daca-repeal/\">filed a lawsuit</a> challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to repeal the program shortly after.</p>\n<p>The DACA program allows undocumented residents who were brought into the U.S. as children to apply for “two-year renewable periods” allowing them to stay in the U.S.</p>\n<p>In order to be eligible to apply, individuals must have clean criminal records and meet “various educational or military service requirements,” court documents state.</p>\n<p>In wake of Thursday’s decision, UC urged all eligible DACA recipients to renew their grants.</p>\n<p>“While today’s ruling is welcome news, we stress that DACA recipients deserve better than to see their life prospects rise and fall based on events in litigation.

a drop in the ocean, rather,” said Theo LeQuesne, a UC Santa Barbara graduate student and Fossil Free UCSB coordinator.</p>\n<p>The Regents’ investments office has pulled funds from two companies — Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics — both of which are involved in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).</p>\n<p>Students at UCSB and across the UC system have held protests against DAPL’s construction in the months preceding March, calling for the University to divest from companies that support or plan to aid in the construction.</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said March’s announcement to reduce investments from such companies is a step in the right direction, but that it is “clearly not enough” because the UC “needs to be divesting funds more boldly.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a victory that has shown that what we are doing is working, but it also means we need to keep the pressure up,” he said. “We need to keep pushing further for our full goal, which is full divestment.”</p>\n<p>UC Regents Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Singh Bachher said repeatedly at the March 14 meeting of the Regents’ Investments Subcommittee, however, that the decision was based on investment risk and not public pressure on the topic, despite saying he had received 30 to 40 calls asking for divestment the day before the meeting.</p>\n<p>“We do not divest in our office. We will not make a statement trying to grab a headline irrespective of the pressure on the topic,” Bachher said at the subcommittee meeting.</p>\n<p>According to Bachher, the Regents’ investments office has been generally pulling investments from companies which have “higher sustainable investment risks.” He said his office decided to remove from its portfolio certain investments in fossil fuel companies because of “social, sort of more of the headline risks, sustainability-type risks attached to those names.”</p>\n<p>The UC has owned as much as $50 million in bonds with Energy Transfer Partners, an investment Bachher said his office has been gradually selling over time. The University now has $19 or $20 million invested in the fossil fuel company, which Bachher said he “clearly foresee[s] us moving out of in the near future.”</p>\n<p>The UC Regents divested approximately $200 million from coal and oil-sands companies in September 2014. Bachher said to the Regents in March that this was also a move to invest more sustainably.</p>\n<p>“In hindsight, it was probably a good move back then. And we’ve continued that process to what I would call where we have higher sustainable investment risk in particularly oil and gas exploration and production energy-type assets,” Bachher said. “We’ve continued to de-risk the portfolio as we’ve re-underwritten everything we own.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said he sees little to no difference between “de-risking” and divestment.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They are eager to call this process de-risking rather than divesting, but I think it’s important that we push back on that and say de-risking and divesting, all those mean the same,” he said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

students can now request an extension from the initial Nov. 30 deadline to Dec. 15.</p>\n<p>UC will also grant fee waivers to affected students, UC Office of the President (UCOP) said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“We know this is a tremendously difficult time for prospective students and their families who have been impacted by the devastating wildfires,” UC President Janet Napolitano said.</p>\n<p>“This is one small way the university can offer support.”</p>\n<p>Applicants who need an extension must email <em>ucinfo@applyucsupport.n</em><em>et</em> with the same email address used in their UC application.</p>\n<p>The subject headline of the email should be “Extension Request – Weather/Fire Event.” In the email, applicants should use the same first and last name listed in the UC application and include the specific reason for the extension request.</p>\n<p>Email confirmation should arrive within five to seven business days, said UCOP.</p>\n<p>Additionally, affected applicants should list long-term or short-term impacts of the fire in the additional comments section of the UC application Personal Insight portion. Impacts can be – but are not limited to – a mid-year school change or the inability to complete specified courses.</p>\n<p>Further information on the UC application process for those affected by the fires can be viewed <a href=\"http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/files/natural-disasters-extension-2018.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>There are currently several major wildfires burning across California, including the Camp Fire in Butte County and the Woolsey Fire in Ventura County.</p>\n<p>A full map of all wildfires currently burning in California can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1HacmM5E2ueL-FT2c6QMVzoAmE5M19GAf&amp;hl=en\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Map courtesy of CAL FIRE</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
