With their first MPSF victory, the Gauchos seem determined to give the Bruins all they can handle.</p>\n<p>“They’re the number one team in the nation right now,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “It would be a huge step for us. We’re definitely ready to play them harder and closer than we did a few weeks ago when we went down there. We’re going to have to be at our best to beat them, no doubt about it.”</p>\n<p>Falling earlier in the season at UCLA in straight sets, the Gauchos will try to improve their level of competitiveness against the Bruins. The Bruins, however, are winners of nine straight contests and have the top record in both the nation and the conference at 11-1 (6-0 conference), the lone unbeaten team in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>“We have to make the other team earn every point, we can’t give them free points,” McLaughlin said. “At Pepperdine, we did that better than we’ve done it the whole year. We have to do it even better against UCLA. They’re the best team in the country, and you can’t let the best team earn free points if you want to beat them.”</p>\n<p>UCLA defeated rival USC in straight sets last Friday, but only after struggling to put away Pepperdine with a 3-2 victory two days before. The Bruins are currently in the midst of a six-game road trip, the match against Santa Barbara being the third.</p>\n<p>“We feel like we can beat UCLA,” Evans said. “The match against Pepperdine showed that we can play good as a team, and each player can play at their highest performance.”</p>\n<p>Providing a spark for the Gauchos against Pepperdine were a pair of outside hitters in junior Miles Evans and freshman Kevin Donohue. While Evans has led UCSB in kills in seven of nine matches thus far in the season, Donohue is a new weapon for the Gauchos, registering a team-high 17 kills against the Waves.</p>\n<p>“UCLA jumped up in the rankings and now they’ve got a target on their back,” Donohue said. “Coming off our first win of the season against Pepperdine, our guys are really pumped up to play UCLA. We’re looking forward to the match [tonight], especially being at home, so hopefully we can get a good crowd out there.”</p>\n<p>Hoping to capitalize on their opportunities in a similar fashion as they did against Pepperdine, the Gauchos will once again need to limit their errors and use a stout blocking defense at the net to slow down UCLA. The Bruins, meanwhile, lead the conference in blocks per game, hitting percentage, and opponent’s hitting percentage on the season.</p>\n<p>“As a team we need to make sure that we keep the pressure on UCLA,” Donohue said. “One thing that we did against Pepperdine was we blocked really well, we had 15.5 team blocks. That was a major reason why we stepped up and won that game. “</p>\n<p>Junior middle blocker Dylan Davis led the Gauchos with seven kills to go along with seven blocks in Friday’s victory, and will need to be just as dominant if the Gauchos are going to pull off the upset over UCLA.</p>\n<p>The Bruins feature the top two hitters in terms of hitting percentage in the conference in senior quick hitters Thomas Amberg and Weston Dunlap. Dunlap and Amberg lead a veteran Bruins squad featuring seven seniors, compared to the lone senior outside hitter Blaine Nielsen for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Today’s match against UCLA is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44525\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/14-gauchos-return-home-face-topranked-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44525\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/14-gauchos-return-home-face-topranked-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/14-gauchos-return-home-face-topranked-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/14-gauchos-return-home-face-topranked-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-10/14-gauchos-return-home-face-topranked-ucla/","id":5423,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5422,5421,5420],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Fall in Straight Sets at USC","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the road for the second match of a three game road trip, the No. 15 UCSB men’s volleyball team lost to MPSF foe USC in straight sets last night, failing once again to capture their first conferen...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On the road for the second match of a three game road trip, the No. 15 UCSB men’s volleyball team lost to MPSF foe USC in straight sets last night, failing once again to capture their first conference victory of the season.</p>\n<p>Falling in the first two sets, the Gauchos narrowly dropped a tightly contested third set to end the night with their fourth consecutive loss, the third in a row coming against a top 10 team.</p>\n<p>“[USC] didn’t make as many errors as we did,” senior outside hitter Blaine Nielsen said. “When things get tight, we start making some errors.

After dropping their previous three contests, the No. 4 Trojans won their second in a row to improve to 5-3 (4-3 MPSF).</p>\n<p>Southern California captured the first set with relative ease, dispatching the Gauchos with a 25-16 victory behind four kills apiece from senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli and sophomore opposite Tanner Jansen.</p>\n<p>Junior setter Oliver Deutschman led UCSB in the first set with 10 assists and three digs. The Gauchos recorded 10 kills, but also committed 10 of their 25 errors in the set. The Trojans, meanwhile, limited their mistake with only seven errors the entire match.</p>\n<p>“We need to definitely cut down on the mistakes that we make,” Nielsen said. “It’s not that they beat us, we’re kind of beating ourselves.”</p>\n<p>The second set proved similar to the first, as USC outmatched the Gauchos 25-14 to take a 2-0 lead. Freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers recorded four of his team-high 10 blocks in set for the Trojans, while Ciarelli contributed three kills and blocks apiece.</p>\n<p>Down 2-0 to USC, the Gauchos came out in the third set matching the Trojans blow for blow before falling 25-21. While UCSB failed to win the set, they certainly gave the Trojans a scare, forcing them to take a timeout after the Gauchos scored three straight points to bring the game to a 21-20 USC lead.</p>\n<p>Nielsen, who was second on the team with five kills, felt the team played more efficiently in the third and final set.</p>\n<p>“We limited some of the mistakes we made in the first two [sets],” Nielsen said. “This team can compete; we just need to prove it in the game.”</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Miles Evans contributed five of his team leading 10 kills in the third set for the Gauchos. Evans, who also led the team with eight digs, has led UCSB in kills in six of the team’s seven matches.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ third set run was fueled by their bench play, particularly in sophomore setter Bryce Miller and freshman opposite Chris Hartig. Miller recorded 11 of his team-high 16 assists in the set, while Hartig recorded four kills, a block and a service ace.</p>\n<p>“It’s great, this whole team can play volleyball, it’s good to see the other guys in there,” Nielsen said. “We need them; it’s going to take this whole team to turn this season around for us.”</p>\n<p>Ciarelli and Jansen led the Trojans in kills against the Gauchos with 11 and 10 apiece, respectively, while each recorded five blocks. As a unit, Southern California managed 27 blocks in the game, compared to a mere two for a Santa Barbara squad that did not record its first until the third set.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its road trip with a 7 p.m. match at Pepperdine Friday night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44207\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/gauchos-fall-straight-sets-usc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44207\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/gauchos-fall-straight-sets-usc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/gauchos-fall-straight-sets-usc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/gauchos-fall-straight-sets-usc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/gauchos-fall-straight-sets-usc/","id":5420,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5419,5418,5417],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Nab First MPSF Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Weeks of hard work in practice finally paid off for the No. 15 UCSB men’s volleyball team, as they captured their first MPSF victory on Friday with a 3-1 victory over Pepperdine.

UCSB (3-6 overall, 1-4 MPSF) defeated a ranked team after losing to top five opponents in three straight games.</p>\n<p>UCSB needed extra points to win the fourth and final set with a 28-26 victory. The Gauchos won the first and second sets 26-24 and 25-21 before dropping the third set 21-25.</p>\n<p>“It was one of the best feelings I’ve ever had,” junior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “I’m super stoked; I couldn’t be any happier.”</p>\n<p>Evans recorded 14 kills in the match for the Gauchos in what was his first MPSF victory after transferring from SBCC this year.</p>\n<p>Freshman outside hitter Kevin Donohue recorded a team-high 17 kills, a career high to go along with nine digs.</p>\n<p>“Kevin had a great match, he is a really competitive guy,” McLaughlin said. “He just wasn’t going to come out of there without a win. He wanted it bad and he did what it took. He led our team to victory.”</p>\n<p>Though an area of concern thus far in conference play, blocking was much improved for the Gauchos in the match against Pepperdine, as they recorded a season-high 15.5 team blocks. Junior middle blocker Dylan Davis recorded a game-high seven blocks to go along with seven kills.</p>\n<p>“[Winning] feels pretty darn good,” Davis said. “We had a phenomenal practice on Thursday. I think that really helped us stay a little more focused in the game, and I think everyone was ready to play the game and win.”</p>\n<p>Pepperdine lost its second in a row after falling to UCLA, the only team undefeated in the MPSF. The Waves, who fell to the Bruins in five sets, committed 28 total errors, compared to 20 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“If we play like that, we can compete with anyone, for sure,” McLaughlin said. “If we play the way we did, we’re going to be in a battle with UCLA.”</p>\n<p>Players and coaches unanimously agreed it was the team’s best performance of the season and should be important to help team morale after four straight losses.</p>\n<p>“Confidence is what it’s all about,” McLaughlin said. “That’s what getting these guys experience is for, so they got confident and comfortable out there on the court. When you can do it by getting a win over one of the top teams in the country, it’s a big thing.”</p>\n<p>Donohue and fellow freshman outside hitter Weston Nielsen both played pivotal roles for the Gauchos in the victory, providing depth for a young team returning only one starter from last year’s national runner-up team.</p>\n<p>“They’re all stepping up right now, I think it’s going to be great when we finish up the season,” Davis said. “Donohue and Weston Nielsen both played out of their minds. It was really fun to watch.”</p>\n<p>With a conference victory under their belts, the Gauchos hope it is a sign of things to come.</p>\n<p>“We played with more energy than we’ve ever had in any of our matches,” Evans said. “We played every single point like it was the most important point of the match. We just fought for every point and fought as hard as we could.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts UCLA on Friday, Feb. 10 at 7 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44327\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/gauchos-nab-mpsf-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44327\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/gauchos-nab-mpsf-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/gauchos-nab-mpsf-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/gauchos-nab-mpsf-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/gauchos-nab-mpsf-win/","id":5421,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5420,5419,5418],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks for First MPSF Win at Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The start of MPSF conference play has not been kind to the No. 15 UCSB men’s volleyball team, as the Gauchos will attempt to win at Pepperdine today after losing their first four conference games.

Previously losing in straight sets to a pair of top-five teams in UCLA and USC, the schedule does not appear to get any easier for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We’re not worried about playing top teams, because we consider ourselves a top team,” junior outside hitter Miles Evans said. “We’re just worried about playing well ourselves, and making sure we do our job on our side of the net.”</p>\n<p>No. 9 Pepperdine sits in third place in the conference at 6-3 (5-2 MPSF) after nearly defeating No. 3 UCLA Wednesday night before falling 3-2.</p>\n<p>“Pepperdine does a lot of things well,” McLaughlin said. “They’ve always blocked very well. Last night, they served very well against UCLA. They’re ranked nine right now, but I think they’re one of the five best in the country.”</p>\n<p>Entering Wednesday’s match, Pepperdine freshman phenom outside hitter Josh Taylor led the entire MPSF in kills with 147 on the year, while junior opposite Maurice Torres was fourth with 118.</p>\n<p>“They’re a good serving team, but we’re a good passing team, so as long as we pass the ball we should be fine,” senior outside hitter Blaine Nielsen said. “We’ve got to bring some of that competitive energy that we have in practice out to the court in matches.”</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s match against Southern California allowed the Gauchos to insert a number of key reserves into the game, all of who are freshmen or sophomores. Playing particularly well this season has been a pair of freshmen in opposite Chris Hartig and outside hitter Kevin Donohue.</p>\n<p>“We’re searching for guys who want to compete hard,” McLaughlin said. “We’re finding some things we need to find out, so I think it’s real valuable playing all of the young guys and getting them time out there, and get them used to it.”</p>\n<p>Although junior middle blocker Dylan Davis and Evans are stalwarts in the starting lineup, no one’s spot is safe, as the Gauchos continue to search for a starting unit that can give UCSB its first conference victory.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to go with whoever gives us the best shot to win, that’s what it’s all about,” McLaughlin said. “We weren’t prepared [Wednesday] real well, and that falls on us, the coaches. We have to get our guys prepared better.”</p>\n<p>Evans has been a main catalyst of the Gauchos’ offense, leading UCSB in kills and ranking fifth in the conference at nearly four per set. Santa Barbara will need Evans and the entire Gaucho offense to work nearly perfectly to beat the Waves.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely going to have to play smarter,” Evans said. “We’re going to have to minimize our errors on our side of the net. They run a fast offense and we’re going to have to block better than we have been. If we just execute our strategy, we can beat these teams.”</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB is ranked last in the MPSF in blocks, averaging less than two per set.
