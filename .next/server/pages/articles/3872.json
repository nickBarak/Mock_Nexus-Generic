Unable to conduct a stop due to traffic, the deputies followed the vehicle, which eventually made a right onto El Colegio Road and then a left onto Stadium Road.</p>\n<p>As the truck turned onto Stadium Road, the driver crossed the double yellow lines, prompting the deputies to pull him over.</p>\n<p>While standing at the driver’s side window, the officer immediately detected the pungent odor of burnt marijuana emanating from within the truck. The deputy asked if there was any pot in the car and the driver admitted that he and his passengers had hot-boxed the truck earlier that evening. He then assured the officer there wasn’t anymore weed – or at least he couldn’t remember there being anymore.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old male then produced a brightly colored pipe, complete with burnt residue. The driver told the deputies the piece belonged to his passenger, however the man riding shotgun was unable to produce a valid medical marijuana card.</p>\n<p>The driver was then asked to step out of the truck while an officer checked the vehicle for any hidden drugs. Unfortunately for this stoner, the floor beneath the passenger seat just wasn’t a good hiding spot and, after a short search, the deputy produced a small baggie containing less than an ounce of weed.</p>\n<p>The red-eyed Rasta was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of a controlled substance and was required to pee into a cup. He was later released into the care of his sober passenger, pending a later court date.</p>\n<p>Brown-Bagging It<br>\nTues., May 27, 4:28 p.m. – Officers on an afternoon patrol received a complaint of an intoxicated subject disturbing pedestrians in Anisq’ Oyo’ Park.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, deputies spotted a 47-year-old male staggering about the park, yelling at an innocent bystander. As if his actions – and his breath – weren’t tips enough, the belligerent day-drinker was also toting a 40-shaped brown paper bag.</p>\n<p>The officer told the man to take a seat, but before obliging, the drunkard poured out his beer and tossed the bottle behind him. Dutifully, the deputy went to fetch the litter.</p>\n<p>The officer placed the bottle back in front of the elderly drunk, only to have him pick it up and throw it once more.</p>\n<p>Deciding it was best to just leave the bottle as is, the deputy asked the man – whose eyes were bloodshot and watering – how much alcohol he had consumed. The man yelled back, “I don’t care. Take me to jail.”</p>\n<p>The deputy didn’t have to be told twice. He arrested the man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

academy aimed at providing free, world-class education around the globe.</p>\n<p>Khan, who holds degrees from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University and authored the acclaimed novel <em>The One World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined </em>(2012), transformed his over-the-phone tutoring skills into a YouTube channel and website called Khan Academy. Currently, the Khan Academy has a library of over 7,000 tutoring videos and receives up to 14 million visitors each month.</p>\n<p>Khan said he spent many afternoons tutoring his cousins and while tutoring his 12-year-old cousin Nadia he had several of what he called ‘aha moments’ that made him realize the impact he could have through education.</p>\n<p>Khan said he is proud to empower students to succeed in disciplines for which they have been told they do not have the “gene.”</p>\n<p>“There’s something very powerful here,” Khan said. “We now can tell the student, ‘Keep working on it. You haven’t mastered it yet,’ because the tools are there now.”</p>\n<p>Khan also said there is “a lot to be done” in terms of education, but he hopes to make his tools available to “level the playing field” for students who don’t have access to other resources.</p>\n<p>“The deck isn’t stacked against them as much as they think,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Hamza Bhatti said Khan’s videos helped him throughout high school in classes like calculus, physics and biology and his younger brother now uses the Academy.</p>\n<p>“It was really cool to hear his voice in person instead of a blackboard,” Bhatti said. “My little brother is in eighth grade right now, so he’s going to be involved with Khan Academy, and that’s why I wanted to come.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67608\" style=\"width: 342px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67608\" data-attachment-id=\"67608\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/creator-of-khan-speaks-about-education/salman-khan_by-alex-payne-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Salman Khan (Khan Academy)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67608\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3-682x1024.jpg?resize=332%2C499\" alt=\"Alex Payne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"332\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Salman-Khan_by-Alex-Payne-3.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67608\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Payne / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Bhatti said he appreciated Khan’s description of his college experience, in which Khan recounted social and academic challenges.</p>\n<p>“For [Khan] to say that he submitted 40 [job] applications and didn’t get any of them, but then the 41st paid off, it was like the light of day, and something that I want to pass on to my little brother,” Bhatti said.</p>\n<p>Wan Pei Fung, second-year biology major and exchange student from Singapore, said she attended the event because she uses Khan’s videos both at UCSB and in Singapore.</p>\n<p>“I really used a lot of [Khan’s] videos for chemistry and physics so I wanted to come and learn more about Khan Academy,” Fung said.</p>\n<p>Fung said Khan’s statement that “anything worth doing is something you can fail at” encouraged her to take on challenges.</p>\n<p>“For me, I don’t want to do something because I know I’m not good at it, like physics and computer science,” Fung said. “But after that, I realized that I have to try, and that failing might be a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Sydni Baker said that her favorite part of Khan’s lecture was his message to students to participate in activities they enjoy.</p>\n<p>“I feel, like, validated.

about learning, the pursuit of knowledge and what it means to be a student,” Brandwein said.</p>\n<p>Khan said he hopes to continue to reach more students in hopes of giving them “agency over their learning” and “agency over their life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Barbara County Board of Supervisors allocated $128,000 in contingency funds last week for additional shelter services for the approximately 1,400 homeless individuals seeking refuge from El Niño rain storms.</p>\n<p>Proposed by County Supervisors Doreen Farr and Steve Lavagnino, the two-fold project allocates $91,000 for two daytime shelter locations and provides $37,000 for night warming centers to be available an additional 15 nights. The five warming centers, including the Isla Vista location at the University Methodist Church, have already been activated 27 out of the planned 50 nights across the county, compared to 13 nights this time last year.</p>\n<p>Farr said addressing the needs of the homeless residents could not be put off due to predictions of increasingly poor weather over the next several months.</p>\n<p>“People need to be cared for sooner, rather than later, so that they don’t get sick. In some cases with the homeless, they will die on the street if they’re not cared for,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office volunteer chaplain, also said the homeless are at risk in the winter weather.</p>\n<p>“We may not have snow and frostbite here, but it gets pretty close to it, and sooner or later that takes a toll,” Hedges said. “That’s why so many of the folks … died way before, some of them in their late 20s.”</p>\n<p>The warming centers, active Nov. 15 through Mar. 31, provide shelter from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. on nights when the overnight temperature drops below 35 degrees, there is a 50 percent chance of rain predicted for two consecutive nights or a 50 percent chance of temperatures less than 40 degrees for two consecutive nights. According to Farr, the day shelter program was developed to provide a companion piece to the warming centers.</p>\n<p>“That system has worked very well, but there was a concern that that wasn’t enough, that we needed something during the day,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>The day shelters will likely be located at Earl Warren Showgrounds and at Santa Maria’s Minami Center in North County. While these locations are less easily accessible than the five warming centers across the county, Farr said a form of transportation may be provided to shuttle homeless residents to the day centers.</p>\n<p>“We did work with some transit providers, like Easy Lift, to say if we’re able to get these day shelters up and running. If people need assistance in getting there … the people at the warming shelter at night when they’re released at 6 in the morning, we could provide a shuttle service from the warming center locations to the closest day center,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Junior Anguiano, Community Affairs Board hunger/houseless co-coordinator and second-year film and media studies and psychology double major, said it is important to provide transportation for the homeless.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them have everything they own on a bike, and you can’t just throw that on a bus and go downtown and have to make that trek,” Anguiano said. “There is no established shelter in I.V. other than the warming center.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said while Reverend Frank Schaefer has been very gracious to open up the University Methodist church as a warming center, the issue of shelter for the homeless individuals in I.V. is about more than just “ducking in to get a dry place to sleep.”</p>\n<p>“The solution really is finding a place, helping us find a place, agitating with us to find a place,” Hedges said. “Also, volunteering with things like Doctors Without Walls, student health outreach, SWIPES.”</p>\n<p>Hedges said he also encourages students, when they feel safe, to reach out to homeless individuals in I.V. in small ways.</p>\n<p>“If nothing else, maybe buying somebody a cup of coffee, giving them a justification for being in the Starbucks,” Hedges said. “You know, you see some guy there cold and wet, buy him a cup of coffee.”</p>\n<p>Hedges also said he wants UC Santa Barbara to “step up as a neighbor” in finding a long-term solution for housing those living on the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Long range, the University is building all kinds of stuff here … In all of that development I hope there is some provision for the poor among us,” Hedges said. “Some of the [homeless] folks that have died on the street here started out as students at UCSB … I’m not looking for anyone to come riding in with a bag full of money, but at least let’s be part of the plan together.”</p>\n<p>Anguiano also said the homeless community of I.V. is very different than that of cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco and students should take the time to hear their stories and share their own.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them come here because they want to hear what college students have to say or the things we’re thinking about,” Anguiano said. “Just talking with them … one-on-one getting to know them, like you’d get to know anyone. Just because they’re houseless doesn’t take away their humanity.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67741\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67741\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/","id":3870,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[3869,3868,3867],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-01-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sunday, Dec. 30, 9:00 p.m. - An officer performing a routine traffic stop at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero del Mar was rudely interrupted when a woman drunkenly stumbled between his...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Truth Will Set You Free-ish.<br>\nSunday, Dec. 30, 9:00 p.m. – An officer performing a routine traffic stop at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero del Mar was rudely interrupted when a woman drunkenly stumbled between his patrol vehicle and the other subject.</p>\n<p>The 26-year-old woman approached the officer – already busy protecting and serving – and began to spit out incomprehensible slurs.</p>\n<p>The officer put his former engagement on hold momentarily and turned to face the sloshed siren. Quickly, the bloodshot eyes and strong odor of alcohol led the officer to suspect a high level of intoxication. Also, she was not wearing shoes. The officer kindly asked the woman to sit on the curb until he finished his prior engagement with the unfortunate driver.</p>\n<p>Having let the vehicle go, he turned to the woman and asked what she needed. The woman, apparently following George Washington’s famed maxim, replied, “I’m drunk, I’m not going to lie.” When asked just how much she had drunk, the woman continued to show her truthful side, confessing, “[A] lot.”</p>\n<p>“I drink too much,” she added.</p>\n<p>When asked to stand up, her bare feet were unable to provide the necessary balance and the officer decided to arrest her.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>See Spot Drink…</p>\n<p>Saturday, Dec. 29, 2:00 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 700 block of Camino del Sur happened across a woman screaming and waving her arm in the air with a man behind her holding on to her shoulder.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached in their patrol car, the male subject left the agitated woman behind and proceeded to walk in the opposite direction at a brisk pace, looking back once to check out the situation.</p>\n<p>The officer, fearing the man would flee, sprung to action, jumping out of the car while yelling at him to come back. He did, albeit not as briskly as before.</p>\n<p>The officer started slapping handcuffs onto the subject, suspecting a possible assault. Suddenly the officer noticed that the man’s arrest was angering the woman. “You’re fucking arresting him?” she screamed out in a slurred and incoherent voice.</p>\n<p>The officer turned his attention to the 19-year-old woman, who he quickly determined was heavily intoxicated. Further questioning revealed the underling reason for her highly agitated state. Ignoring all the officer’s questions, the woman instead asked him, “Is my dog hurt?”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the drunken canine lover’s responses continued to involve her dog, despite the absence of any furry friends within the area.</p>\n<p>Further inquiry into the subject revealed that the 21-year-old man was a co-worker of hers who had simply offered to walk his friend home. The alcohol, however, had apparently blacked out any concrete memory of where she lived and the two wandered up and down the entire length of Camino del Sur for nearly an hour before they stumbled upon Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she spent the night in the doghouse, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Transporter<br>\nTuesday, Jan. 1, 12:35 a.m. – Choosing to roost between a hard place and a bush, a 20-year-old female woke up for the first time in 2008 to the glare of a Foot Patrol flashlight.</p>\n<p>Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive came across a woman wedged between a tall bush and a parked truck, seemingly asleep yet still standing. Her belt was half off and she seemed to have lost her shoes.</p>\n<p>When approached by deputies, the motionless woman mumbled, “I’m not driving them home.” When asked what she was doing, she repeated, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>Officers informed her that her sleep aid – the truck next to her – was empty, and no one else was present. The distinct lack of anyone to drive did not quell her concern, however. When asked why her belt was half off, she announced, much to officers’ surprise, “I’m not driving them home.”</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the woman to step out from between the truck and the bush and onto the sidewalk. Balance, however, was not the would-be-driver’s forte, and she stumbled and fell into the officer’s arms.</p>\n<p>The sleepy souse had a few fresh scratches on her arm, but was unable to explain their presence to the officer, apparently forgetting her recent stint in a bush.</p>\n<p>The women was arrested and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15389\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15389\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-01-10/police-blotter-21/","id":3871,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3870,3869,3868],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
