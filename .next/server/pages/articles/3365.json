The “sick-out” on Wednesday was planned to coincide with a UC Regents meeting, in which the UCSC strikers planned to address the UC Office of the President directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Wednesday demonstration focused on the parallels between the challenges faced by UCSB and UCSC graduate students, such as steep housing costs, and the high number of students at both schools who are considered “rent-burdened,” meaning that they pay more than 30% of their income toward rent. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the UCSB Graduate Student Association took an informal poll of roughly 600 graduate students and found that respondents, on average, spent 48% of their $2,091.98 monthly income on rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers said that the “sick-out” was meant to draw attention to the COLA movement and gather support from graduate and undergraduate students who may not be aware of the movement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s people [here] from [the Graduate Student Association] …  but this is really a separate movement that grad students have started,” said Emily, one of the organizers of Wednesday’s event who declined to give her last name. She explained that the group was mostly composed of union members from UAW 2865.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Similar to Santa Cruz, this is grad students coming up, standing up and saying, ‘What we’re dealing with now is unacceptable,’ and so we’re really following their lead on that,” Emily added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to calling in sick on Wednesday, close to 150 graduate students and supporters marched from Storke Tower to the Arbor, chanting, “C-O-L-A, we need fair pay!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once in the Arbor, several graduate students spoke to the crowd and to students who stopped to watch the demonstration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of you may be wondering why grad students are rallying today … it’s because of the immense hardships that we’re facing. We can choose to keep our heads down and go on with business as usual. Or we can speak up about these hardships,” Rammy Salem, a graduate student in the psychological and brain sciences department, said to the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of us are homeless. Some of us skip meals. Some of us have to work multiple jobs and still work paycheck-to-paycheck,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of us think the cost of living is way too expensive — that ain’t right. So if you agree that grad students deserve to live dignified lives, support the movement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers called for the support of undergraduate students, staff and faculty as well, stressing that “it’s not just grad students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pratik Raghu, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Global Studies, said to the crowd that he was at the demonstration because he knew he was just “one serious medical accident away from potentially losing [his] apartment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all out here because we know that we are past the point of asking nicely. Asking nicely doesn’t do shit,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So let’s be a little less nice to the university — in fact, let’s be a lot less nice in making these demands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raghu said in an interview afterwards that he was “nothing more than a participant” in the demonstration, although he felt compelled to speak to the crowd in the Arbor because he is an international student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would hope that we can continue to show strength in numbers as we did on this particular occasion, and I hope that we can come up with a collective program of action that can help us maintain that strength in numbers,” Raghu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other international graduate students spoke to the Nexus about the restrictions they face due to their visas and how that can impact their ability to support themselves throughout the year. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordan Tudisco — an international graduate student in the comparative literature department — said that international students in particular are struggling because their visas do not allow them to work for any employer other than the university, excluding a select few </span><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international student work programs. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If UCSB decides not to employ me over the summer, I cannot work somewhere else,” they said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Kagan-Moore, a graduate student in the Department of History of Art and Architecture, said that graduate students as a whole struggle over the summer when there are fewer teaching appointments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve had a couple of health issues that essentially bankrupted me this summer,” Kagan-Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because we make so little as instructors of record and as TAs, that has had an extraordinarily deleterious effect on my ability to do my own research and my ability to serve my students. It is a holistic problem and the amount of labor that we render to this institution should be compensated,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Wednesday’s demonstration, organizers said they plan to regroup to begin drafting demands. Emily added that the demonstration was designed to involve more people in the discussions so the meetings are “as representative as possible of the grad student population.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were chatting, we were creating community, because [this demonstration] is a thing of creating community among graduate students,” said Azucena Trincado</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a graduate student in the Spanish and Portuguese department. “In graduate school, you feel kind of isolated or separated in departments.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think, for [the university], it’s good to maintain us divided, and we are showing that we can unite,” Trincado said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [1/23/2020 10:19 a.m.]: A previous version of this article said that speaker Rammy Salem said “<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us think the cost of learning is way too expensive.” The article has been corrected to reflect that he said “Most of us think the cost of living is way too expensive.” </span></em></p>\n<p><em>Correction [1/23/2020 5:27 p.m.]: A previous version of this article referred to Tudisco with the wrong pronouns.

And what a year. Excuse me for taunting you with my superiority complex and self-fellating egoism, but this is the column to do it in. My goodbye column. My au revoir to the Daily Nexus. My exit stage left.</p>\n<p>We got some redesigns, plumped up our columnists to opinion page ratio, hired the best staff this side of the Goleta Slough, broke top news, saved the Nexus from government ineptitude with the cunning use of middle-fingering, and hey, along with the Daily Sound, we’re the only daily newspaper left in this city. Cheers!</p>\n<p>Yep, to answer your next question, I am pretty hot shit.</p>\n<p>And I owe it all to you. No, not you, the average reader, reading this. I mean the people below in the staff box, and all those who came before and all those yet to come. Thank you, Brendan Buhler, Jason La (I learned the most from you), Daniel Haier, Matt Dozier. My hat’s off to Kristen Richer. Thanks for the memories; hope y’all join me in Nexus Valhalla for a few drinks.</p>\n<p>Where would I be without my loyal staff this year? It’s rare to work with people you love, and even rarer to work with people you respect and trust to do the job well.</p>\n<p>My friends, I wish I had the words, I often do, but they say to write from your heart and since you have half of mine, this message will be a slice of what it could have been.</p>\n<p>To Devon Claire Flannery, for being my first lieutenant and second set of eyes, particularly for catching all those potentially ugly mistakes (as well as the ones that got through). You not only polished the paper, you made it sparkle. You also kept us out of a lot of trouble, while managing to raise hell. If I weren’t such a stickler, I give you a smiley emoticon right now.</p>\n<p>Police Blotter extraordinaire Nikki Moore – barrel of monkeys level of fun and Southern Comfort level of intoxicating. You steered a big ship at county desk, and brought in too many catches to count. Here’s to your passion; it made it all the while.</p>\n<p>David Ferry. Stop whatever you’re doing. No, put it down. Put Aria down. And yes, there is a Santa Claus. He’s bringing you pants without holes in them.</p>\n<p>Dana Olsen, you’ve got a big job ahead of you, one I know you’re ready for. Have fun covering county supervisors, court cases, drunken revelry and the occasional dead albino raccoon. You’ll do it with flare and maybe a “Legends of the Hidden Temple” shirt.</p>\n<p>Miss Lindsey Miller – you were a constant counselor, a wise peer and a good friend. You did a better job at university desk than I, and probably with a lot less yelling. I’m glad we grew up in the office together. The honor was all mine. (Comma splice!)</p>\n<p>Megan “I’m not 15” Snedden: I had you picked out from day one, kid. You’re going far. You deserve nothing less. When I own my own paper, I’ll let you cover Leg again, if you really want it.</p>\n<p>Aria Miran. You and Ferry need a timeout. But really, a few laughs and inappropriate jokes with you make the medicine go down. You definitely make it to my top eight MySpace friends list. Even as a fresh-faced reporter you stuck out as something more, like a fresh-faced university editor. Welcome to the desk; I wouldn’t want it left in any other hands.</p>\n<p>I’m really sorry, Sabrina Ricci, for all those times we accidentally called you “Christina Ricci” when you weren’t in news meeting. Now you know. And now I’m graduating, so you can’t get mad. You got heart and the fortunate job of “layout editor,” complete with all the sexual innuendos associated with “laying” stuff out.</p>\n<p>Aaron Wu and Matt O’Leary, y’all put up with some confused editors, last minute shots and spectacularly boring board meetings. Thank you for your endless patience. We would be spectacularly boring without you. And sans pretty pictures.</p>\n<p>To my most valuable player and fellow graduate Anna Oleson-Wheeler. What didn’t you do? AOW, with a flick of your wrist you had AP, reception and production under wraps, with a bit of nod to sports. Thanks for the memories and double thanks for the booze.</p>\n<p>To Barb Maclean, Linda Meyer and J.E. Anderson. Your devotion to us kids knows no bounds, and your guidance was irreplaceable. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope we made you proud.</p>\n<p>More with sports, we got Chris Hoffman, but my heart belongs to Monique Moyal and Jeff Gibson. Monique, we missed you. And Jeff, you need to stop stressing. You should try pot sometime.</p>\n<p>Those cool kids at Artsweek – Mollie Vandor, Sophia Kercher and my fellow Lasallian Cameron Smith – thanks for putting up with the changes, but also thanks for delivering the hipster to our pages. It’s nice not being lame through and through.</p>\n<p>Oh, Nicki Arnold. Way to hold the fort down in the opinion office, and thank you for being a great staff writer the year before. You are the bee’s knees, and have a contagious smile.</p>\n<p>Mark Batalla, my answer to your question is “Oh. Dear. God. Sigh. Fine, print it.” You were my happiest excuse never to censor, and I’m glad you trusted to ask me first. You dedicated more of your talent here than just about anyone, and it certainly didn’t go unnoticed. I’d mention each of your artists by name, but I’d rather someone write in angry about it so I could see more of their work. You all made the opinion page everyone’s first stop in the morning. It was a pleasure.</p>\n<p>Online Editor Craig Calkins, Jesus Christ you stepped it up. We’ll make it to that shining city of perfect websites one of these days. You were tenacious, talented and occasionally morally perverse, a contradiction wrapped in a certainty. I don’t even know what I just wrote, but you were awesome.</p>\n<p>But I’m eager to get on you, copy cats. Copy, you will always be loved, sometimes feared, with nothing but a comma and an adverb separating the two. Dianne Jobson, good luck in your new position. Just slow down on the caffeine pills. Kate Rushton, I’m glad to be graduating with you, though I’ll also be glad to see you at your new beginnings – you’ve got the right stuff. Valerie Tidwell, not only are you a worthy redhead, you’re also the sharpest knife in the drawer, capable of cutting anyone down to size. You were a miracle staff writer as well.</p>\n<p>Melissa Davis and Becky Gayle, you deserve a special place in my heart, and I will miss you. Melissa, McCarthy was a bad man. Becky, goddamn we missed you.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to name all of you, copy (par for the course, right?). Just know you had the hardest job and a hushed respect in the office. You made my nights a joy, and my newspaper the best I’ve seen. Thank you so much.</p>\n<p>How much happiness it brings me to end with you, Nick DŸrnhšfer. The wisest advice I received when I became editor I will now pass on to you: It doesn’t matter if you break the biggest story of the century, or take down some bad guys or win first place awards in every category. It matters that you take care of the Nexus so that one day, your successor can. You’ve learned all you can from me, and outpaced my creativity. I got a sneaking feeling you’re going to be that first-place-winning successor.</p>\n<p>Just remember that a year from now, all this will seem very funny. You have no idea what that means now. I didn’t when Dozier told me, or when Daniel told him, etc. You’ll get it. But don’t rush there. You got some time to put in.</p>\n<p>Goodbye, my friends. So long, and see you later. Goodnight Nexus, one last time.<br>\nYour Friend,<br>\nKaitlin Pike</p>\n<p>P.S. Oh, and to Jerry Roberts: Don’t worry, I would never sue you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

</span><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers, including UCSB students and community organizers, gave speeches on their personal experiences with racism, institutionalized oppression in higher education and the importance of allyship. The procession of approximately 100 then walked to North Hall, stopping at the mural that honors the students who protested there for Black rights in 1968, before ending at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) for lunch.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was hosted by the Martin Luther King Jr. Committee of Santa Barbara, UCSB’s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the MCC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chris Hudley, vice president of the Martin Luther King Jr. Committee, elaborated on the importance of the theme “Remembering The Silence of Our Friends,” which comes from the famous King quote: “We remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During political years, we have forgotten to have conversations,” Hudley explained. “We want the idea of people having conversations, learning and collaborating, to build inclusiveness and equality.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inclusion of friends in conversation was emphasized throughout the event; participants were asked to talk to strangers during the walk about the change they wish to see in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alyssa Frick-Jenkins, president of UCSB’s Black Student Union, discussed the Eternal Flame monument, where the walk begins. The Flame was donated as a gift by the UCSB Class of 1968 to commemorate peace and unity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, the Eternal Flame … commemorates the ongoing legacy of MLK because he lit a similar flame under Black students to take under North Hall and demand equality. I find it important for Black students and those who understand their struggle to not only see the monument as one to MLK’s legacy but also one about taking up space in this institution,” Frick-Jenkins said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frick-Jenkins’ ideas of “self determination, Black freedom and liberation,” which were recurring themes throughout the event, led to a discussion of empowerment in institutions of higher education like UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Take up space here,” Frick-Jenkins told attendees. “We can see ourselves within this institution that was not inherently made for the education of Black people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deandre Miles-Hercules, president of the Black Graduate Students Association, touched on their personal experiences as a Black, gender nonconforming individual and, similarly to Frick-Jenkins, their struggle with taking up space in academia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is important for me personally, because I am Black and gender nonconforming and as a scholar that is not often a comfortable place to be, and in the world that it is often dangerous and harmful to be in,” Miles-Hercules said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MLK said direct action is presenting our very bodies to the conscience of the public of our national and local communities,” they explained. “My presence and showing up authentically is direct action. That too is walking in Dr. King’s legacy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While talking to the crowd, Miles-Hercules also emphasized how their presence at UCSB is statistically unlikely. In the 2017-18 academic year, only 3% of graduate students were Black, whereas 5.8% of California residents were Black, a nearly 3% difference between state and university demographics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Regent Elect and UCSB graduate student Jamaal Muwwakkil, another speaker, reiterated this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not supposed to be here. I’m a poor kid from Compton, California. The statistics are against me … I was not supposed to gain access to the UC. The paradigm for Black students is that diversity lowers standards, that the more Black students you have, the lower the ranking of your school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anne H. Charity-Hudley, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Hall Endowed Chair in the Linguistics of African America</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and linguistics professor, encouraged attendees to discuss with others what made them come out to the event on their walk to North Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miriam Bankons, a participant who has been coming to the event for five years, was eager to share her answer to Charity-Hudley’s question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m here in memory of all the people that came before me and walking for them,” she said. “Talking to other people that we don’t know, that we don’t see, is a way to honor King. His holiday is about a day of service, and I believe this is a way of service.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the march reached North Hall, Charity-Hudley recounted the racism she has experienced while achieving success in academia, including being targeted by police and having drawings of lynchings painted on her wall after receiving a raise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In many positions, people are happy to see Black people on campus until they receive raises, labs and support. There’s a level of tension when we don’t stay in our place … I want you to think about how we can continue to rise until you make somebody else nervous with your level of success.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participants then walked to the MCC to enjoy lunch, celebrate successes made in the name of Black empowerment and listen to MLK’s most famous speeches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many attendees discussed how Miles-Hercules’s words resonated with them, especially their ending comments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Be a brother, a sister, be a partner in crime to equity and justice, and show up when things are hard and let go of some of that privilege that you might bear in the service of equity and justice,” Miles-Hercules said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That is how we walk in Dr. King’s footsteps and honor his memory.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

legitimate chapter of the national Rock the Vote organization. <em>Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no public questioning of the group’s practices until</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SBStudentActivistNetwork/posts/rock-the-vote-sb-has-been-caughtrock-the-vote-sb-has-been-masquerading-for-month/1810602312406454/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a Facebook post </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">published on Jan. 11 by the Student Activist Network alleged that Rock the Vote SB was not a legitimate chapter of the national Rock the Vote organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rock the Vote SB stole the logo of a nonprofit that has national recognition for being a nonpartisan, get-out-the-vote effort. They then set up a nonprofit and used that branding of that trusted nonprofit, basically as a way to say that their organization is objective and is to be trusted,” said Ry Brennan, a member of the Student Activist Network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> representative from the national Rock the Vote organization confirmed that Rock the Vote SB was formed in August 2019 as a part of the larger organization, but as of now is “not a legitimate chapter.” They also said that the national organization sent Rock the Vote SB a cease-and-desist letter in December.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former Rock the Vote SB Executive Director Robin Howe explained in a statement that Rock the Vote SB was a compliant chapter with the national organization beginning in August 2019. In November, he was told that Rock the Vote DC “received complaints” regarding the Rock the Vote SB operation. Rock the Vote SB initially “wholeheartedly attempted to work with them to bring our operation into compliance,” he said, but was asked by the national organization in December to “drop our affiliation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock the Vote SB then “immediately ceased operation[s],” Howe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe added that the Student Activist Network’s allegations –– which included that Rock the Vote SB suppressed the vote in I.V. by encouraging online voter registration, telling people their car insurance would go up if they voted in Isla Vista and that the group encouraged people to vote at home instead of in I.V. ––  were “misleading and unverified.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations of voter suppression not only relate to Rock the Vote but also alleged ties to Bruce Porter, a candidate running for the third district seat in the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors March election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe said that in August 2019, he responded to a post on the Rock the Vote SB website that stated the group was hiring. He then was “introduced to and met briefly with Bruce Porter,” who “mentioned his intention was to create a non-partisan voter registration group in Isla Vista.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a letter Porter sent to his supporters on Jan. 15, which was obtained by the Nexus, Porter discussed Rock the Vote’s alleged intent to cause low voter turnout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Congressman Salud] Carbajal and [Supervisor Joann] Hartmann went all out to crush the nonpartisan voter registration effort in Isla Vista and shotgun accusations of voter suppression,” Porter wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, Rock the Vote has done a fabulous job of providing truthful and objective voter registration education to students. The result: far more students chose to register back home and there are 1400 fewer students registered to vote in IV this year, compared to this point in 2016, even though the student population has significantly increased.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe told his staff in an email sent on Jan. 15 that operations were “on hold for the moment” due to “local political issues.” Howe told them in the email to refrain from wearing their T-shirts and doing any branding and to delete all social media accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers were left without a clear reason why all operations had ended out of nowhere as Howe instructed staff to tell current and potential volunteers “the schedule is full and no more volunteers are needed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple Rock the Vote SB volunteers spoke to the Nexus, saying they had no idea that the organization was illegitimate until this week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw a post on Free and For Sale that was basically just trashing Rock the Vote for all these allegations,” said Sean Price, a first-year pre-biology major. “At first I didn’t believe it, but then I found out that the website was gone, Facebook was gone; I haven’t checked their Instagram, but I’m sure that’s gone too. I didn’t hear anything from them when this all happened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second-year volunteer, who asked not to be named, said that they tried to reach out about changing their shift day for winter quarter and never heard back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I did get was an email about there’s been stuff going on this week with tabling. So I had no idea basically what was going on until I read an article on Facebook about that it could potentially be a fraudulent organization … they stopped tabling, and then just nothing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Student Activist Network raised three separate allegations against Rock the Vote SB accusing them of voter suppression in Isla Vista. The group alleges that Rock the Vote gave out voter registration cards at the Arbor instead of filling out physical forms, that they told people their car insurance costs would increase if they registered to vote in I.V. and that they encouraged people to vote at their home addresses in other parts of the state instead of in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers who spoke to the Nexus confirmed that official registration forms were “rarely” provided for tabling in favor of voter registration cards that directed people to the Rock the Vote SB website, which has since been shut down, to register to vote on their own time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the eyes of the Student Activist Network, handing out cards makes it less likely for students to register to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have tabled many times at the Arbor and I know that students are often walking by very, very quickly. They often take things that are handed to them and then immediately throw them away,” Brennan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best way to actually get somebody signed up to vote is to actually ask them to come over to your table and fill out the form. That is the only way that you could actually guarantee that the people who you have actually gotten to bring over to your booth are actually going to follow through … We only complicate the process when we ask people to go online to fill out forms.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe said in a statement that Rock the Vote SB encouraged online registration but “ALWAYS carried hardcopies of voter registration cards for those who preferred that method which we found to be rare because Gen Z generally is a digital culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One second-year volunteer, who requested their name not be used, said they were confused about why voter registration forms were not the norm but didn’t deeply question the practice because they believed Rock the Vote SB to be a legitimate organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel really frustrated because in retrospect looking back, things were sort of red flags,” they said. They added that they were made familiar with the organization through a UCSB honors mail listserv. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just never assumed that through an honors mail listserv that an actual, illegitimate thing could be presented to us students,” they said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another allegation raised by the Student Activist Network was that Rock the Vote SB told students that their car insurance rates would go up if they registered to vote in I.V., which they heard from multiple students who Rock the Vote SB volunteers had spoken with, but Howe rejected that claim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have never heard of the concept of car insurance rates getting raised nor did anything remotely close to that ever get discussed with my team,” Howe said in the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This claim is the most bizarre of them all. It is so obviously unbelievable it waves a red </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flag as to how low the people spreading these dishonest statements will go for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their own political gain.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No volunteers that the Nexus spoke with had ever heard of discussions about car insurance rates increasing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final issue raised by the Student Activist Network is that Rock the Vote SB suppressed the vote by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“dissuading people from registering in IV on the grounds that other elections in the Bay, LA, and San Diego are more contested,” according to its Facebook post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the backside of the Rock the Vote SB online voting card obtained by the Nexus, the card reads that “It’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Choice Where to Register,” whether that be at home or school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The card’s wording did not raise alarms for Price until this past week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are three places on the card: Los Angeles, San Diego and Bay Area issues, but nothing in Santa Barbara, like no reason to vote in Santa Barbara, and then there’s websites to each place about those issues,” Price said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It basically just said vote where you think your opinion matters more, like where you’ll make a difference, which is basically what I told people and what I thought was being advertised by them, but now I’ve heard that it’s not.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no further information from Howe or Rock the Vote SB in general, student volunteers for Rock the Vote SB have been left confused about where the organization stands and remain frustrated by new information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything looked very legit and no interactions that I had with anyone were bad. They were all just pretty straightforward. I was just to get my volunteer hours, so that’s really frustrating for someone who was trying to have volunteers actually make a difference and register people to vote and that’s important to me,” one volunteer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t help beating myself up, like why didn’t I, like, think this was a bigger issue at the time?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, I’m waiting for more information to come to light because I feel very taken advantage of,” Price said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I figured I was doing something to help voter registration and improve community involvement.
