Combined with UCSB struggling to score, Long Beach State took a 20-14 lead into the locker rooms.</p>\n<p>“We knew they were going to be changing defenses,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “They play man, they’ll press or play a one-three-one zone and I thought we came out very tentative. We knew what they were going to do, but we didn’t have the attack mentality early.”</p>\n<p>To open up the second half, UCSB caught fire and went on an 11-2 run, giving the Gauchos a three-point lead with 15:19 remaining.</p>\n<p>“In the locker room, Coach Mitch lit a fire under all of us,” Underwood said. “She wasn’t very happy with the output in the first half.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Angelei Aguirre led the comeback for UCSB, scoring all eight of her points in the second half. However, with approximately four minutes remaining, she fouled out, giving the 49ers momentum.</p>\n<p>“We challenged [Aguirre]; she’s got to be willing to accept the responsibility of being a senior,” Mitchell said. “She’s a physical player and has the ability to score in a variety of ways and she was able to do that in the second half.”</p>\n<p>Both teams traded baskets for the majority of the second half, but with just less than two minutes remaining and the score tied at 44, Long Beach State went on an 8-1 run, aided by UCSB turnovers.</p>\n<p>“We made a lot of critical mistakes at the end of the game,” Underwood said. “Long Beach is a good team and you can’t make critical mistakes in the end of the game and expect to win, so it’s on us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos turned the ball over six more times than the 49ers, two coming in the final 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Nesbit scored a game-high 15 points. while Underwood contributed a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its first conference home game of the season this Thursday when the team takes on University of the Pacific.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 7th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However, USC used excellent passing to find the open man on a Santa Barbara defense that typically ranks No. 20 nationally in three-point defense at 20.3 percent.</p>\n<p>“That’s not our personality to play a lot of zone,” Mitchell said. “They haven’t shot it extremely well in their first four games, so we thought we might mix it up a little bit more than usual.That’s always a chance you take.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were especially undersized with their two centers, senior Kirsten Tilleman and freshman Jessica Pino, sitting on the sidelines with injuries.</p>\n<p>“Well I think it’s obvious [not having them] made a major impact,” Mitchell said. “Tilleman [averages] eight rebounds a game, so that put the burden on Lei and Sweets, who had to guard a powerful post presence on the low block.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB made the end interesting, bringing the game within just six points with 1:19 remaining. However, the Trojans answered with none other than a three-pointer, icing the game.</p>\n<p>“I felt we didn’t come out in the first half the way we needed to,” senior guard Angelei Aguirre said. “We needed to redeem ourselves and play hard [in the second half ].”</p>\n<p>To start the game, UCSB jumped out to an early 18-17 lead. However, USC put together a 20-4 run to end the first half and begin the second half to give the team a 37-22 lead.</p>\n<p>“They were taking a lot of switches in everything we were running with screen and rolls, which is a major part of our offense,” Mitchell said. “We didn’t recognize the times of mismatches and I think we hit the panic button a little too quickly, so sometimes we were taking quick shots and should’ve executed a little longer.”</p>\n<p>Aguirre and freshman forward Kendra Morrison led the charge with Morrison tallying 11 points on the game, all of which came in the second half. Aguirre put the team on her back in the final period, running the point and scoring 11 of her 13 points.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to do anything I could to help us win and get back into the game, so I guess today that meant scoring points,” Aguirre said. “Any way I can help our team win is what I’m going to do.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be Saturday against St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 28th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/","id":704,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[703,702,701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Searching for Six","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The St. Mary’s women’s basketball team has never won a game in the Thunderdome and UCSB would like to keep it that way when it hosts the Gaels Saturday.

UCSB will also attempt to rebound from a tough loss to USC.</p>\n<p>“We need to earn our respect back and play harder and get back to the things that got us to the tournament last year, which was getting stops,” Aguirre said. “We didn’t do that against USC, so we need to get back to the defensive side of things. That’s our identity and at the end of the day, it’s [what] will win us games.”</p>\n<p>UCSB comes off a 62-51 loss against the Trojans in which a bad first half put Santa Barbara in a deep hole, going down by as many as 18 points in the second half. With 1:19 remaining, the Gauchos completed a 13-1 run and made the deficit just six points, but ran out of time to complete the comeback.</p>\n<p>“You’re at home; [consistency] shouldn’t even be a discussion,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We’re a veteran team … it’s inexcusable for us to not be prepared against a Pac-12 team that we knew what they were going to do. You know not every shot is going to go in, but I expected our team to compete and I didn’t feel we did that for the first 20 minutes.”</p>\n<p>A major highlight of the game was the play of Aguirre, who tallied a career-high 13 points. Aguirre put the team on her back and scored 11 second half points. She is also second on the team in assists with 2.3 per game.</p>\n<p>“Yeah I had a career-high, but it doesn’t mean anything because we didn’t win,” Aguirre said. “It’s my senior year and I want to go out winning Big West, and I want to build up our resume so we’re not playing Baylor again first round. So for me, these are the wins that we need.”</p>\n<p>Consistency will be a key for UCSB against St. Mary’s. Last season, the Gauchos dominated the first half, outscoring the Gaels 35-14, but almost gave the game away by allowing 38 points in the second half. In the end, Santa Barbara prevailed 61- 52 and Mitchell earned her first victory as a head coach.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Nicole Nesbit led UCSB with 15 points last year against the Gaels. This season, Nesbit leads the team in points per game with 11. The Gaels feature two big offensive threats in juniors Jackie Nared and Danielle Mauldin. Nared, a 6’1’’ guard, leads the team with 18.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. Mauldin nearly averages a double-double with 12.8 points and 9.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“We’ll probably use some different bodies on [Nared] and I know we’ll have to go back to what we do best and that’s our man defense,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Senior center Kirsten Tilleman did not play against USC and is questionable for tomorrow’s game. As a result, the Gauchos could be without their leader and one of its top rebounders as Tilleman averages 7.4 boards per game.</p>\n<p>“She brings so much to the table, not just rebounding,” Aguirre said. “She does so many things for us that people don’t even know because they don’t make the stat sheet.”</p>\n<p>Without Tilleman, the entire team will need to focus on rebounding. The Gaels hit the boards, averaging 47.2 rebounds per game, nearly 16 rebounds more than the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>In addition, while defense is always a focal point for the Gauchos as they lead the Big West in scoring defense at 53.5 points per game, UCSB has lived and breathed defense in practice this week, especially after a poor performance against USC in which the Trojans shot 56.2 percent from downtown.</p>\n<p>“Today [Thursday] was an hour and 45 minutes of defense and rebounding, absolutely nothing else,” Mitchell said. “We went back and watched the entire clips of USC and the kids had to be embarrassed at the performance we had against USC in all facets of the game.”</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s currently averages 68.4 points per game compared to UCSB’s 52.2 points per game, so the defense will need to be in full force for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49178\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-searching/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49178\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-searching/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-searching/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-searching/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-searching/","id":705,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[704,703,702],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Snap Two-Game Losing Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After losing two straight games, the second a 68-40 blowout to Wyoming, the UCSB men’s basketball team travels to face Santa Clara on Saturday night in search of its first road win of the season.

Wyoming outshot the Gauchos in free throws 27-3, with UCSB amassing 24 personal fouls compared to nine by the Cowboys.</p>\n<p>For Williams, this has grown into a trend where foul trouble has limited his playing time in several games this season.</p>\n<p>“It’s really frustrating to know that I can’t help my teammates out at all times and I have to sit back and watch them,” Williams said. “I want to be in there fighting with them; I want to be in there fighting for them. When I’m sidelined due to foul trouble, I can’t do that.”</p>\n<p>Despite limited playing time, Williams has been the team’s most consistent player, as he is the only Gaucho to score in double figures in each of its six games. Big Al is tied with Brown for the team lead in scoring with 14 points per game and leads the Gauchos in rebounding with over eight per game.</p>\n<p>Against Wyoming, Williams scored 11 points and grabbed nine rebounds in a mere 20 minutes of play. UCSB’s 40-point performance on Wednesday was a program low dating back to a 64-36 defeat to Pacific in 2006.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Kyle Boswell was the only other Gaucho to score in double figures with 10, while Brown and freshman guard Michael Bryson scored nine and eight points, respectively. The only other Gaucho to score in the blowout loss was freshman forward Mitch Brewe with two points.</p>\n<p>“We just weren’t in our rhythm [Wednesday],” Al Williams said. “It’s a stinker and we just have to let it go and prepare for the game on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Santa Clara, meanwhile, lost its first game of the season on Wednesday in an 80-78 defeat to Utah State in overtime. The Broncos started off the season with their first 5-0 record since 1968, fueled in large part by senior guard Kevin Foster’s team leading 21.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to get there and we’re going to keep fighting. Right now we’re having trouble offensively and defensively putting things together,” junior guard Kyle Boswell said. “I have no doubt that we’re going to get there.
