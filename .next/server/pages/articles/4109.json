Still, the season still has a ways to go as Santa Barbara will look to continue one of its best seasons in program history when it takes on UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Saying the Gauchos are in the midst of their best season ever is not much of an overstatement at this point considering they are off to their best start in school history with a 31-5 overall record. UCSB is also sitting atop the Big West standings with an 8-1 conference record following sweeps of UC Davis, UC Irvine and taking two of three at CSUF.</p>\n<p>In previous years, Santa Barbara going on the road would be enough to worry about the team faring well. In fact, before this year, UCSB was 76-91-1 in the Andrew Checketts era and the last two seasons in particular, the team was an abysmal 13-33.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This year, the Gauchos are 11-4 and if they win four of their final nine road matches that would be the most road wins in the Checketts era.</p>\n<p>This week, UCSB will take on a UCR team that is struggling. The Highlanders are currently 13-25 overall and sit at seventh in the conference with a 3-6 Big West mark. UCR is a much better 6-6 at home compared to a 7-19 record away from Riverside.</p>\n<p>Still, if UCR has any hopes of upsetting a hot UCSB team then it will need to focus on taking away its strong bats.</p>\n<p>Through its nine conference games, Santa Barbara is slashing .318/.372/.538. Specifically, the Gauchos .318 batting average and .538 slugging is first in the conference while its .372 on base percentage is second only behind Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Counting all games, not just conference, the Gauchos are the best team in the conference in nearly all statistics such as: batting average (.290), on-base percentage (.383), slugging percentage (.495), home runs (42), RBI’s (232), doubles (74), triples (22) and runs (258).</p>\n<p>Tommy Jew is one of the players directly responsible for this strong Gaucho offense. The junior center fielder currently sports a strong .296 batting average and in the last four games, he has gone 7-15 at the plate with two RBI’s and one home run. His 30 RBI’s are tied for the second-most on the team.</p>\n<p>Jew leads the team in homers with nine on the season and he has also been a terror on the base paths with 16 stolen bases, tied for the team best mark with fellow outfielder Tevin Mitchell.</p>\n<p>Jew has also been stellar defensively with a perfect fielding percentage and he has also made some great catches including one that stole a home run.</p>\n<p>Another very hot bat is senior designated hitter/catcher Thomas Rowan who comes into the series opener working a seven-game hit streak. In fact, Rowan has successfully earned a hit in all but six games this season.</p>\n<p>In the month of April, which UCSB has played in 12 games, Rowan is 18-43 (.418) with 12 RBI’s, four home runs, two extra-base hits and striking out just six times in 43 at bats. The senior has also had 14 multiple hit games this season in his 36 appearances.</p>\n<p>On the mound, the Gauchos do not get much easier. Michael McGreevy has quickly transformed himself into the first guy out of the bullpen for the Gauchos as the freshman sports a Big West best 1.62 ERA.</p>\n<p>Left-handed Saturday starting pitcher Jack Dashwood has also been hot as of late and was named Big West Pitcher of the Week this past Tuesday following a dominant performance against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>The sophomore tossed a three-hit, complete game shutout and was actually working a perfect game through seven innings before allowing back-to-back singles.</p>\n<p>Finally, ace closer Chris Lincoln, whose 10 saves are a league best, was recently named to the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association Stopper of the Year Midseason Watch List. The junior righty currently holds a 4.18 ERA and has struck out 25 batters in just 23.1 innings of work.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB does need to watch out for the Highlanders streak hitter, Connor Cannon. The junior right-handed pitcher/first baseman has been on an absolute tear the past two weeks winning back-to-back Big West Field Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>Last week, Cannon had a slash line of .588/.650/1.235 as he hit three home runs and knocked in 11 runs. He broke UCR’s program record for most RBI’s in a game with eight against New Mexico on April 19.</p>\n<p>Overall, this week is just another week for UCSB to inch closer to something it hasn’t laid claim to in more than 30 years, a Big West title. There is no time for complacency in conference play. 13 straight wins is great, but nothing compared to the other ambitions this team has.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on UC Riverside for game one of the series at 6 p.m. on Friday, April 26 at the Riverside Sports Complex.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

After getting an out in the inning, Dashwood gave up a single to freshman Brendan Brooks bringing another run to the plate and earning UCI the 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>RBI and home-run leading senior Ryan Fitzpatrick stepped up to the plate and cleared the bases with a left-center shot that put the Eaters up 5-1 at the end of three innings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ starter could not stop the bleeding and the UCI batters would pile on to their lead in the subsequent inning.</p>\n<p>The pair of Christian Koss and Matt Reitano would strike again in the bottom of the fourth inning when the pair earned their second RBI and run of the game respectively.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Konnor Zickefoose would also make his second trip around the bags and at the end of four, the Anteaters were ahead 7-1. The Zickefoose run would end Dashwood’s night at 3.1 innings pitched with seven earned runs.</p>\n<p>Clay Fisher would score the Gauchos’ final run of the game in the top of the eighth, but UCI simply added onto their lead even more in the bottom of the same inning.</p>\n<p>Senior Cole Kreuter hit a home run to start off the inning while sophomore Ryan Johnston and Ryan Fitzpatrick would each hit singles to bring home runners of their own. UC Irvine would end the first game of the series, victorious by eight at 10-2.</p>\n<p>It was a tale of two different pitchers as UCI’s starter Andre Pallante went the distance, giving up the lone earned run in the third over seven innings pitched. Pallante was able to keep the Gaucho bats silent before forcing his team to go to the bullpen to pull him.</p>\n<p>The sophomore has had a great month of April so far with 15 innings pitched, one earned run, and two wins over his two appearances. Much like the Dirtbags on his April 6 start, the Gauchos were similarly stifled and failed to get any significant offensive rhythm.</p>\n<p>Dashwood had an unexpectedly mediocre outing and is now the possessor of a less than exciting 2-5 record.</p>\n<p>The freshman had been on a recent wave of success before his start against UCI, going at least five innings pitched with one earned run or less in each of his past three starts.</p>\n<p>However, the 18.90 ERA posted for today’s game is Dashwood’s worst start of the season. No matter the lefty can certainly move along in the season with the assurance of seemingly nowhere to go but up.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue the series against the Anteaters on Saturday, April 14 at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82484\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82484\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/","id":4106,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4105,4104,4103],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Presented With Promising Opportunities Heading Into Weekend Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Baseball_vsSJSU-180323-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Baseball_vsSJSU-180323-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Coming in off a loss to USC in its midweek matchup just a few days ago, the UCSB baseball team will look to regroup with its final non-conference three-game weekend series of the 2018 campaign against...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_82201\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Baseball_vsSJSU-180323-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"981755195\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82272\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82201\" data-attachment-id=\"82201\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-06/ucsb-presented-with-promising-opportunities-heading-into-weekend-series/jack-dashwood-pitches-the-ball-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Baseball_vsSJSU-180323-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jack Dashwood pitches the ball.

UTRGV comes into this weekend series boasting a strong 16-13 overall record along with a 3-3 conference mark but has lost its last three games all by at least five runs and a combined 25 runs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This weekend will mark the first time these two programs meet in school history, and, as such, it is an important one for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Having lost to USC 9-3 on Tuesday, the Gauchos failed to capitalize on the chance of getting to .500 for the first time this season and to continue the momentum it had gained from taking two of three against perennial Big West powerhouse Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Despite this being the first time UCSB will take on UTRGV, it is no strangers to opponents from the WAC conference — the conference UTRGV belongs to.</p>\n<p>In the Checketts’ era, Santa Barbara has posted a 13-11 mark against Western Athletic Conference opponents with all of those games being against either Sac State, who it dropped two of three to earlier this year, or Cal State Bakersfield who it has yet to play this season. Against Texas schools in general during the Checketts’ era, UCSB has gone 8-15.</p>\n<p>“Honestly all the Texas teams we have played so far have been really talented so we are going to treat these guys like any other team and come out ready to play,” Lincoln said. “We are definitely confident. We know we have the talent to compete with anybody if we do all the things we know we can do.”</p>\n<p>This series is also important because it marks the end of the six-series, 21 of 22 game homestand the Gauchos were enjoying in the middle to latter part of its season. A series win against a quality opponent would be huge.</p>\n<p>UCSB has won its last two weekend series and a big part of that has been the pitching as it has only allowed an average of 2.5 runs per game in its last six weekend matches.</p>\n<p>“Obviously it starts with pitching and we have had some solid performances on the mound from guys like Ledesma who was great last week,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Being the Sunday starter, Stevie Ledesma has been nothing short of spectacular in his first three starts this season. In those games, the senior has tallied a 0.96 ERA and delivered a beauty in his win against CSUF last Sunday going 7.2 innings allowing just four hits, one earned run while striking out five.</p>\n<p>Right-hander Chris Lincoln has also been nothing short of solid these last few weeks recording a 2.70 ERA as a starter. He currently sports a 2.15 ERA on the year overall and has also recorded a career-high 27 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>“This is still a learning experience for me and I know I still have a lot to learn but I just want to put my team in the best position to win and I think I have done a decent job so far,” Lincoln said. “It’s been a lot of mental focusing this year and trying to attack hitters more this season and it’s paid off.”</p>\n<p>In his career, the sophomore has made six career starts but has yet to pick up a win. His lone victory of his career came in relief work. In three starts so far this season, Lincoln has earned a no decision in each outing but the ‘Chos have won each match.</p>\n<p>“So far this year all of my starts have been team wins and I am happy with that and I know if I keep working the win will come, but yeah absolutely I’d like to get my first [win],” Lincoln said.</p>\n<p>With former bullpen pitchers now becoming starts, UCSB has needed other guys to fill those roles and sophomore Shea Barry and freshman Chris Troye has done just that.</p>\n<p>“Shea Barry has been great out of the pen and Chris Troye looks like he is getting healthier and consistent so that’s a boost,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>This season, Barry has a 2-0 record and one save with a 3.09 ERA and 12 K’s while Troye, who struggled earlier this year, has allowed zero runs in his last two outings in relief.</p>\n<p>One thing the Gauchos do have to worry about is replacing stud freshman Andrew Martinez to an injury. This year he has become a defensive star and had a .319 batting average with four homers.</p>\n<p>“Losing Martinez is tough but [Marcus] Castanon has done a great job filling in at shortstop but now we need to fill our second base spot so really that is key for us going forward,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Overall this weekend could be a real turning point for the Gauchos but it needs to take advantage something it hasn’t done the past few weeks.</p>\n<p>“We would like to finally be above .500 by the end of this weekend, it will be tough but it would be nice to have that momentum going forward,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on UTRGV for game one at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 6 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

</span><em>Alyssa Long / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But collecting this data involves a large amount of behind-the-scenes work to keep it running from decade to decade. To help students at UC Santa Barbara understand how the census works, U.S. Census Bureau Media Specialist Vanessa Moreno sat down with the Nexus to speak about how exactly collecting population data at UCSB and in I.V. works. Moreno specializes in dispelling misconceptions around the census and providing citizens a solid foundation for understanding how it works.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first U.S. Census was administered in 1790, and one has followed every 10 years since that time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The census also determines congressional apportionments for the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We allocate over $675 billion each year across the country for services … things that everyone’s going to use at one point or another. That’s why it’s really important to get a fair and accurate count of everyone,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of methods the U.S. Census Bureau employs to get an accurate count of the population, which depend on the living situation of those being counted. For those who live in residences such as houses or apartments, the occupants of each space are invited to respond to the census via the phone, mail or online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll send mail out invitation[s] to respond in mid-March. It’ll be a letter, and it will be addressed to the residence, not the residents, not the actual people living there,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, reminders will be sent to those who have not yet responded. If all else fails, an enumerator, a representative of the U.S. Census Bureau tasked with interviewing non-responses, will be sent to a residence in a last-ditch effort to obtain a proper count for the residence, according to Moreno. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get an accurate number of students living in residence halls or university apartments, the U.S. Census Bureau will instead contact the university directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Any students that live in the dorms or student apartments don’t have to take the census themselves because we [have] already contacted or we are contacting [university] administrators and asking them how many people live there,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who do not have a permanent residence, census enumerators must take a more active role in obtaining a count. First, Moreno said, representatives will be sent to service-based localities such as soup kitchens or homeless shelters, where they will contact those who head those services to obtain a count of people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After, she said the U.S. Census Bureau will have people go to other locations, such as freeway underpasses or encampments, and do a physical count of how many people live there over a three-day period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process takes months, and the results of the census are compiled and delivered to the president in December, with the results available to the public in early 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno also noted that those working with the U.S. Census Bureau must take an oath of confidentiality before carrying out any tasks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will never tell, for example, your landlord that you have more people living there than you should have. That’s not something we can or would do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take a lifetime oath to protect people’s information. And if we ever were to break that oath, we are subject to a $250,000 fine or five years in prison,” Moreno said. “So no one is too eager to break that oath.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno also addressed a point of controversy that has sparked criticism of the census in recent times. In </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/trump-census-citizenship-question.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Trump administration attempted to add a citizenship question to the census, but Moreno emphasized that the addition in question was struck down and will not be on the 2020 census.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no fear necessary when filling out the census,” Moreno said. “[People’s] information is safe and protected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because I.V. is a college town with residents who often move and may not be aware of how the census is carried out — or what relevance it has to their community— Moreno said there is some likelihood of an undercount.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno went over a number of risk factors that could lead to this outcome, including the tendency for parents to include their children as residents in their household while the children are actually living at college, as well as resident fears that information obtained by the U.S. Census Bureau will be used against them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequences of an undercount are significant, Moreno said, noting it can result in inaccurate apportionment in the House of Representatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is the risk of California losing a seat in Congress,” Moreno said, adding that impacts to federal funding could also be severe, depending on the magnitude of the undercount.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basically any social service that you can think of could be affected if people don’t make themselves count, and there’s no way to reassess the census once it’s been done until the next census,” Moreno said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is estimated that for every person that [isn’t counted] about $2,000 per year are lost from funding. Let’s say 100 people don’t answer. That’s like $200,000,” she said. “Then you multiply it by 10 years and it’s like $2 million.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
