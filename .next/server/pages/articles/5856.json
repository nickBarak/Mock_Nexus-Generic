It should be an encouraging sign for the politically inclined that any U.S. politician would be a household name in a country where we monitor the statements made by “Duck Dynasty” cast members more closely than those of our congressmen. However, the New York City-native is not famous for introducing meaningful legislation or for exercising political clout. Rather, Weiner was cemented into the American mind when, as I’m sure you remember, a lewd photo of the congressman appeared briefly on his Twitter account in 2011, sparking a scandal that spanned over two years and caused a media frenzy.</p>\n<p>While his original public position was that his account had been hacked as a prank, within weeks Weiner gave a tearful confession in which he admitted to engaging in “inappropriate online relationships” with a variety of women he had met on the Internet. The media grabbed ahold of the scandal immediately, and soon discussion about Weiner’s, well, “wiener,” was taking place on every major news network. Political journalists gleefully coined the term “Weinergate”and headlines following a “Insert-Your-Weiner-Pun-Here” formula crowded newsstands, particularly in New York where raking someone over the coals is practically an art form.</p>\n<p>By the time Weiner resigned from Congress on June 16, he was the talk of the nation. His woes only continued during an attempted return to politics in the 2013 race for mayor of New York. During the campaign, more pictures and messages were released and Weiner was thrust back into the spotlight. He officially dropped out of the race in June, and once again a grown man sending suggestive photographs to women became a national news story. Amongst all the excitement that accompanies scandals of such longevity, many Americans failed to ask themselves an important question: Why should we care? The simple answer is: we should not.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>We should not ignore such a scandal because Anthony Weiner deserves our sympathy or respect. Weiner is certainly a scumbag for cheating on his wife and embarrassing his family. You could make the case that he deserved to be dragged through the mud the way he was, but that does not mean we should confuse this type of frivolous gossip with actual news.</p>\n<p>While political analysts in suits discussed Anthony Weiner’s “dick pics,” an unprecedented income gap between the have’s and have-not’s continued to widen, powerful lobbies in Washington continued to control more aspects of legislature than anyone cares to admit and the NSA was collecting masses of private data on American citizens without their knowledge. The opaque world of politics is ripe with scandals that actually affect the American quality of life. By giving airtime to something as unimportant (on a national scale) as the infidelity of a public figure, we’re spending less time digging into these far more pressing issues. It is just another example of our growing preference for spending our time on what we want to hear rather than what we need to hear. The problem with this trend, this sensationalist, substance-less version of “news,” is that it trades our political discourse for tabloid fodder.</p>\n<p>To pass off the country’s fascination with this story as relevant because congressmen are supposed to be held to a high moral standard is laughable. Is “unfaithful” a description idealistically befitting of a congressman? Of course it’s not. But we as a people are either ignorant or lying to ourselves if we do not acknowledge that dishonesty and deception are traits for which politicians are naturally selected. The power struggle in Washington is a game in which politicians lie and cheat, and sometimes they’re going to get caught. Google “politician sex scandal” and look at the laundry list of familiar names. In fact, go check out what’s going on with France’s President Hollande at the moment — for the past week, his current extramarital affair has completely overshadowed his poor ratings. Is it really shocking that powerful, wealthy men who make a living on their appearance and ability to speak persuasively, stray from home? Is infidelity really where we want to draw the line for holding our politicians accountable? Is there nothing more substantive to investigate?</p>\n<p>Disguised as rightful indignation at the unfaithful actions of a congressman, the frenzy that accompanies a scandal like Weiner’s or Hollande’s is, in reality, driven by the same love for petty gossip that inspires high school drama. The whole thing, really, is inherently childish, from the tireless use of the ridiculous term “sexting,” to the way Republicans chomped at the bit to get in their digs at a partisan opponent. While the news was caught up in this adolescent natter, the secretive and often sinister world of politics hummed along, continuing to be largely ignored and misunderstood by those who couldn’t take the time to pay attention unless there were half-naked public figures involved.</p>\n<p>The only thing worth discussing about Anthony Weiner are his politics — they are the only relevant aspects of his life to the average American. If he is also an ass, that is unfortunate, but that doesn’t make it national news. If you follow politics independent of the occasional scandal, the “sexting” debacle is far from the first sign that Weiner is a total jerk. Prone to outbursts to and against the media, and often criticized as being more concerned with camera time and his mayoral aspirations than with passing meaningful legislation as a congressman, Weiner and his unfaithfulness seems almost a foregone conclusion. Yet we react with outraged indignation all around the country at the realization that an outwardly selfish and rude person did a selfish, rude thing.</p>\n<p>It would be excellent to live in a magical world where infidelity was the most egregious crime committed by a politician. Unfortunately, this is the least of our worries. As long as corruption and inequality plague the inner workings of our governing bodies, it would do us Americans well to be unsatisfied with a scandal of such little significance. Every time we allow ourselves to hear stories like the Weiner scandal and consider ourselves to be “following politics,” we play into the hand of individuals who benefit from our interest in the petty and personal, and from our ignorance of the greater injustices at play. The next time a story of this nature arises, we would be wise to put small distractions like Weiner’s wiener to the side and focus on much larger issues.</p>\n<p><em>Matthew Meyer is a second-year political science major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

Her internal conflict with whether or not she is the right person to embark on this voyage slightly justifies some of the slow pacing caused by the cliche used in the third act. Maui is the typical selfish character changed by the quest he takes with Moana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair follow the “hero’s journey” story without ever going through any noticeable changes in the end. Despite Moana and Maui fitting into known archetypes amongst other small problems, the voice acting and character animation for them is honestly what made me enjoy them way more than I thought.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the Heights” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda helmed the music for “Moana,” from including authentic Polynesian language to paying tribute to David Bowie. These songs help look into the character’s mentality or tell the story in musical form. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the very best, the songs can sweep audience members into the scene, sending chills down their spine with the bombastic instrumentals and vocals. “How Far I’ll Go” competes with “We Know the Way” as the best song of the film. This song is a more tame, slower version of “Let it Go,” that might rival it in regards to its quality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, most of the best songs are used in the beginning of the film leaving nothing as catchy by the end. But, even the songs that are not as good are still infectious in their own right. They just don’t have as big of a purpose in the film, fit with the tone of the film or aren’t as memorable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People have been claiming that Disney is possibly entering a second renaissance after the critical and financial failure of their films in the early 2000s, and “Moana” is another film that reinforces this idea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the film “Frozen” was merely a new reinterpretation of this same Disney formula, “Moana” is a vastly compelling execution of this story. While there were stereotypical plot points or characters, the film helped brighten up the plot with beautiful animation and fresh music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, “Moana”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have been another retread of an established, yet familiar, formula. In all honesty, isn’t that why we were excited for this film in the first place?</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74548\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/moana-is-a-vibrant-disney-masterpiece/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74548\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/moana-is-a-vibrant-disney-masterpiece/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/moana-is-a-vibrant-disney-masterpiece/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/moana-is-a-vibrant-disney-masterpiece/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/moana-is-a-vibrant-disney-masterpiece/","id":5853,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5852,5851,5850],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Keeping It Safe, Keeping It Local","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Housing-DAILY-NEXUS-FILE-PHOTO.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Housing-DAILY-NEXUS-FILE-PHOTO.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Christy Gross, a second-year psychology major, calls for a more Isla-Vista-centric approach to next year's Deltopia.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Fellow UCSB students,</p>\n<p>Do you know what your degree is worth?

We are not the trash can of Southern California, where people bus it here to get drunk and violent, trash our homes, assault our police and riot … because why? Because they can?</p>\n<p>Students at UC Davis and UC Berkley have been pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed just like us. But what were they protesting? Tuition raises and the UC Regents’ salary increases. What did we riot for on Saturday? The right to party.</p>\n<p>And six officers were injured on Saturday … It is <b>never</b> okay to assault a police officer. They aren’t trying to take away your right to party, they are trying to keep us safe. They’ve seen the past tragedies of students falling to their death from the cliffs, the overdoses, and the sexual assault victims. They are trying to protect you, and when a riot breaks out, they do what is necessary for the good of the people.</p>\n<p>Now is the time when we have to start working to turn this school around. A party school reputation isn’t all that bad when you have seven Nobel Prize winners on your staff and a collective student body made up of some of the most talented, intelligent and hard-working people in the county. But this increasingly violent reputation filled with stories of assaults against the police, gang rapes and stabbings … it has to end. Now.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to put the blame on out-of-towners coming to Isla Vista to live vicariously through the students who actually deserve to be here. It’s harder to realize that we are a part of the problem, ruining the worth of our degrees by letting half of our high school class crash on our floors for Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>That is why I am proposing that UCSB students, SBCC students, and the community of Isla Vista follow the ideology that A.S. promoted last Halloween: “Keep It Safe, Keep It Local.” You should be proud that you are a Gaucho, you should be proud that you deserve to be here, and you should be able to celebrate your successes with fellow Gauchos — let’s keep it that way.</p>\n<p>Gaucho Pride is so much more than doing the “Ole” chant at soccer games. Rather, Gaucho Pride should mean protecting our investments in our own educations. So, let’s all start getting our Gaucho Pride on; help me, and all of our current, future and past Gauchos, come up with new ways to keep our school-spirited holidays safe and local.</p>\n<p><em>Christy Gross is a second-year psychology major.</em></p>\n<h6>This is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.</h6>\n<h6>The views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB and are primarily submitted by students.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54702\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-08/keeping-it-safe-keeping-it-local/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54702\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-08/keeping-it-safe-keeping-it-local/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-08/keeping-it-safe-keeping-it-local/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-08/keeping-it-safe-keeping-it-local/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-08/keeping-it-safe-keeping-it-local/","id":5854,"author":{"id":449,"name":"Christy Gross"},"related":[5853,5852,5851],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Roe v.

Wade ruling, fourth-year Ali Jimenez argues that the fight for reproductive justice is still very much an ongoing battle.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As someone born after 1973, which was the year the Supreme Court legalized abortion in America, I’ve grown up in a country where women have the right to make their own reproductive decisions, but I don’t take this for granted. Our grandmothers and mothers fought so that I would be able to make my own decisions about my body. Growing up in the wake of Roe v. Wade has made me appreciate what my generation has and how essential it is to continue the fight for reproductive freedom. We are reminded of horror stories of illegal abortions obtained by women in the generations before us, a scary reality that we’ve never had to live. And as we honor the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the right to safe and legal abortion has never felt more important to me than it does now.</p>\n<p>There have been more legislative attacks on our reproductive freedoms in the last three years than in the entire previous decade. Using bogus claims of protecting “women’s health and safety,” politicians across the country have been chipping away at our reproductive rights, state by state. Since 2010 more than 200 restrictions on abortion access have become law, and 70 of these new restrictions have passed in 2013 alone. The result: More than half of women of reproductive age are living in states where access to abortion is being restricted by their state legislatures. Make no mistake: Safe and legal abortion is under attack.</p>\n<p>I adamantly oppose these unprecedented efforts to turn back the clock on women’s health, and I’m not alone. In fact, six in 10 young Americans believe abortion should be available in all or most cases, and 68 percent believe it should be available in their own community.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This fight isn’t about being “pro-choice” or “pro-life.” Those outdated labels don’t come close to defining who we are or the complexity of this issue. Instead of talking about what divides us, let’s talk about what we can agree on. What the majority of us do agree on is that these are decisions that should be left to a woman and her doctor.</p>\n<p>Reproductive freedom is not just about abortion; it’s interconnected with the spectrum of social justice issues we care about. It is impossible to discuss access to abortion without addressing poverty, racism, discrimination against immigrants and the range of issues that impact our ability to truly make the decisions that are best for ourselves, our families and our communities. Some of us have come to care about abortion through our passion for other issues like LGBTQ and immigrants’ rights. But regardless of how we entered this fight, we’re here to stay.</p>\n<p>Although we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us, it’s our responsibility to create a new reality for sexual and reproductive freedom. That’s why I am a leader in UCSB’s VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood chapter and part of the Planned Parenthood Generation, just one of the more than 200 campus groups across the country focused on harnessing the power, energy and enthusiasm of young people to fight for reproductive freedom and fundamental justice for all.</p>\n<p>As we look ahead to our ongoing fight against these attacks on women’s health care access across the country, we need your commitment. We know that in order for this fight to be successful it has to be not only interconnected with other social justice issues, but intergenerational. Help us make this generation the generation that puts an end to the attacks on safe and legal abortion once and for all.</p>\n<p>VOX meets Wednesdays at 8 p.m. at the SRB.</p>\n<p><em>Ali Jimenez is a fourth-year political science major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, January 22, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
