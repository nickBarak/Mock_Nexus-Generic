Morrow scored again in the eighth inning on a sacrifice fly from Woodward.

We had really quality relief from Hector Lujan and Greg Mahle.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue its schedule this Friday on the road in its first three-game series of the season against San Jose State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of Feb. 19th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54066\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/ucsb-opens-its-season-with-a-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54066\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/ucsb-opens-its-season-with-a-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/ucsb-opens-its-season-with-a-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/ucsb-opens-its-season-with-a-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/ucsb-opens-its-season-with-a-victory/","id":4690,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4689,4688,4687],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Pushing For The Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2632.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/markbrocher_baseball_4.19.2013_DSC_2632.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Heading into the season’s end, every game for the UCSB baseball team is incredibly important.

The sweep has left Davis with a 19-34 overall record and in last place in the Big West at 5-19.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, despite Tuesday’s loss, have been playing very well. Having won their last five weekend series against Big West opponents, they have climbed into a tie for fourth place at 31-23 and 14-10 in the Big West.

Cal Poly takes on a struggling Pacific team that was able to edge a win from UCSB last week, so if the Tigers can do the same this weekend, a sweep of Davis will set the Gauchos for a playoff chance.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will rely on the strength of their starting pitchers. In seven of the last nine games, UCSB starters have thrown quality starts, which is six innings of allowing just three earned runs or less. Tuesday’s starter, freshman Justin Jacome, just missed qualifying as he needed one more out. He still pitched five-and-two-thirds innings, allowing just two runs to UCLA.</p>\n<p>“Everything is going to stay the same,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We have had a lot of really good starts in a row going back with like six or seven quality starts in a row, so hopefully those guys continue to do that.”</p>\n<p>The weekend starters for the Gauchos have been stellar lately. Friday’s starter sophomore Austin Pettibone has thrown 17 innings over his last two starts and has allowed just two runs in that period.</p>\n<p>On the year, Pettibone sits with an 8-3 record and 3.00 ERA. He leads the Big West Conference with 102 innings pitched and is the only pitcher to have reached the 100 inning plateau so far this season.</p>\n<p>Through the struggles this season, Davis has had some players stand out this year. Sophomore designated hitter Nick Lynch ranks third in the Big West with a .361 batting average this season. Thanks to his high average and knack for getting hit by pitches, a Big West-high 20, Lynch is also third in the conference with an on-base percentage of .444.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outfielder Tino Lipson has scored the second-most runs for the Aggies with 30, thanks to his .340 batting average. Lipson also boasts an OBP of over .400. With runners aboard quite often, sophomore John Williams finds himself in very productive positions and ranks eighth in the Big West with his 38 RBI on the season.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Aggies have the highest batting average and the second-most runs scored in the Big West; however, the reason the team finds itself in the cellar of the conference is due to their inability to pitch effectively.</p>\n<p>The UC Davis pitching staff has given up the second-most hits, the second-most runs and allowed the most walks.

In just his second season as head coach, Andrew Checketts has guided his team into the playoffs. The Gauchos made a major push in the final two months of the regular season to capture a tie for second place in the Big West and earn a bid in the 64-team NCAA Baseball Championship.</p>\n<p>“This is kind of like a dream come true,” senior third baseman Marc Venning said. “I transferred from University of Arizona two years ago and they won the National Championship the year after I left, so I’ve had to live with that. I’ve always wanted a taste of Regionals, so this is like a dream come true and I wouldn’t go back and change this for anything.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, who enter the tournament at 34-23, received an at-large selection to participate in the Corvallis Regional hosted by the Pac-12 winner Oregon State, who finished the year 45-10. On the road in neutral ground, UCSB will take on Texas A&amp;M in the first game of the round.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We are just going to get ready to play like we would any other weekend and get ready for Texas A&amp;M,” Checketts said. “This should be fun because going up there is my alma mater and my boss Mark Massari’s last job was with Oregon State, so this should be a lot of fun; there is a lot of family up there.”</p>\n<p>At 32-27 and 13-16 in the SEC, the Aggies enter the regional as the second-seeded team behind Oregon State. The Gauchos are the third-seeded team above University of Texas at San Antonio from the Western Athletic Conference.</p>\n<p>The Regional will take place in double elimination format, with games ending June 3 before the Super Regional hosts are announced.</p>\n<p>The two teams head into this regional tournament riding very different ends to their seasons. The Gauchos have won their last six weekend series in a row with the last being a sweep of UC Davis to help push them into the postseason.</p>\n<p>The Aggies, however, scuffled with the end of their schedule losing five straight games from April 20-27. However, a 7-3 record in May gave them the final push they would need.</p>\n<p>Texas A&amp;M heads to Oregon having just played in their first ever SEC Tournament. The Aggies went 2-2 over their four games in Alabama, starting off hot with two wins, including one against No. 1 seeded Vanderbilt, but eventually dropped two in a row for elimination.</p>\n<p>The two teams are likely to throw their aces at one another to take game one of the tournament. That means UCSB will put sophomore starting pitcher Austin Pettibone on the bump. Pettibone has been the workhorse of the Gaucho staff and of the Big West conference. He has thrown 110 innings this season, the most in the Big West, and has a 9-3 record. The right hander has thrown at least eight innings in his last three starts.</p>\n<p>Texas A&amp;M is likely to throw sophomore Daniel Mengden on Friday. The right-hander from Houston holds an 8-4 record on the season with a 1.84 ERA in 15 starts this year. Mengden has thrown nearly 50 more innings than any other pitcher on the Aggies staff, as he too has cleared the 100 innings pitched plateau.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Aggies are set to kick off the Corvallis Regional with a noon game scheduled at Goss Stadium, the home of Oregon State in Corvallis. Following their game will be UT San Antonio and Oregon State at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version o this article appeared on page 1 of May 30, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.<br>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/ucsb-begins-journey-to-college-world-series/","id":4688,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4687,4686,4685],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Baseball Set to Build on Last Season’s Success","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After being selected to the NCAA Tournament last season, the UCSB baseball team hopes to further build on that success as the 2014 season opens this week.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Led by a core group of veterans and a talented crop of incoming players, the UCSB baseball team is focused on the bigger picture this year.

UCSB will rely on a deep pitching rotation that returns nine hurlers, including the entire rotation from 2013 and the backend of the bullpen.</p>\n<p>Despite the staff being without star junior pitcher Austin Pettibone for the first month of the season after he suffered a shoulder injury, UCSB has enough arms to make up for his absence. Looking to fill in the role will be sophomore pitcher Dylan Hecht, who moves from closer to the top of the team’s rotation.</p>\n<p>Last season, Hecht emerged as one of the top closers in the Big West. With a fastball that can reach 97 mph, Hecht earned nine saves and finished with a 1.83 ERA on his way to earning All-Big West honors. Joining Hecht in the rotation will be sophomores Justin Jacome and Robbie Nesovic; each are coming off solid freshman campaigns.</p>\n<p>“We’re really deep, there’s kind of no separation between some of our starters, our middle relief and closer,” Checketts said. “We’ve got some depth. We’re 10 to 12 deep, and they’re competitive.”</p>\n<p>Pitching wasn’t the only weapon in the Gauchos’ arsenal last season, as its offense was in the top three in most Big West offensive categories. Under hitting coach Jason Hawkins, the Gauchos were near the top in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage and home runs.</p>\n<p>Junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa appeared in all games for UCSB last season and led the team in hits, home runs, RBIs and slugging percentage. Kuresa will be joined by Nesovic who does double duty as a utility player. Nesovic ended last year’s campaign with a .326 batting average and 33 RBIs on his way to receiving Big West Freshman Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>With a similar approach on offense this year, the Gauchos will rely more on small ball to generate runs on the board rather than trying to hit for the fences.</p>\n<p>“We have a pretty solid lineup one through nine. We like to run and hit-and-run, we attempt to run a more West Coast Offense,” Checketts said. “I think you’ll see some [power] out of the middle of the order, but not an unbelievable amount.”</p>\n<p>The schedule will not be easy for the Gauchos who will be tested from the start.
