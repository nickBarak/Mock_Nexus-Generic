Scoring 63 points, the Gauchos had a strong offensive performance, shooting 41 percent from the field. UCSB is 5-0 when being the first to score 60 points or higher.</p>\n<p>“There is no way we’re overlooking anyone,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “I think with our record and some of the tough losses we’ve had this year, as a staff we [won’t] allow that to happen. I think our kids are smart enough to know we can’t do that.”</p>\n<p>For UCR, sophomore center Natasha Hadley and freshman guard Dynese Adams combined for 30 of the team’s 43 points. Junior forward Sweets Underwood led the Gauchos with 16 points.</p>\n<p>The most important key in that game, though, was rebounding. UCSB outrebounded UCR 45-26. The Gauchos feature two of the top six rebounders in the Big West in junior center Kirsten Tilleman and Underwood, who average 8.4 and 7.1 rebounds, respectively.</p>\n<p>“[I’m looking to be] aggressive, score, and stay on the boards,” Underwood said. “The offensive boards were really important for us in the last game and I think that’s my role, to focus on rebounding for us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will see a slightly different Highlander team, which was missing two starters: junior guards Tre’Shonti Nottingham and Leah Washington. Nottingham ranks fourth in the Big West in scoring (14.8), fifth in assists (3.5), and leads the conference in steals per game (3.3).</p>\n<p>While known for their defense, in the last two victories it looks like UCSB has finally pieced together their offense.</p>\n<p>“We’re executing our offenses a lot better,” Mitchell said. “We run a lot of things to start the game inside-out. When our posts make their shots early, [it] tends to open things up for our guards.”</p>\n<p>In their last game against CSU Bakersfield, both Gaucho posts, Underwood and Tilleman, tallied double-doubles. It was the second consecutive double-double for Tilleman.</p>\n<p>In addition, senior guard Emilie Johnson has found her offensive stride, finishing in double figures in six of the last seven games.</p>\n<p>“Every night, we’ve had different leadership and different scoring threats,” Mitchell said. “You look at Sweets and Tilleman on the scoring side of things and Emilie the last game. It can be a different player on any given night for us offensively.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. in Riverside.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44714\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/ucsb-extend-winning-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44714\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/ucsb-extend-winning-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/ucsb-extend-winning-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/ucsb-extend-winning-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-16/ucsb-extend-winning-streak/","id":753,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[752,751,750],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A Win at Home, and off on the Road Again","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"So after a nice week home and a win against Riverside on Saturday night, we’re back on the road for the next week basically.

The game against Riverside didn’t go exactly as I thought it would. We came out pretty flat and basically played like shit the first half, but we managed to put together a decent second half and were able to win, which is all that matters really. Now this road trip I don’t think anyone is looking forward to. We’re driving down Tuesday afternoon, playing Wednesday night and driving back to SB after the game Wednesday night only to get back on the bus Thursday around noon to drive back down to LAX for our flight to Utah where we’re playing Utah State on Saturday night for our bracket buster game. Get back on Sunday at some time and then on Tuesday we leave for Long Beach. So it’s gonna be a long week of playing good teams and sitting around the hotel doing jack shit. Can’t believe we have to go back to Utah. Only rThis eason I want to go to Utah is to snowboard. Provo was boring as hell and I don’t have very high expectations for Logan either. Why we are driving back to SB just to go back down to LA less than 12 hours later beats the hell outta me. I suppose it’s for the guys to go to class but let’s be honest here, who is going to attend class when we’re only home for a few hours. Probably only one player and that’s Boswell who’s a mechanical engineering major, so it’s understandable. On another note this is probably the nicest winter we’ve had in SB since I’ve been up here. Knock on wood and hope it continues because it never gets old. Enjoy it while you can because it’s not gonna last forever and it being my last few months here has made me appreciate Santa Barbara even more.

I asked them to come out focused. “</p>\n<p>Four players finished in double figures for the Gauchos in the third consecutive game in which UCSB has found successful offensive flow. Senior guard Emilie Johnson led team with 12 points, five rebounds, and five assists while Mason contributed 11. Junior forward Sweets Underwood and senior forward Kelsey Adrian finished with 10 apiece.</p>\n<p>“We’re much more confident, we’re getting a really good flow, and we’re knocking down shots when we’re open,” Mason said. “If [we] have four players in double figures, we’re going to win the games because we’re stopping people defensively.”</p>\n<p>Adrian, who has been held scoreless in two of the last three games, opened up the ball game with a three. Mason, who was playing in front of friends and family, followed in suit with another trey and the Gauchos quickly jumped out to a 14-4 lead.</p>\n<p>“This game, every time I shot, I thought, ‘this [is] going in’,” Mason said. “With my first shot, I was like, ‘this is it.’ I was very excited when it went it and it carried on throughout the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB, which is known for its slow starts, was red hot, opening up the game 4-6 from the field and 2-2 from downtown. At halftime, the Gauchos were shooting 41 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“We’re taking good shots,” Mitchell said. “Plus, we were pushing the ball in transition and getting layups is great for their confidence.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also stuck to their bread and butter, playing tremendous defense and holding UCR to 15.4 percent shooting in the first half. Their 12 first half points was the fourth lowest opponent total for a half in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p>“Our kids were on it,” Mitchell said. “Last game we gave up some early shots, so we worked on making all their looks contested shots. It was a total team effort in the first half.”</p>\n<p>UCSB didn’t miss a beat entering the second period and mounted an 11-0 run to bury UCR. However, the Highlanders generated a comeback and the Gauchos watched a 21 point lead diminish to just 10.</p>\n<p>“When we’re up 21, we can’t let them up back in the game,” Mason said. “If it was a better team, they would’ve taken advantage of that. We can’t be content, and I think we got a little content.”</p>\n<p>While Mason kept Riverside’s star, junior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham, in check in the first half with just three points, she finished with 16. Although she only shot 3-13, she made 9-10 from the line.</p>\n<p>“[Stopping Nottingham early] was the number one key to the game,” Mason said. “That was the only thing I was thinking about. I knew she liked to get to the basket so I wanted to make sure she didn’t get to the basket. Also, I think we did great team wise because the guards were great with helping.”</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a road game against UC Irvine Saturday. The Gauchos will seek revenge after a poor showing in the last match-up, a 61-53 loss.</p>\n<p>“They’re extremely athletic and I think our team will remember what they did to us last game,” Mitchell said. “They’re in the middle of the pack, so we’re going to have to have a more complete effort. We can’t have those let downs late the game.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 4 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-17/gauchos-beat-riverside-straight-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-17/gauchos-beat-riverside-straight-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-17/gauchos-beat-riverside-straight-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-17/gauchos-beat-riverside-straight-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-17/gauchos-beat-riverside-straight-wins/","id":751,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[750,749,748],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Offense Overpowers UC Irvine 85-62 Away From Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sophomore guard Kyle Boswell put up a career-high 19 points and made five three-point baskets to help the Gauchos beat UC Irvine on the road Wednesday night.
