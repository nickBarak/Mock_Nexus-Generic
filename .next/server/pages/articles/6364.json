Tinder is the stage on which you perform your grueling mating dance, and the sole audience member is you, clapping maniacally like Shia Labeouf.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re reading about this massage because it was one of the most transformative experiences of my life so far.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For about an hour I digitally peacocked and scoured through matches. Sometimes people get straight to the point. They’ll ask you what you’re looking for on Tinder. Shamelessly, I had no good reason for being on this app: I had no end goal, no desire to fulfill an emotional or physical void, no interest in meeting the father of my future children. I was here to waste time. My bio? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I like butter, meat, and your sense of humor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this glorious lowest common denominator bio I let it be known that I’m here to practice conversation and jab daintily at fragile masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me be your manic pixie meme girl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come across a particular guy who checks off my three boxes: He </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1) hasn’t call me a bitch yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) made an appropriate use of the sprout emoji. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3) looks like he hasn’t shaved since the last presidential election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looks like we have a winner! Let’s call him Brian. Brian and I meet up on DP for a stroll; it’s Deltopia and the happiness in the air is palpable (read: DP smelled like the devil’s lettuce). Brian tells me about his nerdy science stuff, makes very intentional eye contact as he tells me about his mission to cure cancer and save millions of lives, and tells me about his sweet family from North Carolina. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After we walk the length of DP, he asked me if I’d like a massage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me be clear: if a stranger offers you a massage, you should probably take all necessary precautions and evaluate the risk vs. reward. Ask yourself the important questions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How good are you at martial arts? Do you have pepper spray? Could you overpower this potential attacker? Do you have a loyal dog who could accompany you? Do his hands even look strong enough to knead out the decades of trauma in your shoulders? Once you’ve jumped through those hoops, you can say yes to the massage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re reading about this massage because it was one of the most transformative experiences of my life so far. I say “so far” because I’m not rich enough to dabble in Scientology yet. But I think I got a taste of what Tom Cruise probably feels like every day. I felt rebirthed: my arms became wings, I was given a new spine, every knot in my entire back from years of self-inflicted stress melted away. He whipped out an industrial sized bottle of organic lemon hemp lotion and pumped handfuls of the goop into his palms, slathering it across my shoulders. The lotion felt like mayo on my skin. I didn’t care. I wish he owned a pillow but who was I to complain? I should probably buy him a pillow for his service. I gained back four years of my life that day.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>These days, before you go swiping recklessly left and right, maybe it’s time to recognize that there are more creative ways to use Tinder.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He didn’t even want a massage in return, probably because my fingers look about as strong as vermicelli. A week later, I developed a weird rash on my back from the lotion, but to me they were only a sweet reminder of a glorious, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> massage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, before you go swiping recklessly left and right, maybe it’s time to recognize that there are more creative ways to use Tinder. Most of us download dating apps to satisfy our personal needs for emotional or sexual gratification, to either meet friends or flings or future partners; until Deltopia weekend, I thought these were the only benefits to be reaped from this embarrassing app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should consider accepting a massage. You could ask for one if it wasn’t offered. You should consider giving someone a massage. A massage culture would bring a whole new meaning to “I Gaucho back.”  Maybe the massage will be so good you’ll want it to be more than a massage. Maybe, in the year 2045, the notion of being a good kisser will give way to the importance of giving great massages. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matching with Brian’s massage skills was a stroke of serendipity: I know that not everyone will have the same luck I did. You might find an amateur who has not learned the full potential of his opposable thumbs; you may encounter a deviant who does little tickly motions that haunt you for weeks to come; you could even bump into a lazy boy who massages you for only a fleeting moment before complaining. Or maybe, just maybe, you’ll match with Brian. </span></p>\n<p><em>Katherine Chen wants to open people’s eyes to a new way of using Tinder.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.

This fine Wednesday, we’ve been lucky enough to have some of your peers sacrifice themselves on the altar of anonymous shame. It’s time for some sexual bloopers …</p>\n<p>“So I was having sex with this guy, and we were both pretty high. He happened to have silk sheets. While I was riding on top of him, my hands slipped and I fell, onto his face, headbutting him and inducing a massive nosebleed. Super cute.” —Shannon, second-year.</p>\n<p>“I was doing this girl from behind in the shower and got a little too enthusiastic: She ended up doing a somersault in the shower. Whoops.” —Kavon, third-year.</p>\n<p>“I had sex with a guy who held me up off of the ground, so I was totally reliant on his arm strength. When he came, he dropped me. He made up for it by giving me head after.” —Kathy, fourth-year.</p>\n<p>“I was having sex with this guy, and he legitimately bit my clit. I yelped, slapped his head away and snapped my legs closed, asking him if he would like it if I bit his dick. Seriously. Who thinks that’s going to feel good?” —Buttercup, fourth-year.</p>\n<p>“One time during my freshman year, I was with my boy at the dorms. We had the room to ourselves and were getting it on when we playfully rolled to the side on my lofted bed. He actually rolled off and landed face first on the floor six feet below! It was so funny to me that I couldn’t stop laughing, and it totally killed the mood. He even made this ‘Whoops!’ sound when he fell off.” —Yolanda, fourth-year.</p>\n<p>“One weekend, I had had a few too many shots and blacked out. I came to only to find my finger up an out-of-towner’s butt. The next day he told me no one had ever tried that with him before, and it was his new favorite thing. I was mortified, but I suppose it turned out to be a good thing.” —Mildred, fourth-year.</p>\n<p>“So my boyfriend at the time and I were in Vegas for a trip with friends, and we got a little too frisky. We were lounging in the pool when we decided to get it on … right there in the pool. So we drifted over to the manmade waterfall and started doing it underneath. We thought we were really sneaky. However, minutes later, the lifeguard came up to us and asked us to stop, embarrassed. ‘There are kids here,’ he said. We apologized and resolved to be a little more stealthy next time. Unfortunately everyone definitely knew what we were up to.” —Mariposa, third-year.</p>\n<p>“I knew a couple who were insistent on trying everything once. One time, the girl insisted they try anal sex in the heat of the moment with no real prior discussion on the subject. They knew they’d need lots of lube but because it was a spur of the moment decision, the only lube they had was chocolate flavored. It was their first and only time trying anal, and they used chocolate lube.” —Eli, fourth-year.</p>\n<p>“It was freshman year, and I was living in FT and I, of course, made the rookie mistake of hooking up with somebody on my floor. But how could I resist? He was so close and convenient. We had just finished. I was sitting on his bed, and I bent down to retrieve my clothes from the floor. It was dark, and I bumped my head on the corner of the wooden bedpost. It didn’t hurt that bad, so I figured it was just a bump. Well, he turned around with the most shocked look on his face and quickly handed me a paper towel. I pressed it to my forehead and realized that I was, in fact, gushing blood. There I was, sitting naked on his bed, forehead bleeding. As I held the paper towel on my cut, he attempted to help me get dressed. As soon as I was decent, I quickly retreated to my room where my drunk suitemates were waiting. At the sight of my forehead, they freaked out and called the injury to the attention of my entire floor. We came to a consensus that a trip to the hospital was needed, and I ended up with five stitches on my left eyebrow. Trying to explain to the nurse what happened was awkward to say the least.” —Delilah, second-year.</p>\n<p>“When I was still in high school, my ex-boyfriend and I were doing a theater show together. One day we stayed late after school and decided we wanted to do it on the set. While going at it, face-to-face with my legs thrown over his and sitting up, the sixth-grade class came into the room. Luckily we were wearing most of our clothes, so I just hugged him very tightly and cried, ‘We’re just hugging!’ It was so humiliating.” —Margo, second-year.</p>\n<p>“I grew up in Solvang. One night, my girlfriend and I had smoked up in my car on the side of the road before we started boning. In the middle of it all, we suddenly heard a knock on the window. The guy disturbing us was the most small-town cop you could imagine, and he was ready to punish us. He made us both get out of the car, her wearing only my shirt, me wearing only my boxers. He made us stand there for two hours while he called both of our parents (we were 16) to come and get us. This was especially bad as her parents were super conservative and religious: They didn’t know their baby girl was having sex or smoking weed. To top it all off, a group of people from the house up the hill having a party drove down to witness our embarrassment. I had to go in front of a judge, but that wasn’t the worst part. The worst part was getting dressed up in a suit and going to plead my case to her parents.” —Iglesias, third-year.</p>\n<p>Wham, bam, no thank you, ma’am — these are all wince-worthy. The Great Gaucho is pleased by your sacrifices. I am even more in love with my job now that you brave souls have sent these in.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In today’s world, sleeping with someone on the first night isn’t exactly taboo. While there are still stigmas and judgments surrounding it, casually sleeping with someone right after meeting them is viewed by many as nothing more than harmless fun. For the most part, our generation has chosen to embrace and celebrate our sexuality rather than feel ashamed of it. However, some people still choose to maintain old-fashioned and modest views when it comes to sex.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a both guy- and girlfriends who believe that sex is great but simply aren’t willing to give it up on the first night. For them, sex contains many more strings than not, and comfortability is a huge factor. In reality, sex does require a certain level of security and comfort, and some people just naturally possess more of that than others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, while it may not seem like a big deal for many of us, casual sex can definitely have some not-so-casual consequences. From STIs to unwanted pregnancies, there is definitely an element of risk when it comes to sex. Considering these very real possibilities, it makes a lot of sense as to why some people hesitate before jumping into bed with someone who is practically a stranger. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, the way I feel about sex on the first night can be summed up with: to each their own. Some people are comfortable enough to partake in the thrill every weekend, some are a bit choosier and others refuse to take the bait. In my opinion, as long as you’re responsible and standing by your convictions, there’s no wrong answer.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>I even have a friend who was mid-makeout with some guy in a bathroom at a party, and when she said, “I’m not going to have sex with you in this bathroom,” he literally stopped, said “okay” and walked out the door.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, I think a lot of people, especially girls, feel a certain amount of pressure to conform to the hookup culture that we have here in I.V. Everyone here is surrounded by incredibly attractive and charming people. Everyone here is surrounded by options. Everyone here is surrounded by competition. Because of this, I think a lot of girls feel the need to give into a game that they really don’t want to play. And the truth is, no one should be making decisions about their body or sexuality based off of the fear that they will be tossed aside for someone else.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until recently I hadn’t realized how often this happens. It’s hard for me to believe that anyone could so blatantly disregard someone that they’ve just met, simply because they find out that they won’t be getting into their pants just hours after learning each other’s names. The fact that people even have the audacity to do such a thing is pretty shocking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know girls who have spent whole evening with guys, where they danced, kissed and had a great time, only to be completely dropped the second that they let it be known that sex wasn’t an option. I even have a friend who was mid-makeout with some guy in a bathroom at a party, and when she said, “I’m not going to have sex with you in this bathroom,” he literally stopped, said “okay” and walked out the door. She didn’t even give a complete rejection; she simply specified that she wouldn’t do it IN THE DAMN BATHROOM. At first, I thought it was an ego problem. I assumed that these guys were just arrogant, misguided, spoiled idiots with some sort of disturbing god complex. In reality, I think it’s actually the exact opposite.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a girl tells you that she’s not comfortable having sex the first night you’ve met, and you choose to respond in such a disgusting and disrespectful way, all that shows is how insecure you really are. It doesn’t make you look cool, desired or confident; it makes you look like a coward. Running at the slightest sign of rejection or effort literally shows how little self-esteem you must possess, and it’s somewhat laughable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are hundreds of girls in this town who will gladly sleep with guys on the first night, and if that’s what you’re looking for, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, reacting in such an immature and embarrassingly chauvinistic way is not an appropriate response when you run into someone who happens to have different intentions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has differing views and opinions when it comes to sex. However, one thing that everyone should agree upon is that no matter how you choose to go about it, respect is always involved, no matter what the circumstances. On top of that, I guarantee that making a girl (or guy in some cases) feel comfortable and respected will get you a whole lot farther in the bedroom than spinelessly attempting to manipulate or pressure your way into someone’s pants. Sex is supposed to be sexy, and coercion is not sexy. So if that’s your go-to tactic for maintaining your sex life, chance is you aren’t either.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos wants you to have your sex with a healthy helping of respect. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/","id":6362,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6361,6360,6359],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Quel Your Horn With Porn:  The Merits of Spending Some “Me Time” in Cyberspace","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"To begin, I like porn.

As your dedicated Humptress, it is my duty to divulge this to you. You may now sigh in relief. You are now either more holy than I and abstain or one of my brethren. What a cozy atmosphere we’ve established for ourselves. Porn is very interesting because it varies so greatly between individuals. And it is highly taboo in its nature, of course. More than once I have casually brought it up to my friends and more often than not, they get this peculiar halting look, like, “Oh, wait, you just hit the sharing wall.” NAY. I say we’re going to Kool-Aid Man that wall up in dis bitch! I’m going to rant to you on why porn rocks and why you should chill out and swallow all of these deep-seeded worries you have buried inside of you (hehe).</p>\n<p>I think porn is the most personal thing people have in relation to their sexual life. Perhaps this is due to the fact that they are not really getting any, but are instead indulging their base desires in secret. Heaven forbid people see what you do in secret. It’s so often associated with deviant behavior. Let’s amend that. It’s just another form of kink, especially if you and an adventurous partner want to have your own personal viewing session.<br>\nMany girls seem uncomfortable with porn, which is silly. Maybe this is due to a lack of female advertising on porn websites, among other things. We know that most every guy out there has a substantial porn folder on their computer, hidden under something like, “Dull Trip to Kansas, Totally Not Worth Opening.” I think girls are more worried about what other girls will think, which is also dumb. I personally would rather engage in some scintillating media than have the pristine approval of women everywhere.<br>\nIt’s important to realize that the porn does not easily translate to the real world. Don’t treat your partner like she’s a pornstar. She will not thank you when you decide you want to copy the bukakke video you were watching last night just because the pornstar seemed enthused. It’s a lie. However, ladies, if you indulge in porn from time to time, it can be a valuable asset in your sex life. If you do decide to emulate things you see in porn, it often goes very well. His eyes will bug out, glazed and delighted, as he flashes back to the vigorous fapping he indulged in the night prior. “Hot damn, she knows what she’s doing,” he will think, in much fewer words (signified by “guh-huuuuuhh”).<br>\nIf you are comfortable and you have a regular partner, I think it would be healthy to tell them about your preferences, especially if you think it will open doors to things you want to try together. This does not apply to everyone. The type of porn some people watch is not reflective of what they would actually like to do. There is no freaking way I want to try many of the things I have encountered in my porn viewing. So don’t judge yourself or others based on the weird shit they watch. The more you watch and dabble, the more you find out what you like. Naturally, there are some types of porn that deserve thorough judging, which I feel I don’t need to describe.<br>\nIt’s fun.<br>\nI like to think of porn as literature for sex. If you want to learn how to do the Macarena, you look up a YouTube video. If you want to learn how to twerk while on top, you watch porn. It’s academic, goddammit.<br>\nSometimes you hit a dry spell. Instead of becoming a born-again virgin due to a lack of suitors, hit up those naughty pop-ups.<br>\nAs I’ve said before, I don’t think you should be afraid of sex or your sexuality. So just try it out. I’m not saying abandon real-life sex for your Internet mistress, Betsy Onnerback, but simply familiarize yourself with the different types of sex and sexual interests that are out there. Ultimately, go get ideas, get comfortable, but don’t get a lifestyle.</p>\n<p>As you know, my little chickadees, I like to assign you all homework. One night this week, I encourage you to schedule some “me time.” I recommend any of the following websites: pornhub.com, tube8.com, or fucd.com (for the entire compilation of every type of individual interest). Now go, you little horny toads! Play a little pocket pool to NC-17 material.
