The project will aid the existing trees as well as plant 30 more.<em> Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Edible Campus Program will begin the restoration of the overgrown Sueno Orchard with a group of volunteers on Oct. 16.</p>\n<p>The Sueno Orchard, a project that developed in the 1980s, lives on 6723 Sueno Road and used to house a vast array of different fruit trees, from guava to mulberry, some of which are still present in the orchard today.</p>\n<p>According to Rodney Gould, Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) general manager, the group has been mulling over the project for the past three years, as community voices clamored for restoration of the orchard each year.</p>\n<p>The feat was delayed due to insufficient funds, Gould said, and residents redirected their efforts to other community projects following the May 2014 Isla Vista shooting.</p>\n<p>Now, the process seems to be on the path to fruition as IVRPD drafts proposals for the reinstallation of a drip irrigation system, the planting of new trees and care of existing trees.</p>\n<p>“We’re fulfilling a vision that has been requested for a few years here,” Gould said. He said recent community input indicated that the restoration process was still a pertinent issue for the residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Gould, the orchard has fallen into disarray over the years.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Peace Course, a professional disc golf association, has two holes on orchard grounds, and flying disc sports have caused damage to some of the trees’ trunks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the removal of the drip irrigation system and a statewide drought have also contributed to a number of the fruit trees’ untimely deaths.</p>\n<p>Gould emphasized the main goals of the restoration effort: to put in drip irrigation and to plant 30 new trees while saving the eight healthy trees that are already on the orchard grounds.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are mulberry, citrus, apple and guava trees on the grounds of the orchard, and the project will plant more of those trees and other native species.</p>\n<p>Gould said IVRPD is drafting grant proposals and looking for student groups that will help provide funds. IVRPD will also be looking for volunteers to help on their initial cleanup day.</p>\n<p>Additional aid will come from the Santa Barbara Public Works Department in the form of fruit tree donations. Recently, the Southern California Edison Electric Company removed a few trees from different parcels along the road during road work.</p>\n<p>Afterward, the Public Works Department contacted Gould and inquired whether they could plant trees in other I.V. parks as mitigation for the removed trees.</p>\n<p>Gould instead asked for fruit trees for the burgeoning orchard. The Public Works Department will now give IVRPD between five to seven trees in exchange, he said.</p>\n<p>According to Gould, the UCSB Sustainability Program has been instrumental in raising campus and community awareness, and program coordinator Katie Maynard will be providing volunteers for the Oct. 16 cleanup day.</p>\n<p>The volunteers will be doing light trimming of the existing trees and will help build wells around those trees so that they don’t retain water while they are being watered.</p>\n<p>After the cleanup day, the process will continue with the installation of the irrigation system and the planting of the new trees. Gould said organizers hope to install irrigation prior to the middle of November and to install trees by late November.</p>\n<p>“People definitely utilize what’s there; people who have graduated also come back to Isla Vista and harvest the fruit,” Gould said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/seeds-sown-for-sueno-orchard/","id":4643,"author":{"id":248,"name":"Persi Zamani"},"related":[4642,4641,4640],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":248,"name":"Persi Zamani","biography":"Not available","articles":[4643],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Witnesses Allege Misconduct Concerning Recent Student Death","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"**This story will be updated as more information becomes available.** A previously published Daily Nexus article regarding IVFP’s account of Andres Esteban Sanchez’s death can be found u...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong><em>**This story will be updated as more information becomes available.**</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>A previously published </em>Daily Nexus<em> article regarding IVFP’s account of Andres Esteban Sanchez’s death can be found under <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/ucsb-student-andres-esteban-sanchez-passed-away-sunday-night/\">“UCSB Student Andres Esteban Sanchez Passes Away Sunday Morning</a></em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/ucsb-student-andres-esteban-sanchez-passed-away-sunday-night/\"><em>.”</em></a></p>\n<p>Five students spoke during public forum at the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate meeting on Wednesday night to give witness testimonials of the events leading up to the death of second-year pre-biology major Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez on Sunday, Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4:40 a.m., two Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies responded to reports of a male subject on the 6700 block of Abrego Road running in the street screaming for help. Upon arrival, deputies were flagged down by a nearby witness who stated the male subject, later identified as UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez, had a deep laceration on his right arm.</p>\n<p>The five students, Areli Ariana, Ashley Baker, Jocelin Hernandez, Alejandra Melgoza and Marvin Ramirez, dialed 911 following an encounter with Sanchez near their residence. According to the students, first responders on the scene mishandled the situation, mistreating the victim and witnesses based on their race.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College student Marvin Ramirez said Sanchez ran up to him and Hernandez screaming “help!” while bleeding profusely from his right arm.</p>\n<p>“He, like, ran into my arms and I didn’t even have a shirt on, and I felt him and he had a massive cut in his right arm and it was just gushing out blood, and it wasn’t dripping, it was literally flying and it was ridiculous,” Ramirez said. “I knew at the time that it was a matter of time, and we ran inside and tried to get a towel and we tried to take care of him.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Sanchez was restless but was not violent toward the five witnesses.</p>\n<p>“He was a little bit out of control due to the adrenaline, so he was running around from one apartment complex to another, but we attempted to stop him. We sat him down several times,” Ramirez said. “Though it seemed like he was violent, he didn’t do anything to us.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza said she spoke with dispatch and “specifically requested” medical assistance, but was not taken seriously.</p>\n<p>“I was the one who called dispatch and dispatch didn’t believe me,” Melgoza said. “When you have anyone who is pleading for help, saying that there is blood gushing out of a wound — when you have someone who is passed out in front of your doorstep with blood gushing out of a wound, I would expect dispatch to hear the screaming in the background.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year comparative literature and psychology double-major Areli Ariana said EMTs and paramedics who responded to the call displayed a lack of urgency.</p>\n<p>“They literally acted like it was an inconvenience for them to do their job,” Ariana said. “We were yelling at them, and yes we were frantic, but who wouldn’t be if they were covered in blood.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, emergency personnel took a long time to arrive, and police officers and firefighters did not act urgently upon arriving at the scene.</p>\n<p>“I was jumping in front of them and just full of blood and telling them to hurry up and they just walked out of the car,” Ramirez said. “When the firefighters got there they didn’t want to get blood on their suit, and I remember Jocelin screaming at them, ‘If I have blood on me, why can’t you get blood on you! Hurry up, we don’t have time!’”</p>\n<p>Ariana said responders disregarded her and other witnesses’ attempts to explain the situation, but acknowledged a white male bystander who began speaking to them after police arrived.</p>\n<p>“We’re all basically persons of color; there’s no doubt that we’re brown. He just completely bypassed everything we said,” Ariana said. “He didn’t acknowledge our presence — he didn’t recognize us. From the moment we started speaking he ignored us.”</p>\n<p>According to Ariana, the deputies who responded treated Sanchez “brutally” without reason.</p>\n<p>“While Jocelin and I were huddled over Andy, we were able to hold him down and to calm him down while the police officers came,” Ariana said. “When the police officers came, the first thing they did was to grab a baton and try to hold Andy down.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year film and media studies major Ashley Baker said the police officers involved in Sunday night’s incident were not held accountable for their “brutal” treatment of Sanchez.</p>\n<p>“This is the third time in my life that I have witnessed one of my Latino brothers pass away and have it be completely erased the next morning,” Baker said. “Instead of having a thorough investigation they wash everything down. It was like a Hazmat — it  was like it never happened.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, the officer did not have an emergency kit and approached the scene with a baton in hand.</p>\n<p>“One of the other things was that the cop didn’t have an emergency kit, so when they got out they just got out with a baton. What good are you by then?” Ramirez said. “We asked why, and they just said the car did not have it on them. That’s not an excuse because we lost a life, and you don’t know how important that is but that’s a life, a student life.”</p>\n<p>Ariana said Sanchez’s death is likely due to first responders’ misconduct.</p>\n<p>“This is a fellow student of ours who probably died because of the negligence of the EMTs and the paramedics and the police officers,” Ariana said.</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Sanchez’s mother was unaware of the situation the next day due to an incomplete police report, in which the witnesses who called emergency services were not included.</p>\n<p>“You don’t understand how hard it was,” Ramirez said. “And how hard it was for the mother when we saw her the next day and she had no idea about what happened because they didn’t take a thorough report and they didn’t include us in the report.”</p>\n<p>Ariana said IVFP did not have translation services available, which delayed the time it took to notify Sanchez’s family of his death.</p>\n<p>“We found out that his family didn’t speak English, so they needed a translator,” Ariana said. “He [the officer] was very insensitive to that and he did not prioritize communicating the sensitive information to Andy’s family.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza also said emergency responders should have access to translation, especially to Spanish.</p>\n<p>“How many Latino/Latina families are out in Isla Vista?” Melgoza said. “The fact that we don’t have translating services is a disgrace.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez said she wants to stress the “racial dynamics and dimensions” of the law enforcement’s failure to address the situation.</p>\n<p>“It looks like two cops running in and trying to restrain the individual. And they criminalized the individual because they don’t know how to react,” Hernandez said. “They recoiled at the sight of the wound because they’re not trained, that is not somebody that is trained to ensure our safety.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, the police officers did not carry out their responsibility to ensure Sanchez’s well-being.</p>\n<p>“This is a student that meant nothing to us, I’m not even getting paid to care,” Ramirez said. “If we have such urgency why don’t they do everything in their power?”</p>\n<p><em>For the IVFP response: <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">“IVFP Responds to Allegations of Misconduct in Sanchez’s Death.”</a></em></p>\n<p><em>For the SBC Fire response:</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/</a></p>\n<p><em>The </em>Nexus<em> firmly believes in fair comment and is actively seeking comment from all agencies involved in these allegations.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus. <em>The title of this article was edited to better reflect the context in which the statements were delivered. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/","id":4640,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4639,4638,4637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Goings-On in I.V.

The last day to register is Oct. 24.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-upcoming-week/","id":4641,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4640,4639,4638],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Launch Held for New I.V.

At Saturday’s launch event, participants shared ideas and recommendations for the community center’s role and services. The center is set to be complete spring 2017.</p>\n<p>According to Farr, I.V. residents are “extremely enthusiastic” about the project.</p>\n<p>“They have formed committees to work on different aspects of it,” Farr said. “We are certainly encouraging their participation and input into all faces of it. My mantra has just been that we really want to keep the project moving forward and as on budget and on time as possible.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs Paola Dela Cruz said the community center launched after decades of inactivity due to support from the county.</p>\n<p>“I think [the community center] has to do with the opportunity that the county has given us to actually own — for the community to own — this building,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz also said another reason for the project’s increased momentum is a community response to challenges I.V. has recently faced.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, I think it also has to do with other events that have happened in our community which have raised awareness about the issues that we have here,” Dela Cruz said. “We do need county resources, we do need the university to invest money, we do need residents to take ownership.”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Sue Whisenand said she hopes I.V. residents of all ages and backgrounds use the community center for a variety of purposes.</p>\n<p>“For me, I see it being multigenerational,” Whisenand said. “I see it being a place where we have food events that help with building good nutrition and eating habits, and I see places where we can have different shows, and I see a pleasant place where maybe there are some parenting classes.”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Bonnie Murdock also said she wants the center to serve all I.V. communities.</p>\n<p>“I envision it as a location for flexible activities where various groups can request use of the building, and I hope it is used for residents, students and all age groups,” Murdock said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she was happy to see people come together to celebrate the project’s launch and show interest in its progress.</p>\n<p>“I’m so glad to see that throughout this process different communities have been able to come together and to talk,” Dela Cruz said. “At the beginning I think it is difficult because we all have different ideas and perspectives … but it’s nice to just see, look at this, we did it together.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65548\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/launch-held-for-new-i-v-community-center-set-to-open-2017/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65548\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/launch-held-for-new-i-v-community-center-set-to-open-2017/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/launch-held-for-new-i-v-community-center-set-to-open-2017/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/launch-held-for-new-i-v-community-center-set-to-open-2017/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/launch-held-for-new-i-v-community-center-set-to-open-2017/","id":4642,"author":{"id":115,"name":"Sierra Deak"},"related":[4641,4640,4639],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
