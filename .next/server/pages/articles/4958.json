The Gauchos now sit atop Long Beach, UC Davis and CSUN, the three teams Santa Barbara has beaten during the team’s current win streak.</p>\n<p>Just a little over a week ago, UCSB was in a very different place. The Gauchos were coming off of a 3-1 thrashing at the hands of Cal Poly for their fourth loss in a row, and were staring up at the majority of the Big West.</p>\n<p>That feels so long ago now.</p>\n<p>“We’re just continuing to improve,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said after the match against CSUN. “We’re getting better, and we also got a couple players back that were out, so we had to deal with a lot of adversity.”</p>\n<p>In what should be a surprise to no one who has paid attention to the Gauchos this year, outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins was UCSB’s premier attacker in both of the weekend’s matches. The redshirt sophomore had 27 kills against Long Beach State and another 20 against CSUN, both team-highs.</p>\n<p>“(Lindsey) has been spectacular all week,” Lantagne Welch said. “We ask her to do a lot, and she really gave us a lot. She’s getting better at seeing the block and making really good choices, and it’s fun to see that evolve.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s stellar weekend went deeper than just Ruddins, however. Freshman Nicole Omwanghe put up a strong performance in both matches, in different aspects of the game. Omwanghe notched 11 kills, second-best on the team, against Long Beach and tied for first with seven total blocks against Northridge.</p>\n<p>Setter Annie Hasselmann was the other Gauchos with seven blocks on Saturday night, but her game was diverse as well. Hasselmann orchestrated the UCSB offense all match with 28 kills, one match after racking up a career-high 47 against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>As a whole, however, Welch wasn’t thrilled with her team’s passing even despite the successful results.</p>\n<p>“Our passing was not very good,” Lantagne Welch said. “I’m not (going to) sugarcoat it, we didn’t pass well but we actually passed better here than we did in (CSUN’s) gym because offensively we were able to sustain it.”</p>\n<p>Welch might not have liked how her charges passed, but it certainly didn’t seem to affect the Gauchos too negatively.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against Long Beach State was mostly a close battle throughout. UCSB battled back from an early deficit to take the first set, blew a small lead in the second set, and then led for the majority of both the third and fourth sets.</p>\n<p>The match against CSUN was a similar mix of drama and ease for the Gauchos, who won the first set with minimal worry. A victory in the second set, however, took an extended comeback from UCSB, who at one point trailed 17-9 and later 22-18.</p>\n<p>Welch’s worries about her team’s passing aside, the Gauchos looked like a team reborn over the weekend, something that they’ll look to continue into the future. UCSB is staring at a difficult slate of upcoming games, as they’ll take on Hawaii, then Cal Poly and finally UC Irvine in the next two weeks. Those three teams are the best of the Big West, and will serve as a major test of the Gauchos’ improvement.</p>\n<p>First up are the Rainbow Warriors, who will travel to Santa Barbara on October 28. The two teams will meet at Rob Gym at 5 p.m., due to the Halloween Delirium concert that night in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Cal Poly is returning to the AVCA National Top 25 for the first time since 2008, when the Mustangs were No. 22.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The visitors will enter the Thunderdome as winners of their last 11 consecutive games, including wins over then No. 20 Wichita State and defending Big West champion Hawai’i.</p>\n<p>Things are not quite as favorable on the Gaucho side of the equation as UCSB lost its last three matches in addition to having already lost nine of its last 10 sets played.<br>\nSanta Barbara will look to bounce back from being swept in four of its last five contests. Even with such results, the season is far from over.</p>\n<p>Two wins against UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton to open up Big West play gave the Gauchos a bit of a cushion to afford to lose their last three games, but they don’t have much left. A loss to Cal Poly would push UCSB underwater, with a difficult path back up to the .500 mark in the conference.</p>\n<p>To beat the Mustangs, the Gauchos must focus on at least limiting the attacking power of the high-flying sibling duo of Torrey and Adlee Van Winden.</p>\n<p>The Van Windens are Cal Poly’s best outside hitters with a combined 498 kills this season. Torrey’s 278 kills gives her the edge on her younger sister’s 220, but Adlee has an advantage in service aces with five more, 22 to 17.</p>\n<p>However, Cal Poly is more than just a sideshow.</p>\n<p>Two different attackers, seniors Raeann Greisen and Savannah Niemen, both boast over 100 kills and kill per set ratios of over two. Senior setter Taylor Nelson keeps the Mustang machine in motion with her 12.03 assists per set, which is fourth best in the nation.</p>\n<p>“[Cal Poly has] a great setter and a great offense,” UCSB head coach Nicole Welch said. “And we just have to have everybody do their part because they’re going to have some “wow” kills and we have to be okay with that and take care of the ones we can handle.”</p>\n<p>The array of attacking options, plus the setting abilities of Nelson, has provided the push behind the Mustangs’ torrid start to the season.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly appears motivated to break through after two-straight third-place conference finishes, and the Gauchos now stand squarely in their path.</p>\n<p>“Playing Cal Poly is always going to bring out a lot of excitement and aggression from our side,” UCSB head coach Nicole Welch said. “We just want to play clean volleyball, and be better this week than we were last week.”</p>\n<p>After managing just one win in 12 non-conference tries, it seemed as though UCSB had found a higher gear when the team won its first two Big West games.</p>\n<p>Three-straight road losses – to Cal State Northridge, UC Irvine and Hawai’i – have brought the Gauchos back to Earth, but there’s still time to make noise with 11 conference games remaining.</p>\n<p>“When we struggled on that road weekend, for CSUN and Long Beach, our passing kind of broke down,” Welch said. “That’s one of our strengths, so we’ve been working to get that better, and it was much better against Hawai’i and we played a much better match.”</p>\n<p>That count includes Saturday’s match against Cal Poly, likely UCSB’s toughest opponent of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need standout performances from all their top players in order to avoid being trampled by the Mustang stampede.</p>\n<p>Top on the list of standouts is redshirt sophomore outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins. Ruddins’s average of 5.42 kills per set is top in the Big West, and second-best in the nation. Junior setter Annie Hasselmann has set Ruddins up for the majority of those kills, and has a total of 467 assists this season.</p>\n<p>Junior defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi has filled her role perfectly as well, piling up a team high 317 digs at a rate of 5.20 per set. That’s the 28th best rate in the nation and the best rate in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Beating a juggernaut like Cal Poly, however, requires near-perfect execution from every player that touches the court, not just the traditional torch-bearers.</p>\n<p>That’s been lacking from this year’s iteration of Gauchos, but that’s what it will take to stop the skid and breathe new life into the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly on Saturday evening at 5 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79081\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/womens-volleyball-hopes-to-pull-off-upset-over-surging-mustangs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79081\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/womens-volleyball-hopes-to-pull-off-upset-over-surging-mustangs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/womens-volleyball-hopes-to-pull-off-upset-over-surging-mustangs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/womens-volleyball-hopes-to-pull-off-upset-over-surging-mustangs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/womens-volleyball-hopes-to-pull-off-upset-over-surging-mustangs/","id":4955,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4954,4953,4952],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to End Losing Streak at UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FILEPHOTO-WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FILEPHOTO-WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's volleyball team has lost four games in a row and will look to change that against fifth-place UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB and UC Davis women’s volleyball teams are going in opposite directions.</p>\n<p>After losing their last four games, the Gauchos are quickly sinking in the Big West.

It was a disappointing result for Head Coach Nicole Welch’s squad, but there were positive elements to build off of leading into Tuesday’s match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ passing, one of Coach Welch’s points of emphasis leading into Saturday’s match, was much improved against the Mustangs, and UCSB was able to take the first set from a juggernaut Cal Poly squad. The visitors ran off the next three to leave the Thunderdome with a win, but it certainly wasn’t all doom and gloom for the hosts.</p>\n<p>Of course, a hitting percentage of .119 won’t be enough to come away with a win on Tuesday, just like it wasn’t on Saturday. UCSB has cracked .200 in only eight of its 18 games this season, and odds are the Gauchos are going to need to make it nine if they want to have a chance against UCD.</p>\n<p>The Aggies have taken advantage of the Big West bottom-feeders recently, with all three of their consecutive wins coming against the three worst teams in the conference. A win over the sixth-place Gauchos would keep that run going.</p>\n<p>With five players boasting over 100 kills so far this season, the UCD attack is about as balanced as UCSB will see this season. Freshman outside hitter Mahalia White is top of the bunch with 231 kills at a 3.08 per set clip, impressive numbers for a true freshman.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Emily Allen is second to White with 199 kills but possesses a more well-rounded game than her younger counterpart. Allen is tied for third on the team with 14 service aces, and her 209 digs are good enough for second on the Aggie team.</p>\n<p>If White and Allen aren’t enough, UCD can also depend on junior outside hitter Brianna Karseboom, sophomore outside hitter Lauren Matias or junior middle blocker Kelechi Ohiri, all fellow members of the 100-kill club, to bring the thunder on the attack. The depth extends to the setter position as well: junior Maddie Merlino (422 assists) and freshman Paloma Bowman (367) are both reliable passers and conduits for the offense to flow through.</p>\n<p>Davis has hardly been a team of world-beaters this year, but they’ll enter Tuesday’s match with a lot more steam than UCSB. Where the Aggies simply will be looking to maintain their winning ways, the Gauchos must strive to mine the good out of their recent losses while leaving the bad behind.</p>\n<p>The clock is running out on UCSB’s season, but a victory on Tuesday would add a little more much-needed time. That’s going to require the Gauchos to put together a complete effort than they’ve managed to do in the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>UCD hosts UCSB on Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-17/gauchos-look-to-end-losing-streak-at-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-17/gauchos-look-to-end-losing-streak-at-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-17/gauchos-look-to-end-losing-streak-at-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-17/gauchos-look-to-end-losing-streak-at-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-17/gauchos-look-to-end-losing-streak-at-uc-davis/","id":4956,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4955,4954,4953],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Volleyball Ends its 4-Match Skid with Win over UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WVball_vsCSUN-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WVball_vsCSUN-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos bounced back with a win on the road at UC Davis Tuesday night.

Compare that to the Aggies, who had three players above ten kills and another with eight, and UCSB’s lack of attack diversity is stark.</p>\n<p>That didn’t matter on Tuesday night, however. Ruddins was all the offensive power the Gauchos needed, finishing with her second-highest kill total in a four-set match all season. The redshirt sophomore also led UCSB with 15 digs in her sixth double-double match of the season and her second in Big West play.</p>\n<p>Counting Tuesday night, Ruddins has led the Gauchos in kills in 14 of the team’s 19 games, and has done so in every Big West match thus far. Tuesday night’s result was just one of the more extreme occurrences of what has become a major trend for UCSB.</p>\n<p>To be clear, though, the win over the Aggies was not just a one-woman show. Libero Emilia Petrarchi also registered double-digit digs with 10. Petrarchi has finished with at least 10 kills in every game so far this season, a streak that’s landed the junior in the top-50 nationally in digs per set. She enter the weekday match No. 42 in the nation with a 4.94 average.</p>\n<p>Annie Hasselmann had a game-high 40 assists in her role as UCSB’s setter, the player who sets Ruddins up to post her wild statlines. Hasselmann put up a well-balanced statline of five kills, five digs and a service ace to go with her pile of assists, serving as a sort of Swiss Army knife for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB hit at a .242 percentage, the team’s highest rate since its loss to Cal State Northridge on Sept. 9. It was the ninth time the Gauchos cracked the .200 threshold all season. Unsurprisingly, all four of the Gauchos’ wins have come in games they’ve hit at a clip above that mark.</p>\n<p>UC Davis was only a beat behind UCSB in hitting percentage, as the Aggies hit at a .238 clip. That .004 gap, along with the Gauchos’ seven service aces, helped make the difference. UCD had more kills than UCSB in the final set, but the Aggies’ eight errors to Santa Barbara’s four doomed the hosts.</p>\n<p>They might have only needed four sets to take the win, but the Gauchos were never truly comfortable on Tuesday night. Their largest lead was five, which the Aggies promptly turned into a one-point deficit over the next four points.</p>\n<p>The final set was intense and went back-and-forth, with the Gauchos managing only an 18-14 lead as their largest advantage. Just as they had done when down five, UCD quickly cleaned up the deficit, this time tying the match up at 18.</p>\n<p>Both teams played continuously exchanged points down the stretch of that fourth set. Davis managed to take a 23-22 lead, its first advantage since it led 4-3 early on, but UCSB won four of the next five points to clinch the match.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a back-to-back against Long Beach State on Friday, followed by Cal State Northridge on Saturday night. Both games will begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome, and will give the Gauchos two chances to avenge earlier conference losses to both opponents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79172\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79172\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/","id":4957,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4956,4955,4954],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
