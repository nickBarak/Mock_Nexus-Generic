CSD. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) is including the Isla Vista Compost Collective (IVCC) under its payroll as a parent organization, but the IVCC will continue to fund itself independently from the I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it lost its funding, IVCC has been unable to provide stipends to its 10 management and shift positions. Students have continued to work for IVCC on a volunteer basis this academic year, but IVCC has stalled compost collection to the 96 homes it currently serves and cannot expand to the 100 homes currently on its waitlist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization was created in Fall Quarter 2017 by current IVCC director and fourth-year environmental science major Jacob Bider, who conceived the idea of a grassroots-level composting group in I.V. when he moved out of on-campus housing after his freshman year and realized there was no composting in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider applied for an internship at the Santa Barbara chapter of the Surfrider Foundation and in his application proposed a student-led composting program to I.V. He and other Surfrider interns then began developing the composting initiative, which officially began in Winter Quarter 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents in I.V. can apply for composting buckets at their homes to be picked up weekly by IVCC dirtriders –– student workers for IVCC who pick up the bins each week, sort and deliver compost to gardens around I.V. and then bring the buckets back to people’s homes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC started in Winter Quarter 2018 by serving approximately 10 homes and proceeded to double in size by the next quarter. A grant from the Coastal Fund in Spring Quarter 2018 allowed them to continue expanding, and by Fall Quarter 2019, IVCC was providing compost services to 96 homes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC’s past three years of growth began stalling at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019 when Surfrider notified IVCC that shift workers like dirtriders were not allowed to be paid under a stipend and had to be paid by the hour instead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider said in an interview that the amount dirtriders receive on a stipend is equal to minimum wage, and that the decision to have stipends was proposed in its original funding with the Coastal Fund, but that they have now expanded beyond that model’s capacity. Surfrider told IVCC that they needed to switch their shift workers from stipends to payroll, but as a nonprofit, Surfrider didn’t have the capacity to do so. As a result, IVCC dissolved its relationship with Surfrider.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main problem the IVCC faced was its lack of a parent organization; the program didn’t need funding, Bider explained — it has a development team that works to apply for grant funding to help it expand operations. But in order to apply for any funding and put employees on a payroll system, it needed a larger organization to be a part of.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC then turned to the Office of Student Life (OSL) to absorb it but found it couldn’t put their shift workers on any payroll system. IVCC also reached out to Associated Students (A.S.) and the Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) but were told that “due to various policies, A.S. cannot take on the program,” Bider said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider also spoke with Katie Maynard, event manager and coordinator of UCSB Sustainability, and was told that they were already spread too thin and could not take on the payroll for the IVCC; when IVCC tried reaching out to the Department of Environmental Studies, it was told that it’s “not in the nature” of an academic department to take on a project like the IVCC, Bider said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVCC then reached out to MarBorg Industries, a waste management company that collects residential and other compost. Currently, 20% of the compost collected by IVCC goes to MarBorg in order to prevent overflow of the three gardens that collect compost in I.V., according to Bider. MarBorg also told IVCC that it was unable to take on the group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But throughout the talks with various departments, Bider said there was a recurring name: the I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re seeking a partner that can provide us with institutional longevity and because [the I.V. CSD is] a governmental institution with paid staff and a board, you can provide us with that,” he said during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director George Thurlow suggested moving the conversation along to the next agenda item in the same vein: discussion regarding the possibility of composting bins at the Isla Vista Community Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jonathan Abboud, general manager for the I.V. CSD, MarBorg Industries offered to supply the community center with two free composting bins for six months. MarBorg stressed the importance of having the bins strictly managed; if the bins were open 24/7, people could toss in non-compostable items and render the compost useless, Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the option of having bins at the community center, the I.V. CSD began discussing ways for the IVCC to take part in providing a compost service in I.V. — something that combines the IVCC and the possibility of bins at the community center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Jay Freeman drafted a motion to direct staff to draft a memorandum of understanding between the IVCC and I.V. CSD for potential composting services for I.V., while authorizing the IVCC to approach organizations for possible sources of funding. The motion passed 7-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the IVCC has been stuck in a waiting period this academic year while searching for a new organization, students have continued their work on a volunteer basis. IVCC recently implemented a composting event service, where groups can apply on the IVCC website for composting at its events. IVCC also partnered with A.S. to hold a non-perishable food drive called Food on Wheels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As much as we want to communicate the struggles we’ve been through, we also want to communicate the fact that we’re still here and we’re really ready to get back into running and we have some things that we’re excited to promote too,” Ily Logeais, IVCC marketing and communications manager, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logeais said it was important for IVCC to find a group like the I.V. CSD to sponsor it that was just as invested in local, grassroots initiatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Automatically with the term grassroots, there’s a sense of community involved,” Logeais said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not just one person doing it and it’s not a business doing it. It’s Jacob as a freshman deciding that there’s no composting services available and I.V., and being like, ‘we need to change this,’ and then other people being inspired with that getting onboard.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

roughly 200 students gathered under Storke Tower at 8 p.m. to mourn the loss of Bryant, 41, and Gianna, 13. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News of Bryant’s death sent ripples of emotion throughout the United States and the rest of the world. An icon to many, fans paid tribute to Bryant and his legacy by holding vigils all over the world, but most prominently at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, home to Bryant’s 20-year tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers, The New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/kobe-bryant-la-california.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Santa Barbara, about an hour and a half away from the crash site, an outpour of roughly 200 students gathered under Storke Tower at 8 p.m. to mourn the loss of Bryant, 41, and Gianna, 13.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university was also home to Bryant’s basketball camp, the </span><a href=\"http://www.youth-basketball-camps.com/camps/kobe-bryant-basketball-camp/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kobe Basketball Academy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which ran for eight years at the Thunderdome and was designed to help kids hone their basketball skills, </span><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/kobe_bryant_impact_inspiration_santa_barbara_county_basketball_20200126\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noozhawk reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the center of the vigil rested a picture of Bryant and his daughter, a bouquet of flowers and a poster inscribed “RIP #24 MAMBA.” Bryant’s numbers — 8 and 24 — glimmered off the jerseys of students facing the candlelight, while shades of purple and gold draped the crowd from the many who sported Lakers attire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously, if you came out, Kobe meant a lot to you,” Nasrat Hamid, a fourth-year chemistry major and the event’s organizer, said to the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s kind of crazy how someone I’m sure most of us have never met before had such a huge impact on our lives. It’s kind of silly when you think about it — I’ve never met this guy but here I am crying my eyes out because he just passed away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamid organized the event earlier that same day after emailing Chancellor Henry T. Yang for permission to hold the vigil, and Yang helped provide Hamid with microphones for the event. After getting permission, Hamid’s sister, Nishat Hamid, said they used social media to let students know an event in Bryant’s honor would be taking place that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamid spoke to the crowd first, leaving the microphone open for students who wanted to share their favorite memories about Bryant, the impact he had on their lives and what they’ll remember most about him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As students spoke through the tears, those in the crowd banded together, arms wrapped around one another as they mourned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student who took the mic saw Bryant’s death as an opportunity to look back and resolve the negativities in life that weren’t worth the frustration they caused. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you have any conflict with anyone, maybe just resolve it and say ‘I love you,’ even in  a friendly way. It’s what Kobe would have wanted,” the student said. “I love that man, and even though I don’t know anyone here, I love you all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just keep powering through [your] own lives and look around and love those near [you] because we are not guaranteed a tomorrow.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the minutes leading up to the moment of silence at 8:24 p.m. — to honor both of Bryant’s jersey numbers — one student put his phone next to the microphone to play Lil Wayne’s “Kobe Bryant” after asking the crowd if they’d like to hear the song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few minutes of silence, students resumed speaking to the crowd as others began to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student recalled how an introduction to basketball — and later, a passion for it — came from Bryant, who inspired them to pick up a ball after watching him on television. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m having fun. Kobe taught me how to love the game,” the student said. “I have this Kobe poster in my room and now I can’t look at it all that much anymore, just because it hurts that much.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never got to watch Kobe live, I never got to meet him in person,” the student added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, I will never get the chance to.”</span></p>\n<p>[<em>Correction Jan. 28, 8:33 a.m.]: In a previous version of this article, Nishat Hamid’s name was misspelled.

Even though she joined the team as a walk-on, Hogan worked hard and became co-captain of the 2001 swim team that ultimately won a Big West Championship, its first title since 1995 at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since graduating from UCSB, Hogan, now 37 years old, has continued competing as an athlete with her biggest achievement coming earlier this year when she qualified to represent the United States in the 2016 Rio Olympics. However, Hogan is not representing the United States women’s swim team, instead, she is representing a sport that is not talked about much and does not even exist in NCAA athletics: the canoe/kayaking team.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

However, Hogan was not even introduced to the sport until 2004 when she was in San Diego to try to make a spot on the U.S.’ surf skiing team for the upcoming Goodwill Games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although not being used to this sport and facing tremendous competition, Hogan picked up the sport a lot quicker than anyone could’ve expected and earned a spot on the U.S. national team in 2005. From then on she has been training hard, waiting for her chance to one day represent the U.S. in the Olympic games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a nine-year career and not making the cut in 2008 and 2012, Hogan considered retirement. Instead, she decided to switch coaches and chose Michele Eray, a 2008 Olympian for South Africa. From then on, Hogan continued to work toward her dream, and her hard work paid off as in the 2015 Canoe Sprint World Championships she placed bronze in the K1 1000m, the first medal by a U.S. citizen in the World Championships in 20 years. Not only that, but she was the first American woman ever to receive a medal at said championships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, her work was not done there. In order to qualify as a K1 ( the individual event in Kayaking) athlete, the Philadelphia native would need to be the best not only of the U.S. competitors but the entire Pan American region as well. After winning the National Team Trials 500m, Hogan’s focus shifted to the Pan Am championships where placing first would guarantee her a spot in the Rio Olympics.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72053\" style=\"width: 340px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72053\" data-attachment-id=\"72053\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/former-gaucho-swim-captain-makes-olympic-debut-as-kayaker/0430trials9_featured/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?fit=640%2C424&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,424\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Maggie Hogan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?fit=640%2C424&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-72053\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?resize=330%2C219\" alt=\"Courtesy of Maggie Hogan\" width=\"330\" height=\"219\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/0430trials9_featured.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72053\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Maggie Hogan</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she was unable to take first, which went to Canada’s Lisa Bissonnette who edged out a win by .47, Hogan’s second place finish still qualified for the Rio Olympics because Canada had already earned a spot in Rio at the World Championships.</span></p>\n<p>And with that a 12-year journey came to fruition and dreams had finally come true for one Maggie Hogan. At age 37, it’s a safe bet that this will be Hogan’s first and only Olympics but that won’t make this moment any less special for her.
