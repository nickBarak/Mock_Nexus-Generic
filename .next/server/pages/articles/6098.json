My parents shared this knowledge with us kids repeatedly and casually. “You’re equal parts Irish and German, we hope you one day attend college and you have an addictive personality.” I understand my parents’ decision to equip me with this knowledge, and so far I have applied it in a precautionary way. However, it isn’t difficult to imagine how it can backfire. What starts as precaution can easily evolve into a crutch, a reason to acquiesce to addiction.</p>\n<p>Rumor has it, addiction sneaks up on you. Drug experimentation begins with the assumption that you won’t be the one who becomes addicted. Whether or not you have a genetic propensity feels irrelevant. However, addiction removes the ability to maintain control. Addiction affects a specific part of your brain — the prefrontal cortex. Rational thought belongs to the prefrontal cortex. As addiction sets in, impulsive behavior goes unchecked, steadily chipping away at rational thought. Life becomes a cyclic, means-to-an-end battle. Feeding the addiction becomes the primary focus, and organizing your life becomes almost impossible.</p>\n<p>The concept and acknowledgment of addiction is nothing new. We all remember the public service announcements on TV as kids: the “this is your brain on drugs” and anti-drug campaigns. What these campaigns failed to convey is the vast array of possible addictions. To most people, the idea of an addict conjures images of heroin and methamphetamine users. While these drugs are proven to be highly addictive and have earned their right as the poster children of addiction, they marginalize the growing issues surrounding less stigmatized drugs, like prescription drugs and home remedies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Many addictions begin with self-medication. My cousin struggled with what was diagnosed as depression and anxiety as a teenager. He experimented with a range of different substances and eventually also discovered poppy seed tea — a home-brewed concoction that contains a number of opiates in various concentrations, including morphine and codeine. At some point, he realized the stronghold that addiction had on him. He sought help. He turned to a psychiatrist and confided that he was caught in the throes of addiction. Throughout the course of the next year, the psychiatrist prescribed him nine different highly addictive prescription drugs. In effect, he traded one addiction for another. His personality changed, along with his priorities. Every relationship he had suffered, and many disappeared altogether.</p>\n<p>I have been periodically haunted by a moment my cousin and I shared four years ago. We were driving together in a car, and he was explaining his bleak outlook on life to me. Conversations of this nature were nothing unusual for us. We complement each other in the most frustrating of ways; I’m optimistic to a fault and his pessimism is overwhelming. We find middle ground in our questionable senses of humors. He was telling me he was trying to stop smoking weed for a while, but consequently was smoking more than a pack of cigarettes a day. He looked at me and said, “I don’t know if you know this about me, but I have what’s called ‘an addictive personality.’” It was a joke, and I laughed. Two years later he would find himself completely reliant on prescription drugs, taking over four times the recommended dosage of some of the medication every day. I’ve wondered if I had been able to peer into his future if I’d have been able to feign amusement. He checked into a holistic rehabilitation program after a full-blown intervention. He now acknowledges he found himself in a position he couldn’t overcome without help, but resisting relapse will be his life-long challenge.</p>\n<p>Drug availability and culture is dynamic. It’s a slippery slope when parents and esteemed medical doctors can become suppliers and enablers. It’s equally startling to realize how many times I have acted as an enabler. I have little faith in corporate integrity and find the motives and organization of the pharmaceutical industry troubling. However, I do believe in my own ability to call shenanigans. It’s easy to minimize substance abuse issues in a university setting, but that doesn’t mean it’s wise. Stop every now and again to assess your priorities. Help your friends do the same. Realize when experimentation has begun to exceed innocent indulgence. Addiction can be isolating. Spend time reaching out to friends and family, and risk overreacting.</p>\n<p><em>Jenna Ryan is the Opinion Editor at the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/accountability-addictions-stronghold/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/accountability-addictions-stronghold/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/accountability-addictions-stronghold/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/accountability-addictions-stronghold/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/accountability-addictions-stronghold/","id":6098,"author":{"id":533,"name":"Jenna Ryan"},"related":[6097,6096,6095],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":533,"name":"Jenna Ryan","biography":"Not available","articles":[6098],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Closure of Coal Oil Point Reserve Trails Unimaginative, Unfair","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I’ve got bad news for those of you who like to jog or hike around the Coal Oil Point Reserve.

You will discover that while you were all away for Christmas break, the university has blocked off, and is in the process of obliterating, all the reserve’s internal trails. The only trail which remains is the route along the edge of the Devereux Slough leading to the beach. There is no alternative route back from there, so if there’s a high tide or you simply prefer to stay in the reserve you’ll just have to turn around and go back the way you came. This also means that it is no longer possible to access the reserve from Ellwood Mesa, or vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Notices displayed on the trail barriers indicate that this is the implementation of an agreed plan between UCSB, the Goleta City Council and the County of Santa Barbara. The notices assure us that the objective is to create a balance between public access and environmental restoration, or some such. But it is surely a strange balance when there are now no internal access paths at all within the reserve.</p>\n<p>I have jogged along these trails almost every other morning for the past 15 years, often pausing simply to enjoy the quiet beauty of the place. So for me, and I’m sure for many others both inside and outside the university, the destruction of these trails will seriously reduce the quality of my life. There is no balance in it for me. All I see is the creation of an enormous wild garden which no one can appreciate from within. I ask myself how even the university’s researchers will be able to gain access from now on without causing more damage trampling about than if they had a few trails to follow.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It isn’t clear to me what the rationale behind the closure of these trails might be. I don’t see that the mere presence of people causes unacceptable disturbance. I can only think it may be argued that the closure was necessary because of damage caused by mountain bikes. This is certainly a genuine problem. Bikes are banned from the reserve, but it only takes one antisocial and inconsiderate biker after a rainy day to cause a disproportionate amount of damage. There is even a rogue horse rider on thankfully rare occasions.</p>\n<p>But the damage caused by this thoughtlessness is confined to the trails. The only, if very annoying, adverse effect is to make the path very uneven for subsequent joggers and hikers like me. It is true that the damage is exacerbated by erosion during winter storms, but this tends to form gullies and deepen the paths, rather than widen them. There is no observable encroachment on the rest of the reserve.</p>\n<p>The solution to this problem is surely to manage the upkeep of the paths, not to erase them. Regrading them once a year after the rain would probably be sufficient, as would adding a few steps in steep areas. And although it would probably never be possible to keep out every horse or sufficiently determined mountain biker, it would surely be possible to fence in the remaining land boundary of the reserve which is not fenced already, and install entrance gates of the kind which until recently stood on Coal Oil Point to prevent bikes accessing the beach.</p>\n<p>It is extremely disappointing that the university should pursue such an unimaginative and aggressive reserve management policy, and that both the Goleta City Council and the County of Santa Barbara should apparently have endorsed it. I earnestly hope that whatever committees are responsible for these things will get together and reconsider. I think of all the nature reserves and parks that I have visited over the years which have been able to achieve a much happier balance than this between the presence of people and the restoration of the natural environment. Surely Coal Oil Point Reserve can do better.</p>\n<p><em>Michael Freeston lives in Goleta.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43363\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-08/closure-coal-oil-point-reserve-trails-unimaginative-unfair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43363\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-08/closure-coal-oil-point-reserve-trails-unimaginative-unfair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-08/closure-coal-oil-point-reserve-trails-unimaginative-unfair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-08/closure-coal-oil-point-reserve-trails-unimaginative-unfair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-08/closure-coal-oil-point-reserve-trails-unimaginative-unfair/","id":6095,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6094,6093,6092],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Reality of Mental Illness: University Edition","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I’m diagnosed with a variety of psychiatric conditions: bipolar I disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD and a learning disability called dyscalculia.

As a teenager I battled anorexia nervosa. I’ve been hospitalized in a psychiatric ward three times since the age of 14, tried over 30 different kinds of psychotropic medication (most of which didn’t work) and self-harmed. I’ve shamelessly sobbed in public for no reason, stayed awake for days on end without stimulants (including caffeine), bled, bruised myself, screamed at strangers, believed I was thinking someone else’s thoughts, blacked out drunk to escape my mind, hurt people I loved and seriously contemplated suicide. Electroconvulsive therapy is a likely treatment option for my next major depressive episode. At 21, I had a voluntary tubal ligation because I feared that I would become pregnant on medications that cause severe birth defects. That being said, my life is good. I come from a loving, middle-class family and I have reliable, caring friends. It’s the hand I was dealt, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>\n<p>I’m disclosing this very personal (and obviously unflattering) information because I’m tired of the shame and stigma that surround mental illness. Actually, I’m really fucking sick of it. I want other students who are in my position to know that they aren’t alone and that at least one other person on this campus understands what it’s like to attend college while living (and often struggling) with a serious psychiatric condition.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, the most common misconception about mental illness is that it’s some sort of affectation. Many people seem to think it’s something we choose because we want attention, that we want others to make our lives “easier” with disability accommodations, or that we like the idea of being perceived as “dark and tortured.” For my generation, I feel that the stigma attached to mental illness is largely an issue of ableism. During past manic and mixed episodes (when my cognitive processes are severely disturbed) people have told me to exercise and eat a more nutritious diet, as if swimming laps and consuming protein will automatically fix my brain chemistry. People who give this type of advice are under the false impression that my emotional instability, crawling skin and racing thoughts are a result of poor lifestyle choices. They are wrong.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Experiencing a bipolar episode is a lot like having the flu — I can’t take care of myself, and for the most part, I can’t control my illness. I can take preventative measures but ultimately what goes up must come crashing down, and it’s often a matter of weathering the storm, waiting for symptoms to pass. It’s all I can do to keep myself out of the hospital and in school when I lose stability. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I don’t bathe, I isolate myself. Walking to the mailbox becomes a daunting task. I can’t find the will to tie my shoelaces so I wear bright purple rain boots on hot, sunny days. My limbs are heavy, my thoughts disorganized and maddening. Scariest of all, these episodes often come on without warning, develop over the course of a week and leave damage that sometimes lasts months or years. The only solution that even makes a dent in my mental health problems is a medication regimen consisting of mind-numbing lithium, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines and occasionally antipsychotics. If it were possible to remedy mental health problems with diet and exercise, I wouldn’t have issues in the first place.</p>\n<p>Mentally ill students can’t just “pick themselves up by their bootstraps.” We don’t want attention. We do everything we can to get through the day, hoping, praying, that we stay stable long enough to complete our courses and earn our degrees. We hide our scars, prescription bottles, medication-induced tremors. We rely on the Americans with Disabilities Act to cover our asses in the event that something goes wrong and we need to take a leave of absence without academic penalty. We work hard to conceal our unpredictable and unstable brains for fear of being thought of as “lazy,” “self-indulgent” and “crazy.” Worst of all, should we reveal an ounce of weakness, we might be told — despite our good grades, resilience and other accomplishments — that we “just aren’t cut out for university life.”</p>\n<p>I am privileged to have had the opportunity to attend college. Sixty years ago I would have been institutionalized with no hope for a future. I would’ve been expected to bag groceries for a living. Today, people like me are doctors, lawyers, academicians, artists, authors, librarians and nurses. You walk past us on campus all the time. We are elusive, yet omnipresent. If you met me, you would have no idea. I’m intelligent, vivacious, strong, stubborn and tender-hearted. At first glance, I am anything but mentally ill. Dig a little deeper, though, and you’ll realize that everyone has a story. This is mine. All I’m asking is that you recognize, reader, that psychiatric conditions are legitimate medical problems. Next time, please think before you judge.</p>\n<p><em>Leslie Purdie is a fourth-year cultural anthropology major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43365\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/reality-mental-illness-university-edition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43365\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/reality-mental-illness-university-edition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/reality-mental-illness-university-edition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/reality-mental-illness-university-edition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-09/reality-mental-illness-university-edition/","id":6096,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6095,6094,6093],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Deltopia: Still Not as Bad as Miller-Young","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In this Letter to the Editor, Jason Garshfield describes how he is more outraged over the Miller-Young incident than the Deltopia riots.

However, of the two mobs, I honestly find the Miller-Young mob to be far more worrisome. The Deltopia riot was leaderless and meaningless, chaos for the sake of chaos. When the police attempt to close a street full of 15,000 drunk revelers, many of them out-of-towners with no loyalty to our community, a riot is all but inevitable.</p>\n<p>The Miller-Young attack, on the other hand, was not leaderless or meaningless. It was led by one of our professors. Rather than setting an example of tolerance for the opposition, and restraint in the face of provocative views, she set an example of violent censorship. And, although actions have elicited criminal charges and have been denounced by Vice Chancellor Michael Young, far too many students and professors at our university have lionized Miller-Young into an unfairly accused victim. One online petition, with nearly 2,000 signatures, demands that UCSB “issue a statement of support” for the professor who belittled and assaulted a 16-year-old girl, expresses “love &amp; solidarity to Professor Miller-Young” as a “womyn of color,” and asks that school policy be changed to remove triggering (read: unpopular) speech.</p>\n<p>As a UCSB student, I am more ashamed of our reaction to the Miller-Young incident than I am of the Deltopia riot.</p>\n<p>Even many of those who denounced Professor Miller-Young still blamed the protestors for provoking her to anger. The same people who are so fond of constantly haranguing everyone about the fact that there are no excuses for rape might do well to keep in mind that there are also no excuses for violent censorship — “she was asking for it” just doesn’t cut it in this case anymore than it does in cases of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>People have pointed the finger at a number of possible causes for the Deltopia riots — the influx of out-of-towners, the recent installation of security cameras in Isla Vista, poor handling of the noise ordinance announcement by the police and local government. Allow me to point the finger at another possible contributing factor: Mireille Miller-Young and the students and faculty who supported her.</p>\n<p>Mob psychology can be extremely powerful. As someone who witnessed part of the riots on Saturday night, I can say that the excitement in the air was palpable and there was a definite temptation to abandon all reason and revel in the chaos. Of course, another (and I’m proud to say much larger) part of me was horrified at the pointless destruction — but if I had believed that the ruckus and mayhem could be carried out in pursuit of a higher cause, it might have been a different story. Getting to smash stuff and justify it in the name of social justice — what could be more fun? For many immature people, letting loose one’s most primeval destructive energy and being lionized for it is the ultimate win-win, and many student riots start this way. Thrill-seekers go looking for a good time, knowing they can justify their actions by saying they were sticking it to the man or fighting for Rodney King or trying to help destroy the military industrial complex which is hurting those poor Palestinians and Iraqis, which I’m sure the overgrown children smashing store windows and stealing stuff care soooo much about.</p>\n<p>The partygoers who rioted Saturday night did not have any ostensible higher justification to fall back on, but the attackers led by Professor Miller-Young did. Operating on their most primitive impulses, they claimed instead to be acting from their most noble beliefs. When confronted with a view in opposition to yours, coming up with a rebuttal is hard — It takes work and brainpower. But raging at them, verbally and physically attacking them and stealing their property — that’s easy, and it’s also fun! Who cares about some noble abstraction like free speech, when you can fuck shit up in the moment? And why should you think twice, when you know that you will probably not face serious consequences for your actions? If the “Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust” were a little less litigious, Professor Miller-Young would be in no trouble at all. She would have received a half-assed denouncement of her actions from the school, and a good deal of public hatred that would have been more than offset by the hordes of social justice warriors making her into their latest sick role model.</p>\n<p>And when UCSB students learn by example that they can form violent mobs and get away with it … is it really any surprise, what happened in Isla Vista the other night?</p>\n<p><em>Jason Garshfield is a second-year political science major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
