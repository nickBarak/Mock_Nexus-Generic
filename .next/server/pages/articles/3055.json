He’ll get a chance this year. Thus far, he has seen the majority of the starts for San Diego and appears to have locked up the starting job. He isn’t likely to hit .340 for the rest of the season, but his average is not as inflated as it might appear. He is also currently sporting a .397 OBP and a .571 slugging percentage, meaning that he is not simply getting lucky hits. He is making solid contact and is getting on base. Once his numbers come back down to earth, he will continue to be a strong play at catcher.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>David Freese</strong> <em>3B, St. Louis Cardinals: .333 AVG, 2 HR, 9 RBI (Availability: 30.3 percent)</em></p>\n<p>Freese’s rookie season was cut short due to injury, causing his owners grief because of his productivity. Before he went down, he was sporting a .296 average with 36 RBI through 70 games. This season, he has immediately proven that last season was not a fluke. His average and his .481 slugging percentage are slightly inflated, but his OBP is right where it was last year. Even when his other stats come down, he should still maintain an average around .300 and slug about .400, which any fantasy owner would be delighted with — especially for a player they got off the waiver wire. He does tend to strike out more often than he walks, but you can start him with confidence as long as he continues to get on base.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Kyle McClellan</strong> <em>RP, St. Louis Cardinals: 2-0, 1.89 ERA, 1.26 WHIP (Availability: 79.9 percent)</em></p>\n<p>In three starts, he has racked up 13 strikeouts to just six walks and didn’t walk a single batter in his last start. He has also gone at least six innings in all three starts, which means that he is doing a good job of keeping his pitch count relatively low. In his last start, he threw 94 pitches over seven innings to beat the much more well-known Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>\n<p>He has not faced a particularly tough lineup thus far, but his stats — particularly his WHIP — are in line with what they were when he was a reliever. That means that he most likely won’t start giving up a lot of walks and hits each game and will continue to have success as a starter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Jordan Walden</strong> <em>RP, Los Angeles Angels: 0.00 ERA, 0.84 WHIP, 3 SV (Availability: 16.6 percent)</em></p>\n<p>Walden won’t be available for long, but get him if you can. In only his second professional season, he has 10 strikeouts on just four walks and throws in the high 90s. That kind of power and control is a recipe for success in the major leagues, especially for pitchers in the closer role. He has not locked up the job just yet, but it’s his to lose. His only competition is Fernando Rodney, whose control is spotty at best.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mitch Moreland</strong> <em>1B, Texas Rangers: .313 AVG, .389 OBP, .563 SLG (Availability: 32.4 percent)</em></p>\n<p>Last season, his first in the majors, Moreland showed his power potential after belting nine homers and slugging .469 through 47 games. His slugging percentage has increased this season, suggesting that his power has not left him even though he’s only hit one home run so far.  His average has increased significantly from last season, when he hit .255. I’m not saying his average will remain as high as it is, but if he can keep it above .280 he will be one of the top fantasy first basemen. Especially once he starts hitting the ball out of the park more.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em> MLB columnist Joshua Greenberg wouldn’t be available in a single fantasy staff writer league, guaranteed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36769\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/green-advice-green-people-overlook-leagues-overlooked-talent/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36769\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/green-advice-green-people-overlook-leagues-overlooked-talent/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/green-advice-green-people-overlook-leagues-overlooked-talent/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/green-advice-green-people-overlook-leagues-overlooked-talent/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-20/green-advice-green-people-overlook-leagues-overlooked-talent/","id":3055,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[3054,3053,3052],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg","biography":"Not available","articles":[286,294,298,299,410,422,425,430,1687,2124,2127,2130,2137,2139,2287,2304,2786,2808,2865,2871,2894,2897,3055,3145,3500,3501,4518,4529,5174,5175,5176,5177,5178,5180,5181,5182,5184,5188,5212,5216,5221,5222,5223,5224,5225,5226,5227,5228,5229,5235,5255,5256,5257,5463,5464,5466,5552],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet explained the unusual situation in an email.</p>\n<p>“Due to the fact that the agenda didn’t get sent out to the list servers on time, we are conducting a phone vote this week so we aren’t breaking the Brown Act,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>During Public Forum, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming presented to the Senate further details about the meningitis vaccine UCSB will offer in the Recreation Center for a two-week period starting this Monday. According to Flemming, acquiring the vaccine required the cooperation of around 150 administrators and other staff.</p>\n<p>“This is a pretty extraordinary effort that’s underway right now,” Fleming said. “There are probably about 150 people from campus working on this — probably about 30 of them working full time to make this happen.”</p>\n<p>Fleming addressed concerns regarding side effects of the vaccine, citing a recent case in which the vaccine was administered to a large number of people with no serious repercussions.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know about the countries, but Princeton is probably the best example recently. We understand that they gave close to six thousand and they didn’t have any significant adverse reactions, except for just a sore arm and a few students fainted,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>Later, A.S. President Jonathan Abboud informed the Senate on the expected cost of the meningitis vaccine and ways to mitigate its financial impact on any particular department.</p>\n<p>“The estimated cost of the meningitis vaccine for everybody is two million dollars,” Abboud said. “There’s no set place approved to pay for it yet … we want to spread the costs a little bit, because faculty get meningitis too, they are with us everyday.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also discussed a proposed Associated Students food cart in the University Center, saying it would benefit many students.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can actually have an A.S. run food service like most A.S.’s have, and we can give students experience running a business,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore gave a brief presentation in which he said he was working to get the architect of the new development planned for I.V. known as “The Nest” to speak at next weeks Senate meeting and answer questions from the public.</p>\n<p>“I know he said he wanted to speak to students about it, so I told him this would be a great opportunity to speak to a bunch of students,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Also during the meeting, the UCSB Investment Advisory Committee presented to the Senate its plans to reinvest a portion of its funding into the bank Barclay’s and 10-year Mexican treasury bonds as a response to projected higher interest rates in the near future.</p>\n<p>Other items discussed at the meeting included a new student literary arts magazine titled The Catalyst that will accept work from students of all majors and ages, A.S. funding for a planned Persian New Years event with authentic Persian food, a proposal to commission a mural at the I.V. Community Center at Pardall and the Battle of the Bands concert that will be held next Wednesday at the Hub at 6:30pm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54126\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54126\" data-attachment-id=\"54126\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/a-s-senate-discusses-new-vaccine-future-projects/as-senate-kenneth-song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1501%2C793&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1501,793\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1392843783\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"85\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate Kenneth Song\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=250%2C132&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=888%2C469&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-54126\" alt=\"Other items discussed at the meeting included a Persian New Years event and the upcoming Battle of the Bands. \" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AS-Senate-Kenneth-Song-1024x540.jpg?resize=610%2C321\" width=\"610\" height=\"321\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-54126\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Other items discussed at the meeting included a Persian New Years event and the upcoming Battle of the Bands.</p></div>\n<p>Photo by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, February 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The lecture, “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,” has inspired a number of similar ‘last lecture’ series at other universities, including UCSB’s very own series, according to one of the organizers of the event, Angela Lau, a third-year economics and accounting major. UCSB’s “Last Lecture” series began three years ago with a presentation by psychology professor Alan Fridlund, who spoke about his academic and personal life with a retrospective lens.</p>\n<p>Every year, students nominate a professor to speak. According to second-year psychology major and Spanish minor Sarah Breslaw, who helped organize the event alongside other students in A.S., the nomination is reached by an inclusive, democratic process held solely by the students.</p>\n<p>“It’s all based on voting. We sent out a mass email to all students a few months back, requesting that they [choose] which professor they’d prefer to give their most meaningful lecture ever,” Breslaw said. “From there, the top three are picked out, and we personally ask them if they would be interested.”</p>\n<p>Professor Kennedy — who won the nomination “hands-down” according to Breslaw — said he feels honored to speak this year and suggested that his selection comes from the way he tries to introduce students to new ideas during class time.</p>\n<p>“I would imagine it has something to do with the messages I present in the larger classes I teach and how they provide new insights about language to students that they [personally] would have never thought of before,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>Although he has not yet chosen a title for his last lecture, Kennedy said he knows what the content of his presentation will be.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be talking about the kinds of big picture messages that we can get from paying attention to details about things and subjects that we love,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Wednesday, February 26, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54203\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/third-annual-last-lecture-features-professor-kennedy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54203\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/third-annual-last-lecture-features-professor-kennedy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/third-annual-last-lecture-features-professor-kennedy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/third-annual-last-lecture-features-professor-kennedy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-26/third-annual-last-lecture-features-professor-kennedy/","id":3053,"author":{"id":186,"name":"Jessy Diamba"},"related":[3052,3051,3050],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Judicial Council Petitions Resolved After Nine Months","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aselections2018-7159.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aselections2018-7159.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Nawar Nemeh was the petitioner in both of the cases; in Nemeh and Morales v.
