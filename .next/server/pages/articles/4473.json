The Gauchos lost all three road games by a combined score of 29-14.</p>\n<p>With the losses, UCSB drops to No. 7 overall in conference with a 10-14 league record and a 24-27 mark overall. The Mustangs currently rank No. 3 with a 12-8 league record.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s series closer was the closest chance UCSB got to scraping together a win, yet Cal Poly was able to hold the lead through the ninth inning for a 9-8 victory. UCSB junior outfielder Brett Vertigan went two-for-four at the plate with one run and two RBIs, while senior outfielder Lance Roenicke went three-for-five with two runs and one RBI. Senior outfielder Joe Wallace led the Gauchos offensively on a three-for-four outing with two runs and one RBI in the game. Cal Poly senior shortstop Mike Miller went two-for-four on Sunday with two runs, while sophomore left fielder David Armendariz went three- for-four with one run. Cal Poly’s pitching staff allowed 17 hits on the day and gave up eight earned runs along with four strikeouts. UCSB’s Zak Edgington gave up five runs and 10 hits in six innings pitched, and Greg Mahle allowed four more runs in 1.2 innings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Friday’s series opener provided the stage for Cal Poly’s junior right-hander Joey Wagman to throw a complete game, allowing the Mustangs to secure a 5-1 win. Wagman allowed just one run on five hits, while UCSB’s starter Kevin Gelinas threw five innings and allowed five earned runs. Gelinas struck out three batters in the process.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs scored all five of their runs by the sixth inning, in which they led UCSB 5-0, and allowed only one run scored in the eighth. Vertigan led the Gauchos with two hits in four at-bats and one RBI, while freshman outfielder Luke Swenson scored UCSB’s only run of the game on Vertigan’s single. Saturday’s second game of the series saw UCSB give up the most runs to any team all season. Cal Poly’s 15 runs also mark a tie at the most that the Mustangs have scored this year (15 against Pacific on April 28). Eleven of the runs came in the fifth inning alone, an inning in which the Gauchos all but gave up the game to the Cal Poly offense. UCSB’s five runs came all in the second inning and highlighted a run sparked by Roenicke’s two-run double.</p>\n<p>The high-scoring fifth inning for Cal Poly was catalyzed by a combination of junior center fielder Mitch Haniger’s three-run home run and a three-run triple that gave the Mustang offense the advantage for the remainder of the game. Haniger currently leads the league in slugging percentage with a .616 average.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to the practice field today in preparation for a home game against USC tomorrow afternoon at 3 p.m., which will be the Gauchos’ final home game of the year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47040\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/gauchos-struggle-final-big-west-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47040\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/gauchos-struggle-final-big-west-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/gauchos-struggle-final-big-west-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/gauchos-struggle-final-big-west-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-21/gauchos-struggle-final-big-west-series/","id":4473,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4472,4471,4470],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella","biography":"Not available","articles":[716,743,762,820,848,852,1078,1644,1646,1647,1648,1649,1651,1654,1662,1665,1667,1671,1672,1673,1677,1678,1679,1683,1684,1686,1688,1690,1693,1694,1695,1696,1700,1719,1757,1761,1764,1767,1768,2160,2844,4375,4473,4491,4502,4510,4511,4512,4513,4514,4515,4516,4517,4519,4520,4527,4528,4530,4532,4536,4537,4538,4542,4543,4547,4557,4559,4561,4562,4564,4565,4566,5533],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Surf Report: Feb. 10 to 12","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sands-Beach_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sands-Beach_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"When are the swells swell?

Knew you’d be back again for the inside on catching the insides this weekend. Now, because of the overwhelming demand on my surf expertise, I have decided to bless ya with yet another completely accurate compilation of my surf report. If y’all didn’t catch that last bit of sarcasm, I wish you the best with reading the rest of this and hope you know these are surf predictions, not something to bet your life on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any case, let’s move on to the nitty gritty. Now, the west-northwest swell (WNW) is making an appearance this weekend, meaning those ocean storms are still blowing over here. It’s not the strongest surge, but it’s definitely causing some waves for us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let’s take a look at the three amigos, shall we?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday: best swells, worst weather; 4-6 feet, largest waves in the p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday: average swells, average weather; 3-5 feet, better surf in the a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday: eh swells, but great weather; 1-3 feet all day</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, before you go running off asking the paddle boarders for some wax (please don’t), let me warn you about the rain coming on Friday. Oftentimes, rain means bacterial runoff being really present in the water during and after first day of rain. I know your surfing urges plunge you into the water despite possible sickness, but please be careful. Take care of yourself for finals, okay? Don’t say I never warned the freshies.

Headshots were discouraged, but not prohibited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplicity allowed several bystanders to immediately join in and participate in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just fun. If anyone else could come out here, be silly, hit each other with foam swords and get a pretty good workout … it’s pretty good,” Fraczek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spanning over two hours, the warriors alternated among games of shirts versus skins, king of the hill, capture the flag and one-versus-one. Several warriors flung their arms around and slowly fell after being hit by a finishing blow, emphasizing the worthiness of their defeat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunter McCoole, a communication major currently taking a hiatus from school, was walking her dog when she saw the warriors fighting outside her house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It looks like it was played safe.

He allowed just five hits on the day and struck out four.</p>\n<p>The offense was led by a huge day from sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward, who drove in five runs on two hits and scored a run. Woodward got his afternoon rolling in the bottom of the third inning. With the bases loaded, Woodward singled into right center field to plate the first two runs of the game.</p>\n<p>Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa also drove in two runs with his fourth home run of the season in the bottom of the seventh.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, the offense was unable to reproduce Friday’s success as the Tigers captured a 3-2 win over the Gauchos. Junior starting pitcher John Haberman earned the win, throwing seven and a third innings and allowing just two runs while striking out five.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Robby Nesovic also pitched well, but took the loss, going six and a third and allowed three runs.</p>\n<p>Pacific got on the board first with a lead off single and two productive outs to lead to the run on sophomore center fielder Tyler Sullivan’s base hit.</p>\n<p>Both starting pitchers cruised until the seventh where they each ran into some trouble. Nesovic was touched up for two more runs on a string of singles off both Nesovic and sophomore reliever Greg Mahle.</p>\n<p>In the bottom half of the inning, the Gauchos scored their first run on an RBI single by Nesovic. In the eighth the Gauchos, who have become notorious in recent weeks for their comebacks, mustered a rally for one run, but junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon bounced into an inning ending double play and the Gauchos fell 3-2.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s home finale, the Gauchos put a seven spot on Pacific. UCSB wasted no time as they put up three runs in the bottom of the first with four consecutive singles.</p>\n<p>With the early lead sophomore starting pitcher Andrew Vasquez settled into one of his best starts of the year. Vasquez threw seven and a third shutout innings with five strikeouts en route to his second victory this season.</p>\n<p>In his home finale, senior third baseman Marc Venning doubled and also drove in a run with a sacrifice fly helping his team to take the victory 7-3.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t ask for anything more,” Venning said. “We needed to win this one; obviously all these games are important now.”</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos will be a trip to UCLA on Tuesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page five of May 20th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/gauchos-win-fifth-consecutive-series/","id":4472,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4471,4470,4469],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
