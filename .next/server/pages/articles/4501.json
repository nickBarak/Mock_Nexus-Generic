After leading 1-0 through five innings, the Dons put up a single run in the sixth to tie the score and then scored a run in the eighth to take the lead, which would be enough for the win.</p>\n<p>Losing late leads has become a trend recently for SJSU. In two games against Arizona, the Spartans held late leads but fell after some shaky relief pitching. They had a three-run lead into the seventh inning Sunday before a five-run inning followed by a four-run inning in the eighth all but put them away. On Friday they again held a lead, this time all the way to the bottom of the ninth, but a two out error led to a three run triple to cap the win for Arizona.</p>\n<p>“[San Jose] has played some tough people and have played on the road,” Checketts said. “Arizona is a tough place to go out and win and they had a lead in two of those games before they lost them late, so they will be competitive and have a chip on their shoulder.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have seen their fair share of pitching woes this early season as well. On Tuesday afternoon, a combination of three relief pitchers in the sixth inning gave up seven runs allowing UCLA to run away with the game.</p>\n<p>“There have been some freshmen that have been a little out of character,” Checketts said. “Our freshmen came in and struggled quite a bit. There were some growing pains. We would like them to grow a little faster and get through that, but I think they will bounce back and learn from it and be more prepared and tougher because of it.”</p>\n<p>One constant this year, however, has been solid starting pitching from sophomore Austin Pettibone. Friday afternoon’s scheduled starter heads into the weekend with a 1-0 record and a 0.67 earned run average in his two starts. Fellow starter sophomore Andrew Vasquez has struck out 11 through his nine innings of work and holds opponents to a .156 batting average against.</p>\n<p>At the plate, the Gauchos are led by sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa, who just had his seven-game hitting streak ended Tuesday. Kuresa, along with junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon, sophomore outfielder Luke Swenson and sophomore third baseman Peter Maris lead the team with six RBI each. The timely hitting by each player has helped to stabilize a lineup that is without its everyday third baseman in Venning.</p>\n<p>The weekend series begins today at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-01/gauchos-face-san-jose-state-at-home/","id":4501,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4500,4499,4498],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Host No. 2 UCLA After Delay","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8161.jpg?resize=300%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8161.jpg?resize=300%2C520&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team will host No. 2 UCLA today at Cesar Uyesaka Stadium.

The game had been previously scheduled for last Tuesday, but due to weather conditions was moved to today. The Gauchos are currently tied for fifth with a 4-3 record in the Big West after two weeks of play. The Bruins come to town with a 4-2 record after taking two out of a three against Baylor on the road.</p>\n<p>“We hope that the schedule can work in our favor with jet lag and the whole deal,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “It will be fun for our guys. They didn’t come here just to play baseball, they came to play good baseball teams and that’s how you prepare for the postseason. It will be a good experience for our guys.”</p>\n<p>The Bruins return home from Texas after taking games one and three from Baylor with a couple of one-run victories, sandwiching a 5-0 loss on the second game. Junior center fielder Brian Carroll went 6-12 on the weekend with three stolen bases, two runs scored and a RBI. The big weekend gives Carroll a .478 average so far on the young season, tops for the Bruins. As a team, UCLA is hitting .284 and slugging .351.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Bruins’ pitching staff has been stellar so far this year. Each of the three starting pitchers holds a sub-2.20 ERA. Junior starting pitcher Adam Plutko was named as a preseason All-American and holds a 2.13 ERA and eight strikeouts in 12-and-two-thirds innings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos come into the matchup splitting a four-game series with San Francisco. Over the weekend, sophomore utility man Joe “Woody” Woodward went 6-11, which gave him a team-high .529 batting average. Woodward has done well with the playing time he has been given and has climbed to the top of the lineup. He leads the team with three stolen bases and a .600 on-base percentage over his 17 at bats.</p>\n<p>“He just keeps doing it and doing it. He sure likes to play and he is really playing well and doing a lot of different stuff for us right now so he is really doing a good job,” Checketts said. “We moved him up in the order [Sunday] and he has just shown a lot of perseverance. He is really contributing for us.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa has also been an offensive force in the middle of the lineup so far. Kuresa enters today’s game having collected a base hit in each of the first seven games and leads the Gauchos with 11 hits, five extra base hits, six runs scored and is tied with six RBI.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s starting pitcher for the Gauchos is yet to be determined as many pitchers were used over the four-game weekend series. Saturday’s game two starting pitcher, freshman Kenny Chapman, pitched just two innings and threw 60 pitches leaving him potentially available.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure who we will go with, I need to see how the arms bounce back,” Checketts said. “We used everybody. We will see where we go. Maybe Kenny Chapman and maybe Domenic Mazza and see if Domenic can go out and be himself.”</p>\n<p>First pitch for the one-game matchup against UCLA will take place at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium today.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>Photo By MARK BROCHER / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 14 of February 26th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50361\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/gauchos-host-no-2-ucla-after-delay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50361\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/gauchos-host-no-2-ucla-after-delay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/gauchos-host-no-2-ucla-after-delay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/gauchos-host-no-2-ucla-after-delay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/gauchos-host-no-2-ucla-after-delay/","id":4498,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4497,4496,4495],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"World Baseball Classic: MLB’s Friend or Foe?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Tired of watching meaningless spring training baseball games?

Me too. Good thing the 2013 World Baseball Classic begins this weekend. The first WBC was held in 2006 and was played every three years until 2009, when it switched to every four years. It was created in response to baseball being voted out of the Olympics in 2005.<br>\nThe WBC is a great event because it spreads the game of baseball to other parts of the world, gives the fans a chance to see great players who do not play in the MLB already and also gives the players the opportunity to represent their home countries. For example, the baseball world was largely unaware of players like Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish and Yoenis Cespedes until they were lighting up the WBC. Now they are all playing and succeeding in the MLB.<br>\nHowever, the WBC does have one big flaw. When baseball was an Olympic sport, only amateur players could participate. The WBC, on the other hand, has no restrictions on who can play. Here lies the predicament: If you were an owner of a MLB franchise, would you want one of your star players playing and possibly getting hurt in the WBC? You are paying this player a lot of money to win games and fill the seats at your stadium, not to play in an international tournament that has no bearing on the MLB season. Take the Milwaukee Brewers for example. They are sending 13 of their players to various teams in the WBC including their big league catcher Jonathan Lucroy, ace starting pitcher Yovani Gallardo and former MVP outfielder Ryan Braun. If those players come back worn out or injured, then their season and their financial investments would be in serious jeopardy.<br>\nIn the last two WBC tournaments, the extra games have had the most negative effects on the pitchers. At this time in Spring Training, the pitchers are beginning their throwing routines and side bullpen sessions in preparation for the upcoming season. The WBC, however, requires the pitchers to go out and pitch in real games with maximum effort when they would normally be easing into the heavy workload. This can cause strain and fatigue on a pitcher’s arm, which is exactly what all of the MLB teams who are signing the players’ paychecks do not want.<br>\nLooking at the groups, Pool A consists of Cuba, Japan, Brazil and China. Brazil and China are not big baseball countries so Cuba and Japan are pretty safe. Japan has won both of the previous two tournaments and Cuba always has a few star players who will eventually play in the MLB. Pool B is made up by Australia, Chinese Taipei, Korea and the Netherlands. Look for Korea to easily advance followed by a struggle for the second spot.<br>\nPool C is considered the power pool with the likes of the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Spain and Venezuela. The Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Puerto Rico all feature multiple major league stars like Robinson Cano, Carlos Beltran, Hanley Ramirez, Yadier Molina, Miguel Cabrera, Pablo Sandoval and many others.<br>\nThen there is Pool D with Canada, Italy, Mexico and the United States. The U.S. should easily win this pool followed by either Mexico or Canada. Groups A and B will begin pool play on March 2 followed by groups C and D starting on March 7.<br>\nThe top two teams from each group will advance to the second round, which will be held at the Marlins’ stadium in Miami and at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. The top four teams will then advance to the championship round hosted at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco.<br>\nHopefully the U.S. can bring the title home and back to the birthplace of baseball. But before you ask why the U.S. roster does not include every great American player like Justin Verlander, Mike Trout or Buster Posey, you must ask yourself: Would you rather see the U.S. win the WBC or see your favorite team open the season with a healthy roster?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of February 26th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50363\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50363\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/","id":4499,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[4498,4497,4496],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Approval of Measure E in November will bring the CSD into existence and approval of Measure F will implement a utility user tax, allowing the CSD to improve infrastructure and institute community policing among other functions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As outlined in AB 3, the CSD is to be governed by seven directors, five of whom are elected by Isla Vista voters. Four elected members are to serve four-year terms and one elected member serves for two years. For the inaugural election, however, two of the four-year seats will be two-year seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt, Bertrand, Jordan and Hedges intended to seek the Democratic endorsement early in the race. They already share the common endorsement of the Yes on E &amp; F campaign organizers Jonathan Abboud, Cameron Schunk, Darcel Elliot and Assemblymember Das Williams, who first introduced AB 3 in December 2014.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jacob Lebell, a member of the SB Democrats’ central committee, said Wednesday it would be “no surprise” for the party to endorse the four residents. The local party has “good relations” with Brandt, Bertrand, Jordan and Hedges and the Yes on E &amp; F organizers, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only other CSD candidate to seek the Democrats’ endorsement was Andrew Gabriel Pragin, whose intent was to gain the party’s backing in the competitive race for two temporary two-year positions. He is vying for a seat along with Jordan, Hedges and Michael Kile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Democratic Party basically controls all of the voter registration volunteering efforts in Isla Vista, and they control all of the slate materials that are passed out. They have huge resources to draw from,” Pragin said. Gaining the Democratic endorsement, he said, is also key to receiving future endorsements from “influential” organizations like the Sierra Club and the Santa Barbara Women’s Political Committee.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“The Democratic Party basically controls all of the voter registration volunteering efforts in Isla Vista, and they control all of the slate materials that are passed out.”</p>\n<p>— Andrew Gabriel Pragin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pragin and three of the four other “running mate” candidates met with local party officials Thursday at Pea Soup Andersen’s to undergo 15-minute interviews, which the party requires of candidates seeking endorsement. Jordan is currently out of town on a trip to Israel, and Elliott acted as her proxy.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the meeting, Pragin said he wanted the party officials to select him for his experience and “perspective” as a local volunteer, potentially selecting him over Jordan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I honestly want them to just look at my credentials, hear what I have to say and realize that they are under no obligation to accept the top-down Das Williams endorsement as their own,” Pragin said Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He did not receive the endorsement, however, and will now begin what he called the “uphill fight” to seek further endorsements. Daraka Larimore-Hall, the chair of SB Democrats, said the party’s priority was to endorse candidates who “believe in Isla Vista self-governance” and will ensure the success of the CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates Jay Freeman and Kile opted not to seek the Democratic endorsement. Unopposed in his bid for one of the four-year seats, Freeman said he has had problems with “the Democratic Party establishment” in recent years despite his aligning values.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kile said he is “turned off” to the Democratic Party entirely after being at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) as a Bernie Sanders delegate in July.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The two-party system is a system of false choice,” he said. “Being at the DNC, I got to see all of that fakeness in the Democratic Party from the highest level down.”</span></p>\n<p>The CSD board of directors candidates are running in a nonpartisan election, meaning their political affiliation will not be shown on the November ballot.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72356\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-02/i-v-csd-candidate-slate-receives-democratic-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72356\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-02/i-v-csd-candidate-slate-receives-democratic-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-02/i-v-csd-candidate-slate-receives-democratic-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-02/i-v-csd-candidate-slate-receives-democratic-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-02/i-v-csd-candidate-slate-receives-democratic-endorsement/","id":4500,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4499,4498,4497],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
