These aren’t the rap songs you’re used to hearing. They don’t flow the same way. They don’t announce themselves the same way. In the album’s introduction, the first thing you hear is James Baldwin saying,  “imprecise words.” While other rappers would like you to believe that they are masterful artists, that they have complete control over the English language and can say whatever they want to, however they want to, Earl Sweatshirt is upfront about not having found the right words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And he’s upfront about a lot more. Lead single “Nowhere2go” spotlights his depression and sugarcoats nothing. It’s a lot to take in. The beat ripples and surges; a wooden snare taps in between and over the top of waves of grumbling bass and stretched-out samples. The beat washes over and absorbs Earl, and he isn’t rapping so much as he’s delivering thoughts: “I think … I spent most of my life depressed / Only thing on my mind was death / Didn’t know if my time was next.” “Nowhere2go” has the formlessness you wouldn’t expect from a single. There’s no hook, no catchy refrain, no face-slapping ear-candy. Earl explains to Zane Lowe on Beats 1, “I’m not a single-ass n****, and it’s the closest thing that I got to a damn single.” There’s nothing to grab onto. Instead, the song grabs onto you. It’s the single that isn’t a single. Just like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some Rap Songs</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the title that isn’t a title.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the album that isn’t an album? Earl goes on, “I’m just trying to complete thought for myself, because them being unfinished is like, I don’t know, it can beget anxiety for me […],” which makes me think of a line of his off “The Bends” that goes “It’s real when you seal up letters with wax” and how these songs can be thought of as letters, personal outpourings, therapeutic exercises </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not necessarily meant to be sent or seen. What really matters is that the thoughts are finished and sealed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that his feelings are generally addressed rather than addressed to anyone in particular.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, sometimes, someone in particular is graffitied in big block letters across the face of the building. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing Possum</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> comes toward the end of the track listing, and it comes as a conciliatory tribute to his own mother, a UCLA law professor, and father, a South African poet who passed away earlier this year. Earl samples both of them on the track, alternating his mother’s keynote speech with a reading of his father’s poem </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anguish Longer Than Sorrow</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As his mother thanks Earl and sends him “a thousand kisses,” his father reads, “For some children, words like home could not carry any possible meaning.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in 2009, Earl’s mother sent him away for three years just as Odd Future was starting to make it big (see the “Free Earl” phenomenon) and, around this same time, his father walked out on both him and his mother. So, to say the least, Earl hasn’t always been happy with his parents. But he uses this opportunity to hear their side of it. His mother always loved him and wanted the best for him. His father concerned himself with the trauma of the world’s forgotten children and along the way forgot his own child. “To have a home is not a favor,” he reads. His anxious American child doesn’t want to harbor resentment. He wants to celebrate his parents. Earl wants to make peace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, Earl Sweatshirt’s third studio album is rainy-day rap music. Its slurred and off-kilter beats loop well with the rhythm of raindrops. Mood replaces structure. Even raindrops would be just another element that seems to swallow Earl whole. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some Rap Songs</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is best listened to when rained-in, on the perfect days for word-parsing and meditation. This album is a stroll through the storm, all the way to the other side.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85756\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/in-review-some-rap-songs-by-earl-sweatshirt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85756\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/in-review-some-rap-songs-by-earl-sweatshirt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/in-review-some-rap-songs-by-earl-sweatshirt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/in-review-some-rap-songs-by-earl-sweatshirt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/in-review-some-rap-songs-by-earl-sweatshirt/","id":6615,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[6614,6613,6612],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt","biography":"Not available","articles":[5610,6582,6615,6657,6676,6679,6868],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Your New Best “Twen”: Noontime Jamming Beneath Storke","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2019-03-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Unknown.jpeg?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Unknown.jpeg?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1","description":"With humble beginnings on the East Coast, Twen released their first album, Twen Live, in March 2017, which is comprised of five vintage-feeling tracks.

Boston’s underground indie-pop group “Twen” added a lucky stop to their tour right here at UCSB’s campus. Following A.S. Program Board’s semi-weekly Noon Storke Shows, the alternative bunch invaded the courtyard, rocking raw, melodious beats and enticing a crowd whose energy swept through campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With humble beginnings on the East Coast, Twen released their first album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twen Live</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in March 2017, which is comprised of five vintage-feeling tracks. The band consists of lead singers Jane Fitzsimmons and Ian Jones, along with Cory Best on bass and Jeff Crenshaw on drums. Performing at South by Southwest this coming week, the band is definitely on the rise out of their Boston basement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the quaint stage nestled between Storke Tower and its steps, Twen assembled their garage band setup. A few cymbal clanks and a strum of a guitar enticed a small crowd that swarmed a table filled with KIND Bars and Yerba Mates. But the free, health-conscious snacks weren’t the only reason for their arrival; loud and proud, the band launched into a groovy song that had everyone’s heads swaying. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The third performance in the set, “Damsel,” which is about “figuring things out,” was a total crowd pleaser, roping in more wanderers to the Storke steps. As they reached the last guitar strum, Jones apologized for the exhaustion as they had just driven up from San Diego earlier that morning. They made quite the trek — from Boston to San Diego to Santa Barbara — for us Gauchos. This fatigue was hardly noticed as they continued on with their energetic set. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did I mention the crowd yet? It was almost unbelievable: The age groups spanned from professors to an actual toddler, and everyone absolutely loved it. One woman’s baby in a stroller was actually fist pumping throughout the set. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few music-admiring Gauchos gave their input on the show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hadn’t heard of them before, but I’ll check them out after. They really brought a unique sound to Santa Barbara” said Hannah Ford-Monroe, a second-year film and art double major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the concerts around town brought mostly “surf rock, so this was a nice change of pace,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the supply of Yerba Mattes depleted, the show continued with the same intensity as its start. Besides a brief moment for the band to discuss the “polar vortex” SoCal has been in and the lengthiness of their tour, Twen only had high spirits that echoed throughout the crowd. Jones was sure to remind us that our “glory days in college are numbered,” so we might as well enjoy every moment. And many did that day as they embraced Twen’s music in all its live, sun-filled glory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the euphoric set was limited to one midday hour, modern technology allows us to jam to Twen at all times.

Hub at UCSB last year. Both times he has been nothing short of extremely fun – jumping around stage with his quirky sound and dancing to his intensely upbeat music. Smino continues to exemplify his playful tone with his latest album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NOIR </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and every time I listen to a song I reminisce about the memory of him bouncing around the stage and illuminating his audience through his perplexing voice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first time I listened to the album I was almost confused by its idiosyncratic collection of songs. However, the lack of cohesiveness of the album was surprisingly addictive. The distinct sounds of both the beat and the lyrics of each song were atypical, especially as one piece. However, they still flowed together and the stylistic choices created a natural movement between each song.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The St. Louis-born rapper collaborated with his usual producer, Monte Booker, on this project and created a masterpiece embodied by casual yet fun tunes. Smino successfully tackles a different niche of hip-hop by making it quirky yet smooth with his soft vocals combined with his raspy sounds. His very artistic approach to music distinguishes his music type from that of others in the genre.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Monte Booker is the genius behind the beats, Smino further proves to be the perfect match with his bright vocals and impressive lyricism. Smino represents creativity in its essence. As you listen to the album’s songs one by one, each has a completely different sound but the amalgamation of all creates a triumphant piece of art. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Songs such as “KLINK” and “PIZANO” introduce high energy sounds while songs such as “MF GROOVE,” “SPINZ” and “MERLOT” slow it back down and make you want to listen on repeat for hours. What stuck out to me were the cuts “TEQUILA MOCKINGBIRD” and “KRUSHED ICE,” which offer sounds that are dissimilar from Smino’s earlier music. “TEQUILA MOCKINGBIRD” is a simple and fun approach to his story of a girl with high energy and bounce of the drums that alludes to an earlier Smino song, “Anita.” Despite his musical progression with this album, Smino includes songs reminiscent of his debut LP </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blkswn </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with the smooth funky tunes found in “KOVERT” and “MERLOT.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smino’s vocals in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NOIR </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are something only a professional could achieve; the dexterity of notes he hits is truly exceptional. While he has this amazing voice, he doesn’t stop there, using adlibs, shrieks and strange words to make it even more dynamic and inventive. Smino’s individuality separates him from other hip-hop artists as he combines multiple genres and sounds to create a new space in the genre. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he keeps a cool, not-so-serious vibe throughout the album, Smino still incorporates impressive lyricism through his bars. He changes his tone from feminine to masculine between songs, representing his ability to play on different emotions and create a variety of atmospheres. The versatility of his lyrics are also distinct, as he tells short stories of little importance yet cultivated and interesting rhythmic landscape.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The originality of this album distinguishes Smino from so many others. The eclectic sounds, also thanks to Monte Booker, makes a fun and detailed playlist. Smino enters a new field of hip-hop, the whole album playful to the point where you can imagine him having fun while making this music. As </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NOIR </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is only Smino’s second album, his stylistic development and pivot from his previous music differentiates him as more than a one-hit wonder. His new take on rap expressed through exceptional artistic qualities makes this album one to remember. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although new Smino listeners may be unimpressed by the uncanny composition of different types of music, the stylistic choices Smino made represents the mastery of his understanding of hip-hop and the desire to express his own inventiveness while simply having fun.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In 2018, artists broke down their own personal barriers to share full-length declarations of love, loss and struggle – showing both depth and versatility. Upon weeks of reflection, and the start of the new year, here are 10 of the best albums of the year.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Room 25</em> by Noname</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Room 25 is an extremely conscientious record where Noname toys with soulful sounds and finds a newfound elegance. She manages to find great power in nimble basslines and gentle string sections that support the exploration of her confidence as a young, black woman. The instrumentals are refined enough to create a wonderful flow, but not to the point where they lose their natural groove. This really is a soothing album that makes well-needed admissions to the struggles in creativity for rappers – which are often times brought upon by racial tension.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Die Lit</em> by Playboi Carti</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While it was largely overlooked by self-proclaimed hip-hop connoisseurs, Playboi Carti’s sophomore album Die Lit is a generational landmark in trap music. The rapper’s ingenious adlib repetition along with the hypnotic production is a high point in this a new wave of refined rap minimalism. Filled with countless bangers and trap lullabies, Die Lit garnered a subtle buzz from fans all year. It’s an addictive project, to say the least.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Sweetener</em> by Ariana Grande</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ariana Grande is one of – if not the – biggest name in pop right now. Though she struggled with major tragedies and losses in love, she takes these moments and fuses them together to deliver a cohesive package of eccentric pop ballads. Beds of lavish and elegant strings serve to make Grande’s voice voluminous and powerful unlike ever before. A skilled hand from legendary producer Pharrell helps Grande convey her fragmented emotions through spectacular vocals.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Wide Awake!</em> by Parquet Courts</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wide Awake! Is a testament to the music world that punk and underground hardcore are everlasting scenes, which can be just as powerful as they were in decades past. Parquet Courts shifts punk into a new gear and gives listeners a mixed bag of accentuated riffs alongside incredible bass lines that elevate the grunge aesthetic. The band uses hints of nostalgia in a true rock-and-roll fashion.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>7</em> by Beach House</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dedicated to the indie population, 7 encapsulates Beach House’s best transcription of musical emotions. The duo spins dreamy synths and rock instrumentals to dazzle listeners from track to track, while the album progresses in an immaculate motion. Beach House comes through with a refreshing level of experimentation that sculpts together a new sound which establishes them as progressive innovators.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Daytona</em> by Pusha T</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">G.O.O.D Music rapper Pusha T has had an eventful year, partly due to the fact that he has been in a back-and-forth battle with music industry Goliath, Drake. Nevertheless, his choice of battle is what makes Pusha T so undeniably addictive to listen to and in Daytona, an entirely Kanye West-produced project, Pusha T continues to prove just how ruthless he is. Throughout the seven-song tracklist Pusha T utilizes his nonstop arrogance in order to fine-tune a flow that makes his dark voice intoxicating. On Daytona, we are given unmerciful bars that solidify Pusha T as a menace of the rap game that should not be battled with.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Isolation</em> by Kali Uchis</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following her well-rounded record Por Vida in 2015, centered around eclectic jams, Kali Uchis has delivered the quintessential pop fantasy album Isolation. Uchis takes listeners through a surreal rollercoaster that travels through some of the most luxurious and gloomiest of landscapes. The sensual singer unravels a variety of emotions that glide along effortlessly. Isolation consist of dreamy melodies that accents Uchis’s angelic vocals perfectly with a level of versatility that brings her into the spotlight.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Some Rap Songs</em> by Earl Sweatshirt</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through excellent lyricism and a unique discography with complex wordplay, Odd Future native Earl Sweatshirt has earned himself a spot in the top list of current generation rappers. As his career progresses, his music takes a darker, lo-fi approach. This is exemplified throughout his flow in Some Rap Songs, which remains top tier as per usual but becomes much more experimental with jazzy, minimalistic production. Some Rap Songs is an inward-looking compilation of work, which allows listeners to explore just exactly what is going on through the mind of Earl Sweatshirt.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Kids See Ghosts</em> by Kids See Ghosts </strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After months of speculation and isolating himself in Wyoming, in a matter of two weeks, Kanye West provided a back-to-back delivery of two impeccable projects which continue to solidify his instinctive production and masterful flow. On Ye, we are given a version of Kanye unlike those of the past. He dabbles in a diabolical approach that taps into some of his innermost demons. West explores his relationship with himself, allowing us to see a more vulnerable side. On Kids See Ghosts, the self-titled collaborative effort between West and Kid Cudi, West brings out an energy from Cudi unlike any other. Both Cudi and West play over West’s production of monstrous samples with triumphant delivery – capturing yet another monumental project in the career of the two rappers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>Negro Swan</em> by Blood Orange</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blood Orange is an artistic effort created by the singer-songwriter Devonté Hynes. On his most recent project, Negro Swan, we are given a side of Hynes that shows his multifaceted ability to tell complex narratives and reincarnate tender sounds which are culturally significant and impactful for the black community. Hynes has shined throughout the years by lending his songwriting abilities to big name artist such as Solange, FKA Twigs and even A$AP Rocky. This time, he has used his impeccable ear for pop and songwriting abilities to create a project of his own. Negro Swan works to give people a collection of beautiful harmonies and sensual grooves that define Hynes as a sonically driven artist.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85509\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/artsweeks-ten-favorite-albums-of-2018/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85509\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/artsweeks-ten-favorite-albums-of-2018/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/artsweeks-ten-favorite-albums-of-2018/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/artsweeks-ten-favorite-albums-of-2018/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/artsweeks-ten-favorite-albums-of-2018/","id":6614,"author":{"id":691,"name":"Antonio Morales"},"related":[6613,6612,6611],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
