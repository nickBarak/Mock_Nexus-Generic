Santa Barbara is currently tied with UC Riverside for third place in the league standings. Hawaii lost its fourth-straight game, and is now 8-15 and 4-7 in conference play for seventh place.</p>\n<p>In what was just her second career 20-point game, Edelman got off to a quick start, scoring four of the Gauchos’ six points to begin the game.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting 30 percent or below – 28.6 percent on a 4-of-14 finish – form behind the three-point line for the fourth consecutive game, redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter began the first period hot from long range.</p>\n<p>Porter went a perfect 3-of-3 shooting in the first quarter. Her three makes from beyond the arc were her only field goals for the night as she ended the game with nine points on 3-of-10 overall, 3-of-7 three-point shooting. Her three-point make with 29 second remaining in the period gave UCSB a 20-12 lead.</p>\n<p>Both junior guard Sarah Toeaina and freshman forward Keleah-Aiko Koloi managed to keep Hawaii within close distance of UCSB’s lead with four points apiece.</p>\n<p>Just like Hawaii’s first meeting against the Gauchos, Toeaina led the Rainbow Wahine in scoring again with 19 points on a 8-of-15 performance from the field. Koloi concluded the game without a miss, going 3-of-3 shooting and for six points in eight minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos first double-figure lead of 22-12 occurred as a result of a made layup by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe in the first minute of the second quarter. Jemerigbe had a competent night with 10 points on 4-of-9 shooting along with three steals.</p>\n<p>Two quick three-point makes by freshman guard Julissa Tago and sophomore forward Leah Salanoa cut the Gauchos’ lead to 25-18.</p>\n<p>Each time Hawaii managed to score a basket, UCSB responded with points of its own to maintain a lead. Most notably, UCSB held the Rainbow Wahine to just nine points in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Following a 30 second timeout, the Gauchos completely controlled the final five minutes of the period to enter halftime on a 9-1 run. Beginning with a made jumpshot by Jemerigbe, at the core of Santa Barbara’s run was junior forward Chaya Durr with four points. Durr ended the game with six points, five rebounds, and one steal as she helped UCSB enter halftime with a 36-21 lead.</p>\n<p>In spite of the large deficit, Hawaii was a different team coming into the second half. The Rainbow Wahine replied to the Gauchos’ closing run with a 12-3 run in the opening minutes of the third, forcing UCSB to call a timeout as its lead was trimmed to 39-31.</p>\n<p>As Hawaii outscored UCSB 18-13 in the period, leading the team’s comeback was Toeaina, scoring 10 of her 19 points. Her efficient shot selection of driving to the basket for layups in addition to her mid-range shooting allowed Hawaii to come within its closest deficit of the game at 41-37.</p>\n<p>But, the Rainbow Wahine defense could not stop the steady shooting of UCSB, who earned a 10-point lead 49-39 to end the quarter after a made three-pointer by freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez.</p>\n<p>Unable to disrupt UCSB’s rhythmic shooting night, Hawaii never overcame its double-figure deficit.</p>\n<p>Guiding the Gauchos to their fourth road win of the season was the fourth quarter play of both Edelman and redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>The two combined for 14 points in the last 10 minutes of regulation. After a quiet first three quarters, scoring just four points, Toler’s 3-of-3 shooting in the fourth was essential to UCSB closing the game.</p>\n<p>Playing all 10 minutes of the period, the elusive guard was responsible for all eight of the Gauchos’ points in the final 2 and a half minutes of the game. She was effective in both penetrating and finishing at the rim as well as at the free-throw line where she went 4-of-6 on the night.</p>\n<p>Toler led all bench players in scoring with 12 points as she went 4-of-6 from the field, helping UCSB lock up its victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its road leg of games, resuming play this Thursday, Feb. 16 at UC Riverside at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75680\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75680\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-tied-for-third-after-earning-season-sweep-of-hawaii/","id":471,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[470,469,468],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Outhustled by CSUN in 62-55 Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-09-at-1.01.22-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-09-at-1.01.22-PM.png?resize=980%2C608&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team lost its second consecutive home game Thursday night after being defeated by Cal State Northridge.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There was no benefit to its homecourt advantage once again as the UCSB women’s basketball team was defeated by Cal State Northridge 62-55 Wednesday night at the Thunderdome.

It’s the fourth time in five games that the Gauchos have shot below 30 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Now on a two-game losing streak, the Gauchos fall to fourth in the Big West standings at 11-12, 6-4. Just one conference win away from tying UCSB, CSUN won its fourth-straight to improve to 12-11 and 5-4.</p>\n<p>It was an undisciplined start for UCSB’s offense in the opening minutes of Thursday’s game as the Gauchos had three turnovers in their first five possessions.</p>\n<p>While UCSB dealt with miscues, CSUN gradually established a rhythm that led to its 7-0 run and lead.</p>\n<p>Beginning with sophomore center Channon Fluker and ending with a three-point make by junior guard Serafina Maulpe, the Matadors seemed to be on their way to repeating their 48 percent shooting percentage in the first meeting.</p>\n<p>Maulupe finished with a game-high 22 points, 17 of which she scored in the first half.</p>\n<p>Yet, halting CSUN’s run was the subbing in of redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler at the 6:32 mark as she served as the catalyst to the Gauchos’ 8-0 run. She scored a team-high 12 points, a game-high six assists, and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>The string of points began with Toler grabbing a defensive rebound, then driving coast-to-coast for the foul and score before converting at the free-throw line to score the team’s first field goal of the game. A made layup freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez gave UCSB its first lead of the game of 12-11.</p>\n<p>The Matadors regained their lead of 12-11 as a result of a made free-throw by Maulupe. With the shot clock off, CSUN ended the first period with a 14-11 lead after a spin and layup by freshman guard Hayley Tanabe.</p>\n<p>UCSB found itself on the downside of a run once again in the opening minutes of the second quarter as CSUN put together a 9-2 run, in which Maulupe scored seven points during the stretch. Scoring points both in the lane and from behind the perimeter, CSUN’s all-around scorer handed the Matadors their first double –figure lead of the game of 23-13.</p>\n<p>Despite inconsistencies from beyond the arc, UCSB had some peak moments along the perimeter. Knocking down some major deep shots were both Redshirt sophomore guard Sarah Porter and freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez with back-to-back three-pointers to decrease the team’s lead to four 23-19.</p>\n<p>Porter recorded 10 points on 4-of-10 shooting, 2-of-7 from long range. Hernandez nearly posted a similar outcome with eight points while finishing 3-of-9 and 2-of-7 from three-point land.</p>\n<p>Providing hustle off the bench was junior forward Taylor Farris, scoring UCSB’s final two field goals of the half with a baseline floater and jumper. In 16 minutes of play, Farris had six points and three rebounds on 3-of-8 shooting.</p>\n<p>As the Gauchos inched closer and closer to trimming their deficit, CSUN would respond each time.</p>\n<p>Quietly emerging for CSUN with a perfect 4-of-4, 2-of-2 three-point shooting performance was senior guard Emily Cole. It was her two made three-pointers in the final three minutes of the first half that curtailed UCSB’s momentum, as one of her deep range makes allowed the Matadors to enter halftime with a 33-25 lead.</p>\n<p>The exchange of baskets between both teams continued in the third quarter as CSUN maintained a lead of at least seven points for the entire period.</p>\n<p>After coming up empty-handed in its first two possessions of the second half, a drive and drawing of a foul by senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe gave the Gauchos life despite her being unable to convert at the free-throw line as UCSB would trail 33-27. Jemerigbe tallied six points and three assists.</p>\n<p>Maulupe and Cole were the Matadors’ source of offense in the third, combining for nine points on 4-of-7 shooting.</p>\n<p>Entering down nine points 46-37, the fourth quarter turned out to be the Gauchos most productive quarter as they honed in scoring the ball to amass a 10-3 run during the period.</p>\n<p>Their defense played a critical role in the stretch of points as they held CSUN to just one point in the first three and half minutes of the final period.</p>\n<p>The peak of UCSB’s run began with a three-point make by sophomore guard Coco Miller, who brought the Gauchos closer to Northridge’s lead 49-44. Miller concluded Thursday with seven points as her only two field goals in the game were from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Following Miller’s make was the Gauchos’ press defense which forced CSUN into a 30-second shot clock violation with 5:18 remaining in the game. Porter would then hit a three-pointer to bring UCSB within a two-point deficit of 49-47.</p>\n<p>Yet, overshadowing UCSB’s comeback effort was Fluker’s outburst of 13 fourth quarter points. In addition to going 3-for-6 from the field in the quarter, the star center was most proactive in earning 14 free-throw attempts, making half of them.</p>\n<p>A rebound and putback score by Fluker put CSUN up 51-47. UCSB continued to chase the Matadors’ lead but could never fully contain their hustle on the boards which led to various trips to the free-throw line and a loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begins its four-game road trip this Saturday, Jan. 11 at Hawaii at 7 p.m. at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

It seemed like the UCSB women’s basketball team had everything fall into place for the first time this season, holding a nine point lead with 4:32 remaining against UC Davis. However, a 12-0 run by the Aggies help send the game into overtime where they went on to defeat the Gauchos 60-54.</p>\n<p>With another loss to UC Irvine just two days earlier, UCSB now falls to 0-20 for the year and 0-7 in conference play. Both the Anteaters and the Aggies fell to Cal Poly over the weekend, but Irvine was able to pick up its first conference win of the year to move to 4-18 overall, 1-6 Big West. Davis is now 9-10 overall, 4-3 Big West.</p>\n<p>“It’s very easy at their age to want to throw the towel in,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We may be the only 16 people in here that believe that it’s going to get turned around, but all you can do is keep jabbing away.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although UCSB has played its best prolonged stretch of basketball over the past three games, it has faltered down the stretch of each of them. This was on display most against Davis, when the Gauchos did something they hadn’t done all year by taking a sizable lead into the final minutes.</p>\n<p>After a pair of free-throws by sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe gave UCSB a 45-36 lead with 4:32 to go, the Aggies took control. Two three-pointers by Kelsey Harris helped cut the lead to one before a layup by Celia Marfone with 1:48 remaining gave Davis its first lead since very early in the first half.</p>\n<p>“They changed up their defense,” Mitchell said. “We had a decent rhythm going up against their 3-2. They went to a half-court trap and we had a couple of turnovers against it that made us lose our rhythm.”</p>\n<p>Trailing by three in the final seconds of regulation, the Gauchos looked to free up freshman guard Makala Roper. After being unable to find anywhere to go with the ball, Jemerigbe took the game into her own hands, stepping back to fire a deep three, her only attempt of the game, which miraculously went in to tie it at 48-48 and send the game into overtime.</p>\n<p>“I knew we needed a three,” Jemerigbe said. “The confidence that the team had in me willed me to make it. I just got out there and knocked it down with confidence.”</p>\n<p>With all the momentum on its side, UCSB was unable to outplay the Aggies in the back-and-forth extra session. A three-point play by Jemerigbe and a three-pointer from Roper helped keep the game close at 54-56, but the Gauchos went 0-3 from the field with two turnovers in the final 48 seconds as they fell, 60-54.</p>\n<p>Harris led the way for Davis with 19 points on 5-10 from downtown, while Jemerigbe put in a team-high 14 points to go along with six assists. Jemerigbe leads the Big West with 5.6 assists per game during conference play.</p>\n<p>The game also marked the first time in Mitchell’s four years as head coach that the Gauchos have gone to overtime.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s game against Irvine similarly went down to the wire, as UCSB overcame a 10-point second half deficit to cut the lead to one. A jumper by senior center Clair Watkins made it 39-38 with just over a quarter of the game remaining. However, that was the closest Santa Barbara would get.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Jasmine Ware put in a career-high 21 points on 10-19 shooting, but it wasn’t enough as the Anteaters converted from the line down the stretch, eventually winning 61-58.</p>\n<p>After another winless weekend, Mitchell had one message to give to her team.</p>\n<p>“Do not give up,” Mitchell said. “March Madness, last time I heard you win 3 or 4 or 5 in a row and you’re dancing so we’ll keep that mindset.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will head on the road this weekend for a single game against Hawaii on Thursday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60420\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/miracle-shot-sends-ucsb-to-ot-gauchos-remain-winless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60420\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/miracle-shot-sends-ucsb-to-ot-gauchos-remain-winless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/miracle-shot-sends-ucsb-to-ot-gauchos-remain-winless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/miracle-shot-sends-ucsb-to-ot-gauchos-remain-winless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/miracle-shot-sends-ucsb-to-ot-gauchos-remain-winless/","id":469,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[468,467,466],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Losing Woes Continue After Loss to CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-13-at-2.11.17-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-13-at-2.11.17-PM.png?resize=980%2C602&ssl=1","description":"Still winless on the road, now 0-11, the UCSB men's basketball team has loss eight consecutive games after enduring another blowout defeat to Cal State Northridge.

UCSB finally found its stride toward the end of the first half, and although they were not quite able to shut down CSUN’s lead, the Gauchos were able to greatly reduce it.</p>\n<p>Dawson led the Matadors during the first half in both points at 10 with a field goal percentage of 80 percent and eight rebounds. Childress was keeping the Gauchos afloat, scoring 13 in the first half, adding to UCSB’s three-point field goal percentage of 57.1.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho starters were working hard to make plays happen along with freshman guard Max Heidegger, who has proven to be the source of many Gaucho points this season. In the last 1:05 of the half, both teams pushed to score as much as possible, with UCSB gaining four points and CSUN gaining three, making it a close game of 34-31 at the end of the first period.</p>\n<p>Although during the first half it may have seemed as though the Gauchos might be able to come back, nothing about the second half sent that same message. UCSB starter junior forward Alex Hart scored twice in the first two minutes for the half, but a jumpshot from Matador freshman center Mahamadou Kaba-Camara sent the Gauchos into a four-minute dry spell.</p>\n<p>Even though UCSB was still trailing, the team managed to keep the lead small until the sixth minute when Northridge had crept up to a 10-point lead. Between senior guards Kendall Smith, Darin Johnson, Aaron Parks and junior guard Michael Warren, the Gauchos did not stand a chance.</p>\n<p>With Heidegger and Childress carrying the bulk of the Gaucho points, it is no surprise that UCSB lost when four out of CSUN’s five starters scored a minimum 12 points each.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ loose ends were unfortunately on display during the second half, especially in comparison to the Matadors’ clean and high level of play. In just the second half, UCSB had only one steal from Childress and caused seven turnovers, giving the Matadors unnecessary opportunities to score. CSUN, on the other hand, only caused three turnovers and managed to snag five steals. Little details such as these do in fact make a difference, as UCSB saw this weekend.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were making baskets all of the way until the end of the game; they were just unable to make them at the same speed as the Matadors. All season, UCSB has had the same huge problem: shooting and scoring. The team is able to get tons of shots off, but the shots are just not making it into the basket. Although effort does count for a lot, in this game, accuracy counts more.</p>\n<p>Now sitting at the very bottom of the conference, the UCSB Gauchos have five games left until the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Desperately hoping to end their eight-game losing streak, the Gauchos will take on the University of Hawaii at the Thunderdome on Thursday, Feb. 16 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75666\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-losing-woes-continue-after-loss-to-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75666\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-losing-woes-continue-after-loss-to-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-losing-woes-continue-after-loss-to-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-losing-woes-continue-after-loss-to-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-losing-woes-continue-after-loss-to-csun/","id":470,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[469,468,467],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
