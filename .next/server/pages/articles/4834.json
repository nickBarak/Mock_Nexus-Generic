The standing-room-only crowd had an electric atmosphere throughout, as these top-five water polo juggernauts faced off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kicking things off in the first, USC jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead after Trojan’s Matt Maier and Hannes Daube found the back of the net. The Gauchos would not take long to respond as seniors Jacob Halle and Ivan Gvozdanovic evened things up after ripping off a goal a piece in merely 30 seconds of play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once things were tied up, USC’s Jacob Mercep rallied off two goals by himself to regain the lead for the Trojans, now up 4-2. Just before the end of the first, a missed outside shot bounced off the post and landed right into USC’s Matt Maier’s lap, where he would draw an easy penalty. With three seconds left in the first, UCSB’s goalie, Danny Roland, would come up huge to stuff the Trojan penalty. After the first quarter, USC had the 4-2 advantage over the Gauchos. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second quarter saw a complete shift in momentum, as UCSB began to lock up the Trojan’s offense. After several saves by Danny Roland and numerous Gaucho field blocks, the UCSB attack began to flourish. The Gaucho’s would go on to score three unanswered goals, claiming a 5-4 lead late in the second. USC would eventually respond with their only goal of the quarter, making this one knotted up at five each going into the half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half was tight throughout, as goals went back and forth. In the third, we saw two huge goals by Ivan Gvozdanovic, who had a really efficient game. Gvozdanovic lead the Gaucho’s in scoring with four goals in the contest. The offense was clicking for UCSB, but each time Santa Barbara saw a slight lead, it was erased by Trojan goals. After three, the game was tied at eight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final period began with a bang, as several really quick goals were scored. USC’s Jacob Mercep scored on the first possession of the quarter and UCSB’s Leo Yuno would come back with a beautiful strike of his own on a powerplay. After Yuno’s goal, Jake Ehrhardt of USC would score with six minutes and 48 seconds left to recapture the lead. After those initial goals, the offense for both teams would stall dramatically. The fourth period turned out to be very physical as both teams ramped up their defenses and held each other scoreless. This one finished with No. 5 USC upsetting No. 4 UCSB, 10-9.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s next game will be against UCLA this Friday, Oct. 11 at Spieker Aquatic Center. The game will kick off at 7 p.m. If you can’t travel to support your Gauchos, tune into TheFosh.net for live stats. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90278\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/no-4-ucsb-mens-water-polo-falls-to-no-5-usc-for-first-home-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90278\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/no-4-ucsb-mens-water-polo-falls-to-no-5-usc-for-first-home-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/no-4-ucsb-mens-water-polo-falls-to-no-5-usc-for-first-home-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/no-4-ucsb-mens-water-polo-falls-to-no-5-usc-for-first-home-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/no-4-ucsb-mens-water-polo-falls-to-no-5-usc-for-first-home-loss/","id":4834,"author":{"id":358,"name":"Jesse Morrison"},"related":[4833,4832,4831],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":358,"name":"Jesse Morrison","biography":"Not available","articles":[4834,4840,4841,4845,4850,4860,4868,4869,5672,5680,5683,5684,5686,5687,5688,5689,5690,5693,5697,5700],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Letter From the Editor: Merk’s Paradise","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2018-06-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/34509119_1828549473869117_1321158792385134592_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/34509119_1828549473869117_1321158792385134592_n.jpg?resize=960%2C640&ssl=1","description":"New Editor-in-Chief Jorge Mercado introduces himself and examines the past three years in college, and the nexus, that has led him to this point.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hello everybody!

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let’s start with the hard stuff. What does this mean for you the student? I am the first EIC in a long time that has come from the sports section. Because of that, I want to bring more variety to this paper and have a lot more feature-style content across all sections to help all of you students feel more connected to this paper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think we do a good job of being the voice for students, but I know we can do even better. Each and every one of you on campus has a story, so come to share it with us. Every single voice at UCSB is vital to that change, and, as editor in chief, it is my top priority to incorporate your voices into our journalism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also hope to expand our outreach and find new and creative ways to reach out to students, whether that be through podcasts or another medium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, however, I want our reporting to stay as great as it has been. We are a newspaper and we are journalists and it is our job to bring you the truth. In a time where “fake news” is as prevalent as hopefully, it will ever be, we want to be a trusted outlet that you can rely on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That doesn’t mean we are perfect. We will make mistakes. We will publish things that not everyone will agree with. This is what comes with being in this business. But know that every single thing we do, we do it because we believe it is the right thing to do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, really quickly, I’d love to take the time by saying how much I love The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining this college newspaper has easily been the best decision of my life. I can honestly say that after three years of college, I would not be who I am right now had I not joined the paper — and most would say I am a pretty pleasant person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For as long as I can remember, sports was always at the forefront of my mind. I loved to play. But after not being blessed with tremendous stature, my hopes of ever playing football at a D-I level were never going to happen, so I decided to write about sports instead!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, only I would have been dumb enough to pick a school that doesn’t have a football team, considering it is my favorite sport, but I think everything worked out all right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better than that though are the people. Everyone I have ever met here has been so kind and wonderful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a better part of two years, I worked with Sean White, as we were both sports editors, and it was the best experience of my life. Usually working with people sucks — we all hate group projects — but working with Sean was incredibly easy. We knew our goal was to grow the section and I think we did that. I wish him the best as he prepares to graduate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as important are the three ladies that came before me in this position, Megan Mineiro, Supriya Yelimeli and Maura Fox. I have nothing but respect and admiration for these women listed. If you want to meet kind, hardworking, talented people, then they are perfect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three did tremendous things as EIC, not just making sure this place stayed afloat but rather shifting their attention to making this paper the best it can be. I would love to tell you more about each one of them because they are so special, but I only have so much space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is because of them that I am confident in stepping into this role. Three years ago all I wanted to do was write about sports — I never even thought about running for EIC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as I kept growing up, kept learning from these ladies, in particular, I realized my heart was not just in sports, it was in this paper as a whole. I love every single person at the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the fact I am leading it means the world to me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you ever have any concerns, questions or honestly just want to chat, please feel free to come to talk to me.

prepare for their last Big West doubleheader and pair of regular season matches. First, they’ll travel south to Northridge, where UCSB will face off against CSUN. Next, another installment of the Blue-Green rivalry is in store as the team travels north to Cal Poly this weekend.</p>\n<p>Last week was full of emotion as Gaucho seniors Ar’mond Davis, Ami Lakoju, Jarriesse Blackmon and Maxwell Kupchak were all honored at the Thunderdome’s Senior Night, last Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB was looking to do the double over Long Beach State, whom they had bested on the road about a month prior. Unfortunately, the seniors weren’t able to be sent off on a win as the Gauchos fell just short by a score of 69-64. Still, fans and players alike applauded the seniors’ contributions throughout their time here at Santa Barbara.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As it stands, the Gauchos hold an overall record of 19-9 on the season, equaling a win percentage of .679. With men’s basketball for the month of February now in the books, UCSB finished with an evenly split performance of 4-4 through the eight Big West Conference matchups they faced.</p>\n<p>With the postseason’s Big West Tournament just on the horizon, seeding could still be shaken up as the standings still remain unsecure. Following last week’s play, UC Irvine have now locked in their place as Big West Conference regular season champions.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos still have a shot at second place in the league if results go in their favor. Cal State Fullerton, whom the Gauchos beat at their home but lost to at the Thunderdome earlier in the season, currently holds second overall with a conference record of 10-5. Meanwhile, the Gauchos remain in third with an 8-6 conference record of their own, although a top-three finish isn’t guaranteed for Santa Barbara as Hawaii, CSUN, UC Davis and Long Beach State all trail closely behind by only a single win difference.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s opponents in CSUN are in fine form, as the Matadors are in the midst of a win streak. After losing away at Long Beach State by just a bucket a couple of weeks ago, CSUN has since gone back-to- back-to-back with a trio of wins against UC Davis, UC Riverside and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>The Matadors still hold an overall record of 13-17 on the season, a .433 win percentage, but they’ll still be hungry to move up the conference ladder come game time.</p>\n<p>Historically speaking, the Gauchos lead the two teams’ all-time series at a record of 38-19, with the last meeting resulting in a 70-64 home victory for UCSB early last month.</p>\n<p>As for Blue-Green rival Cal Poly, the Mustangs have been looking the worse for wear as of late. With a 6-21 overall record on the season, Cal Poly also stands dead last in Big West standings with a conference record of 2-12. Not to mention, they’ve averaged 1.5 wins in every month of play this season. The Mustangs will be coming off a most recent 94-85 road loss to Long Beach State, as UCSB will want to complete the clean sweep over their rivals this weekend.</p>\n<p>This will be the 115th time the Gauchos have faced their familiar foes, as UCSB leads the all-time series at a record of 79-35. Last time out also resulted in a Gaucho win as UCSB opened this season’s conference campaign with a 65-56 home win over Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Amadou Sow is this week’s player to watch for the Gauchos. Sow will be coming off a most recent monster performance against Long Beach State, where his stat line ended at 13 points, 15 rebounds, three blocks and a pair of assists. With a great combination of height and strength, Sow’s added agility also makes him an excellent rim protector that enemy teams must script against.</p>\n<p>Two great forces will act opposite of each other as the Matadors also boast a big man prospect of their own in freshman forward Lamine Diane. Leading in total scoring for his side, Diane is also a block machine with 63 on the season. In addition, his 313 total rebounds make up almost a third of his team’s total rebounds; it’ll be wise for the Gauchos to not allow Diane his normal defensive production following tipoff.</p>\n<p>Once more, senior point guard Donovan Fields remains one of the few bright spots on Cal Poly’s season. Fields’s total of 451 points and 109 assists leads the Mustangs for the season. As the major driving force of Cal Poly’s offensive production, shutting Fields down will be key for another Gaucho win in the Blue-Green rivalry.</p>\n<p>All the action starts this Thursday, March 7, as UCSB heads south to CSUN for a 7 p.m. tipoff time. Then the Gauchos will head north to Cal Poly this Saturday, March 9, which is also set to begin at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the March 7, 2019 edition of the

shooting 9-14 on field goals and 6-6 from the stripe to lead LBSU to its third straight win.</p>\n<p>“They have the best guard in our league and I think you saw that tonight,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “We’re going to only go as far as our rebounding and defense takes us… we didn’t do that for 40 minutes tonight.”</p>\n<p>Booker surpassed the previous single season free throw record of 211 set by Fullerton Leon Wood in 1984 last week when he hit 10 from line to bring his season total to 216. Currently with 222 free throws this season, the record is rebranded by Booker and still growing.</p>\n<p>The 49ers got off to a 7-1 lead early on and remained ahead for the majority of the first half.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos kept it close with a couple swings and a pair of lead changes about ten minutes in, Beach caught fire behind a triad of triples from senior Bryan Alberts who contributed to a 9-0 run with 3:30 left in the first capped off by an Alberts’ assist and a slam by senior forward Mason Riggins to put State in the lead 30-19.</p>\n<p>Graduate guard Ar’mond Davis and the Gauchos inched closer at half time as Davis added six of his eight in the first half on 2-4 from three to bring SB within nine and cut the score to 34-25 at the break.</p>\n<p>Sophomore captain Devearl Ramsey opened up the second on an 8-0 tear by himself to close out the lead even more to 34-33 as the Gauchos looked poised to make a hearty comeback with the home crowd back into it.</p>\n<p>From there, Long Beach went blow-for-blow with UCSB, and although freshman forward Amadou Sow was getting everything he could in the paint, his points weren’t coming easily.</p>\n<p>Sow started shooting 5-5 from the field but ended with 13 points and a 6-11 slate on field goals. The Mali native dragged down a career-high 15 rebounds and dominated the post, but Beach produced through its guards, and Sow wasn’t positioned or assigned to stop them.</p>\n<p>Although momentum was fully in the favor of Long Beach State, the Gauchos took the lead 55-54 on a pair of Max Heidegger free throws with 6:15 left in the second, but Beach quickly scavenged back and took over once again.</p>\n<p>The Niner lead ballooned to seven with two minutes on the clock, but a five-point swing with a flush from senior Jarriesse Blackmon and a trey from Heidegger pulled the Gauchos within 62-60 with 1:15 left.</p>\n<p>At the line with 36 seconds on the game clock, sophomore Jordan Roberts missed a free throw that would have iced the game, but Beach corralled the miss and handed it back off to Roberts.</p>\n<p>“For each of the losses at home, it came down to one rebound,” Pasternack said. “We were down two, they got an offensive rebound. Against Irvine, we were up two, 36 seconds to go, they got an offensive rebound. Against UC Davis it was the same thing, they got an offensive rebound. We’re 14-4 right now when we out-rebound opponents and we didn’t do a good job on that tonight and it cost us the game.”</p>\n<p>Instead of the Gauchos fouling Roberts, a 51 percent free throw shooter, with 29 seconds on the clock, they waited for the sophomore to find Booker, a 90 percent free throw shooter, before committing a foul.</p>\n<p>Booker, arguably the best free throw shooter in Big West Conference history, was not the right guy to hack down the stretch as he put it away for Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s basketball team takes to the road for its final two games of the regular season as it heads to Northridge next Thursday, March 7, before traveling up to Cal Poly on March 9 for the next chapter of the Blue-Green Rivalry.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86597\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-03/niners-stun-santa-barbara-on-senior-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86597\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-03/niners-stun-santa-barbara-on-senior-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-03/niners-stun-santa-barbara-on-senior-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-03/niners-stun-santa-barbara-on-senior-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-03/niners-stun-santa-barbara-on-senior-night/","id":4833,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[4832,4831,4830],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
