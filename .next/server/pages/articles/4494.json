While road concerns have been a problem for Santa Barbara, the Gauchos have won both home games by an average margin of 18 points as they hope to continue the same trend tonight.</p>\n<p>“Right now, this young ball club hasn’t figured out to sustain when momentum starts against them on the road,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “At home, we haven’t had much of a problem with that — we’ve actually sustained pretty well.”</p>\n<p>Wyoming will try to win its seventh straight game tonight in an attempt to match its best start since the 1969-70 season. The Cowboys will embark on the road for only the second time this season, beating Northern Colorado 69-60 in their only other contest away from home. UCSB is certainly up to the challenge of facing an undefeated squad.</p>\n<p>“That adds a lot of motivation for us. We just want to go out and get that win even more now, break that run they’ve got,” freshman forward Taran Brown said. “We’re a lot more confident at home.”</p>\n<p>Brown has been on f ire for the Gauchos, averaging a team-high 15 points per game while second in rebounds with six. Williams, meanwhile, continues to be an imposing presence for Santa Barbara down low as he leads the team with over eight boards per game and is second in scoring with nearly 15 points per game.</p>\n<p>As the third youngest team in the nation, the Gauchos have struggled to remain consistent and tough from game to game, an issue they hope to resolve starting against Wyoming.</p>\n<p>“Everybody has watched the success that LSU and Illinois State, and now Boise State, have with just denying us, physically denying us,” Coach Williams said. “I expect them to be very physical with us, try to get into us and cause problems in doing that.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, UCSB allows nearly 70 points per game, a number that drops to under 50 when at home. The Cowboys average 67 points per game, reaching 60 or more points in every contest this year.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to get in there and be more physical, be tougher and change our mindset,” Alan Williams said. “We’re a really good team at home.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for tonight’s game is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 28th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49058\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/gauchos-stay-undefeated-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49058\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/gauchos-stay-undefeated-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/gauchos-stay-undefeated-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/gauchos-stay-undefeated-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/gauchos-stay-undefeated-home/","id":4494,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[4493,4492,4491],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Ends Season Winning Three of Four","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Andrew Checketts finished off his first year as head coach of the UCSB baseball team with a neutral .500 record, but in high fashion with a 3-1 mark during the last weekend series of the season.

The Gauchos hit the ball in to play 11 times on the day, nine more than the Utes, and took the 3-2 win to open the weekend.</p>\n<p>“We got out early and attacked the pitcher,” Vertigan said. “We were able to hit and put up a few runs quick.”</p>\n<p>Later that day UCSB faced CSUB and gave up the most runs it had all season in an 18-8 loss on the Roadrunner’s home field. Also making the record books was Vertigan, who hit his ninth triple of the year and in doing so set the single-season UCSB record.</p>\n<p>Freshman lefthander Andrew Vasquez joined Vertigan in the record books by striking out enough batters in the game to jump past the 100-strikeout mark and was the first freshman to do so since Cy Young award-winner Barry Zito.</p>\n<p>“We couldn’t get out of innings, and we were unable to get people out early,” Vertigan said. “We weren’t able to let our defense work, even though our offense did come to life, but we were too far into the hole to come back and win that game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s third game on Saturday was commanded by senior lefthander Zak Edgington, who threw eight innings and gave up just one earned run in a 6-2 Gaucho win over Utah.</p>\n<p>“[Edgington] works really fast, and he kept them on their heels,” Vertigan said. “He did a great job of throwing strikes and getting people out early.”</p>\n<p>The final game of the weekend allowed Checketts to walk off the field with 28 wins, the most that a first-year head coach has had at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Senior righthander Matt Vedo pitched his third save of the year, striking out four batters in two innings. Vertigan’s three hits added to his total of 90 on the year, which ranks at No. 6 in Gaucho baseball history.</p>\n<p>“It was nice to play some quality baseball and finish off playing like we’ve wanted to play all year,” Checketts said. “Our short game was good, and our guy’s ability to execute and our ability to play team offense and play team offense with runners on third and less than two outs was really good; it was pretty impressive from an efficiency standpoint.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47223\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-29/ucsb-ends-season-winning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47223\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-29/ucsb-ends-season-winning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-29/ucsb-ends-season-winning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-29/ucsb-ends-season-winning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-29/ucsb-ends-season-winning/","id":4491,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4490,4489,4488],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dela Cruz, Soutar Reelected to Chair Positions","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2017-01-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IVRPD-Plastino_By-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IVRPD-Plastino_By-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Recreation & Park District (IVRPD) board of directors voted Thursday during their monthly meeting to reelect Pegeen Soutar as chair of the board and Paola Dela Cruz as vice chair.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_64396\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IVRPD-Plastino_By-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1539383589\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74887\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64396\" data-attachment-id=\"64396\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-30/isla-vistans-write-to-keep-plastino/ivrpd-plastino_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IVRPD-Plastino_By-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1438194078\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVRPD-Plastino_By Lorenzo Basilio-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IVRPD-Plastino_By-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IVRPD-Plastino_By-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64396\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IVRPD-Plastino_By-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Pegeen Soutar (right) at an Isla Vista Recreation and Park District meeting in July 2015.

We will have a pitch limit on our starters just because it is early in the season but they have been able to extend out and get themselves in shape enough to go out there for a hundred pitches or so,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “There will be some mixing and matching and varied lineups just because we are so young and still trying to figure out what exactly we have, but we are going to play to win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is led by second year coach Checketts, who last season recorded the most wins of a first year head coach at UCSB by going 28-28. Looking to build upon last season, Checketts has recruited an impressive class to compliment returning players like junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and senior third baseman Marc Venning. The 2012 recruitment class has been ranked No. 12 in the country by Baseball America and No. 18 in the nation by Perfect Game, both being program highs. Checketts has received much of his own accolades this preseason as he has been named as a “Top 10 College Head Coach under 40” by Baseball America and a “Coach on the Rise” by Perfect Game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Along with managerial duties, Checketts is also the squads pitching coach. Under the guidance of Checkets last season, sophomore pitcher Andrew Vasquez finished the year with a 1.93 ERA and was the first Gaucho freshman to strike out over 100 batters since current San Francisco Giant and former Gaucho Barry Zito. His freshman season earned him second team Big West honors and was named to the Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American team. Vasquez will headline the powerful pitching staff of the Gauchos and start game one of the series against the Bulldogs tonight.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara pitchers will be tested early this season as Fresno’s junior outfielder Aaron Judge is coming off a season in which he earned First Team Honors in the Western Athletic Conference and won the TD Ameritrade College Home Run Derby.</p>\n<p>“[We] have to try to minimize around him. The best thing to do is make sure he is hitting with nobody on base,” Checketts said. “We need to do a good job of getting the guys hitting in front of him in the lineup out. I think if we can do a good job with that I trust our pitching staff against him and that they have good enough stuff to get him out.”</p>\n<p>This weekend’s games begin at 6:35 p.m. both tonight and Saturday. Sunday’s game starts at 1:05 p.m. with Vasquez taking the mound in game one followed by sophomore pitcher Austin Pettibone on Saturday, while the Sunday starter is still to be announced.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 15th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50203\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-begins-season-against-fresno-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50203\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-begins-season-against-fresno-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-begins-season-against-fresno-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-begins-season-against-fresno-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-begins-season-against-fresno-state/","id":4493,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4492,4491,4490],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
