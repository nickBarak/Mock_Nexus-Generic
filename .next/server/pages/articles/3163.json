The cookie program is also the country’s largest financial investment in girls annually.</p>\n<p>The Girl Scouts recently debuted “Caramel Chocolate Chip” for the 2019 season, accompanying the iconic line-up of Thin Mints, Samoas, Trefoils and more.</p>\n<p>This year, Girl Scouts sell cookies across campus in prime locations near the University Center, Pardall Tunnel and Davidson Library.</p>\n<p>Skyler, a local 13-year-old, set her stand in front of the library last Monday night. She said she has been selling cookies on the UCSB campus for the past two years.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of really enthusiastic people and it’s always a treat to be here,” Skyler said.</p>\n<p>Skyler experimented selling cookies at a variety of locations on campus and decided on the location based on where she found the most people.</p>\n<p>“As it gets later and people start to go to bed, I migrate over there,” Skyler said as she pointed toward the freshmen Chi-5 dorms.</p>\n<p>Thin Mints, Caramel Delights and Peanut Butter Patties are especially popular this year, according to Skyler. This year, Skyler’s goal is to sell 3,000 boxes of cookies.</p>\n<p>Lilly Rodriguez, the sister of two local Girl Scouts, posted on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page offering pre-orders for cookies. Within a day, she received over 50 messages.</p>\n<p>“I enjoy helping my sisters out so they can go on trips with their troop. My older sister is planning on going to San Francisco and my little sister will use the money for activities,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>Many Girl Scouts are now accepting payment through Venmo, a mobile payment app, in an effort to increase sales to college students who may not carry cash.</p>\n<p>Sixth grader Olivia F. is excited by the increased profits from the usage of Venmo.</p>\n<p>“We love Venmo. We took over $1,000 on it at our UCSB cookie booth. Not all troops use it but we think it is a must,” Olivia said.</p>\n<p>“[Students] get very excited when they hear us yell ‘We take Venmo.’”</p>\n<p>Olivia is aiming to sell 500 boxes this year, enticed by the pair of narwhal slippers that she would win as a prize. She is optimistic about where the profits from this year’s sales will go.</p>\n<p>“We are using some of the money to go to Kaleidoscope, a large Girl Scout camping trip at Live Oak Campground. We haven’t voted how to spend the rest but last year we did horseback riding,” Farley said.</p>\n<p>UCSB students welcome the Girl Scouts to campus, as they bring back childhood memories and offer delicious cookies.</p>\n<p>“I was a Girl Scout for many years, and it reminds me of my days of selling cookies,” Anika Ahlstro, first-year communication and art history major, said.</p>\n<p>“The cookies bring me happiness whenever I eat them, especially Thin Mints and Tagalongs.”</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Feb. 10, 1:44 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Ashley Rusch and Amira Garewal are staff writers at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Election Committee’s funding for their “Votetopia” campaign to mobilize student participation in the Spring Election during last night’s five-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>The Council allocated additional funding for Votetopia from its Special Projects account to supplement the funding it received after originally requesting $7,543 from Finance Board to rent Corwin Pavilion and provide four times as many T-shirts for the event. The Council approved an allocation of $2,200 to the campaign, including $800 for free T-shirts, $360 for stickers and $200 for the results announcement.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Chair Sunjeet Gill said although over 40 percent of undergraduate students voted in last year’s Spring Election, she hopes the campaign will motivate an even higher turnout.</p>\n<p>“These shirts can be worn year after year and we thought the theme would be fun,” Gill said. “We want more and more of a percentage to get out and vote each year.”</p>\n<p>Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said she thinks it will be difficult to distribute the T-shirts during the association’s four-day campaign.</p>\n<p>“I did a month-long campaign once and even then it was hard to give away T-shirts with heavy publicizing,” Mayorga said. “There are so many T-shirts being given out already that it might be an overload.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Jason Lopez said he feels the Elections Committee has already spent an excessive amount on advertising for Spring Elections.</p>\n<p>“My main issue with this is that they paid almost $10,000 in ads,” Lopez said. “People who read the Nexus generally read it every day and they don’t need to see these ads in issue after issue.”</p>\n<p>Some representatives suggested cost-cutting options such as announcing election results at a smaller venue and using an MP3 player instead of hiring a DJ.</p>\n<p>The Council also passed a Resolution to Support the Execution of the Student-Initiated Democratic Education, a program that would allow undergraduate students to teach pass/no pass seminars.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Council approved a Resolution to Support the Implementation of the A.S. Food Bank. According to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, the food bank will be operational shortly.</p>\n<p>The Council continued discussion about plans for their Isla Vista Annex and A.S. café.

Legislative Council meeting, members approved the Human Rights Board as an A.S. committee by a 20-1 vote. Following Arreola’s decision, the council, which can override a veto by a two-thirds vote, will address the matter at its meeting tonight.</p>\n<p>In his statement, Arreola called into question several of the bill’s elements, noting problems with its financial and organizational plans. The bill states that the new board will have a projected $0 fiscal impact for A.S. The HRB, however, calls for a Treasurer, Event Coordinator, Freshmen First-Year and Outreach Coordinator, as well as two Human Rights weeks per academic year, Arreola noted.</p>\n<p>“I do not see how any of these efforts will be possible without tapping into the Associated Students unallocated dollars,” Arreola wrote.</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President Chris Wendle, Arreola’s veto was a well thought-out decision.</p>\n<p>“I agree with his veto,” Wendle said. “…as the IVP looking at the structure of A.S., in my opinion there is evidence that shows that A.S. is expanding a little too fast… We need to appeal to what we have now; make our student government run a little more efficiently and understand exactly where our money is right now before we spend any more on new A.S. boards.”</p>\n<p>Arreola also listed other reasons for vetoing the HRB, including concerns about the vague nature of the group’s organizational structure, which calls for permanent directors from six non-A.S. groups and two A.S. groups. Another potential problem, Arreola wrote, is the HRB’s mission statement.</p>\n<p>“These set parameters allow for the proposed HRB to take stances on political issues, which we have seen Legislative Council struggle with in the past,” Arreola said. “By approving this bill, Legislative Council will be legitimizing a board that can potentially take a stance on political issues. This can potentially place the Associated Students in a compromising position by marginalizing the student body.”</p>\n<p>Nicolas Pascal, director of the UCSB Human Rights Council, said he was disappointed that Arreola did not share his concerns earlier.</p>\n<p>“I would have preferred that he would have worked with the Leg Council members who were working very seriously in the drafting of this bill,” Pascal said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-28/president-blocks-approval-board/","id":3161,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[3160,3159,3158],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Leg.

Despite having allotted Transportation &amp; Parking Services a $3.33 lock-in fee at the end of last year, the department has recently increased the price of permits.</p>\n<p>In addition to the paying the quarterly lock-in, A.S. Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said students are now expected to contribute an additional $17.50 per quarter to guarantee free night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>“We have to decide where we want to move forward with it,” Elwood said.</p>\n<p>Following a drawn-out discussion, the board decided to form an ad hoc committee to further investigate the matter.</p>\n<p>“What kind of message does this send to parking services if we give in to their demands?” Representative-at-Large Danielle Mayorga said. “Certain questions need to be answered by PTS before we move forward with this discussion.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the board passed a resolution supporting the federal Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, which seeks to provide immigrants greater access to higher education.</p>\n<p>Alfredo del Cid, university owned off-campus housing representative, said it was A.S.’s duty to speak on behalf of those students who pay student fees, but are denied access to financial aid and other services — a problem which the federal bill will address.</p>\n<p>“These undocumented students are part of our university and the people we represent,” del Cid said. “We’re losing them every day because they just can’t afford to keep paying into the system.”</p>\n<p>Board members were unsure about how their resolution would support the legislation, but the council eventually approved the action.</p>\n<p>Nayra Pacheco, a third-year environmental studies and history of public policy major, said the bill’s main purpose is to establish solidarity between students of all backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“Basically, it allows us to say our student government is behind us and supports the D.R.E.A.M. Act,” Pacheco said. “It helps a lot to have your backing, especially if we need posters or other campaign materials. It’s good to have that backing when we go to Finance Board.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/leg-council-debates-parking-permit-hike/","id":3162,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3161,3160,3159],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
