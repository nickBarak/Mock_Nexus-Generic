The more research I put in, the more excited I get. There are so many options that it’s almost overwhelming; with over 40 countries and 171 different programs to choose from, it feels as though the world is at my fingertips. What a privilege it is to go to a university like this where we have the opportunity to travel the world — and further our education while we’re at it. Then I found the tear in this perfect canvas of options: It might not be safe for me to go abroad. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92135\" style=\"width: 318px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92135\" data-attachment-id=\"92135\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-25/is-studying-abroad-safe-for-queer-students/lgbt-oped/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LGBT-oped-e1579757418953.png?fit=450%2C637&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"450,637\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LGBT oped\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LGBT-oped-e1579757418953.png?fit=177%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LGBT-oped-e1579757418953.png?fit=724%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-92135\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LGBT-oped-e1579757418953.png?resize=308%2C436\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"436\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92135\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brea Spenser / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was surfing the UCSB Education Abroad Program (EAP) page for about the 100th time, I noticed a link titled “LGBTQ Students.” “Hey that’s me!” I thought happily, and clicked on it. The first paragraph on the page explains that with exposure to different cultures all around the world comes different views on gender and sexuality — views that might radically diverge from our own. There is a </span><a href=\"https://eap.ucsb.edu/getting-started/lgbtq-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in this paragraph that I especially like, and I commend whoever wrote it. It says, “When you venture out in the world, you carry your identity with you even if it is not readily apparent to those around you. Going abroad can therefore represent a second ‘coming out’, and you will need to make decisions about how and when to express your LGBTQ identity.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a very thoughtful way to say, “as a queer person, not all countries are safe for you.” </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scroll a little further and you’ll find “</span><a href=\"https://eap.ucsb.edu/getting-started/lgbtq-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk Levels and Risk Mitigation Strategies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” This is the first thing that any queer person considering going abroad should look at. Included is a link to a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18uJKCx7Zn_HGF4QNjW4FzAUEmkYHlzXyOCdu1Zp5kGY/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Doc</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a country by country breakdown. In this breakdown each country is labeled either “very safe,” “mostly safe,” “unsafe” and “very unsafe,” with some being “neither particularly unsafe or particularly safe.” They also go on to define qualities that make “extreme risk,” “high risk” or “moderate risk” countries. Quick spoiler alert: Of the 39 countries listed, only two get the coveted title of “very safe” (Canada and Argentina).   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before coming across this very valuable document, I had spoken to a UCEAP peer advisor. I told her that I was interested in maybe going to a country in Africa. She was very kind and helpful and informed me that there are more scholarship opportunities for certain countries because they tend to have fewer applicants. She suggested Ghana, since she had studied there herself and loved it. After discovering the country-by-country risk breakdown, I looked up Ghana and found out it is considered “unsafe” for LGBTQ folks, as there are “explicit restrictions on LGBTIA+ expression &amp; rights,” and “governmental &amp; societal treatment is poor.” Okay, so maybe not Ghana. But this must be an exception, right? Surely there can’t be many study abroad options that are unsafe for so many students at this school?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The color and beauty and love and strength that I feel walking around at a Pride parade could result in me getting attacked, jailed or killed in some parts of the world.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After nixing Ghana, I did a bit more research and found a summer internship abroad opportunity in South Africa. It sounded interesting and relevant to my future, so I decided to check out its risk level:  “neither particularly unsafe or particularly safe.” Yes! This was a win. South Africa it is. After all, it says queer PDA </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lead to violence and tension, as opposed to Russia where it says queer PDA is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">likely </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to cause violence and tension, or in Ghana where male-male relationships could lead to imprisonment for 10 or more years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But why am I so excited about what feels like less than the bare minimum? I’d much prefer a place that’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">particularly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> safe. Not neutral. While it’s a better option than Russia, Barbados, Tanzania, Jordan, Senegal or Indonesia — all of which are considered high-risk countries — I’d still prefer to study in a place where I can be sure my identity won’t endanger me if it comes up in conversation. So can I go to South Africa? The answer is yes, but I’m still scared. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m grateful to have this list, because I’m sure there was a time when it didn’t exist at all. I’m grateful that I have the information I need to keep myself safe, but there is still something so scary about it. This list is a reminder to me that so much of the world still doesn’t accept this community. The color and beauty and love and strength that I feel walking around at a Pride parade could result in me getting attacked, jailed or killed in some parts of the world. When I sing along in the shower to Hayley Kiyoko, Troye Sivan or Frank Ocean, I feel seen and heard, but there are so many people who cannot feel seen or heard because they are afraid for their lives. I can proudly go see Trixie Mattel at a school-sponsored event and know that I am surrounded by literally hundreds of other students who couldn’t care less whether or not I like girls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then, other times, I’m afraid too. Sometimes I get nervous holding my girlfriend’s hand when I find myself travelling outside of my bubble. I wonder what the risk level is for the United States — depending on where you are, the answer may change. Even California, a place that most would consider pretty safe for minorities, has 83 hate groups as of 2018 — </span><a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map/by-state\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than any other U.S. state. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice to other LGBTQ students out there considering studying abroad: Do your research and utilize the resources available to us. I long for the day when we don’t have to worry about our physical safety when making decisions like this and when I can browse naively, as I did when the world was my oyster. I know that I don’t “look” queer, and many foreign laws around homosexuality are targeted at men so, in theory, I could still go to Ghana or Russia and probably be fine. But the fact remains that the world is not my oyster, because no class credit is worth going back in the closet. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wishes safe travels to all the global Gauchos out there.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

My dorm room looked out onto the lagoon and I was just a five-minute walk away from the ocean. It was so beautiful that I felt unnerved and alone. It was so white that I thought of campus as being the Wonderbread World.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came from the Jefferson Park/Crenshaw area of Los Angeles that at the time was still largely a community of African Americans who, like me, originated from Texas or New Orleans. It was a vibrant place to grow up. There were many skilled craftsmen in the neighborhood; my neighbor Charles owned a Jaguar repair shop and did very well with his business. My dad was the neighborhood mechanic and worked nights at the post office, so he was around in the daytime to take me and my neighborhood friends to the beach or Griffith Park.

Lovecraft back in 1973. It was a rich and complicated black world where I developed confidence in my intelligence and talent.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, I needed all that confidence because UCSB was an overwhelming transition. In my neighborhood I knew no white people outside of my teachers, and most of them were white.  I lucked out with Mr. Martin, my African American second grade teacher who realized I wasn’t “retarded” like that nun at Holy Name of Jesus Christ, I Wept said to my mother. He expected the best out of his classroom of difficult black kids, and, later in high school, Mr. Klewitz (a former Marine) taught us photography. Then there was Mr. De Louise who taught the first creative writing course I took. And Mr. Feldman, who started an aviation club at my high school and took black and Asian kids flying in small planes with flying buddies. There was Mr. Soloff, who took us to Cal State LA to see his chemical experiments as he pursued his master’s degree in chemistry. The commonality between all these teachers is that they treated us like they gave a damn and included us in their lives. They weren’t indifferent to who we were </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they seemed to actually care about us.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and all the UCs need to lead the way on creating solutions to help schools in economically challenged communities like USC has done. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, in my first chemistry lecture class, the professor said: “Look to your left and look to your right. By the end of the course both of those chairs will be empty.” I assumed he was talking to me, so I never went back to class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like I was living in foreign country and I didn’t know if I wanted to stay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t acculturating because I lived close enough to Los Angeles that I went home often </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so often that I won the ironic award for being the most social guy on our dorm floor by being the least present.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then I stopped going to LA.  My high school girlfriend had been admitted to UCSB, and I discovered that she was now very popular. She was skinny and tall and, though that wasn’t desirable where I grew up, at UCSB she was popular.  She kicked me to the curb, and I was lost for a bit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lonely was bad enough, but then I failed a course for plagiarism — I copied copiously from the Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I hadn’t taken notes in my philosophy course because I was too busy listening to what the professor was saying in the lectures. I had to drop chemistry, and suddenly I was on academic probation. I saw myself being tossed out on my ass and losing my financial aid and everything I had worked on. I feared leaving UCSB and breaking my parents’ hearts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started pulling it together and looked for classes to help me maintain a full load, and I found a poetry workshop with Robin Bell at the College of Creative Studies (CCS). It was fun and exhilarating and, because CCS didn’t give letter grades, I could catch my breath about my biology major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I decided to ask Martha, a Latina I met in our composition course, out for coffee. Martha danced in the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ballet folklórico</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on campus, and she’d invite me to the practices. Among her friends, it didn’t seem to matter that I thought of myself as a black guy. I was a Mexican to them, though I didn’t speak Spanish and neither did Martha. I liked hanging out with her friends.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                            </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martha left UCSB.  She felt it wasn’t a good fit for her, like many of the students of color I had become friends with. UCSB became even more devoid of color as I recovered from a broken heart. Luckily, I had made friends with some of the guys on my dorm floor and soon I was living on Del Playa with Pat, a cowboy hippie, and some other guys. No one had explained to me that there was a yearly I.V. riot. I shot photos for the Daily Nexus of guys in swimming trunks and women in bikinis tossing bottles at the police from the relative safety of my fenced-in yard. No way was I going to wander I.V. and be arrested for being the black dude with a stolen camera.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to learn the ropes at the CCS. I took a narrative prose course from Marvin Mudrick, who had a great sense of humor and would occasionally rip folks apart in his class. He said my science fiction story, which I had published and won money for, made him want to throw up. I turned to writing about my black neighborhood in LA and he liked it, though he didn’t know I had written it: Mudrick taught his writing workshops by having writers toss their work on the table in front of him and he’d read the stories cold, out loud. It was a revelation. I wasn’t being judged </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the story was being judged. I felt free to write about my life because I was anonymous. After 40 years of teaching workshops, I still believe his method of running a workshop is the best.  Also, Provost Mudrick valued diversity, and CCS was diverse. My friends and fellow students at CCS were black, brown, white and Asian. I never felt excluded. I felt supported as a student of literature and as a writer. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt like I was living in foreign country and I didn’t know if I wanted to stay.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I won awards for my writing as an undergraduate and after receiving my master of fine arts in literature at UC Irvine. I sold my first novel, “Understand This,” to William Morrow, went on to publish six novels and some spent time on the LA Times bestsellers list.  One of the novels takes place at UCSB and is about life on campus and in Santa Barbara for African and Latino students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I owe a lot of my success as a writer to CCS and UCSB. From being a Disney screenwriting fellow to a Shanghai writers fellow, from starting LitFest Pasadena (the second-largest literary festival in California and the most diverse) to watching my daughter Giselle graduate from UCSB four years ago, just like her mother did, and then receiving a White House internship and internships with Senator Diane Feinstein and Congresswoman Judy Chu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve taught at USC, UCLA, LMU and UCI, but I think of UCSB as home. My observation and suggestion for UCSB is to embrace diversity by doing what USC has done with their highly lauded and internationally known Neighborhood Academic Initiative (NAI). The program fosters diversity by supporting public schools in the most economically challenged communities, particularly for incarcerated youth. CCS has hosted NAI students at UCSB a number of times. As a former high school teacher who taught in inner-city schools and wrote about them, I know that aligning with a major academic institution with resources can bring tremendous positive change, but the commitment has to be long term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USC’s NAI program has been going on for 29 years, and Foshay, a NAI school, is now the number-one feeder high school for USC in the country. NAI students have a higher graduation rate than the general student body at USC. When I was a kid, I attended Foshay Junior High, and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. I constantly worried about my personal safety. Now, it’s famous for creating the kinds of students who flourish at the university level. UCSB and all the UCs need to lead the way on creating solutions to help schools in economically challenged communities like USC has done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the hiring process at the UCs needs to address the dearth of professors of color. It doesn’t take rocket science to create a pool of qualified applicants and then use random selection to escape the inherent racism of basing some portion of hiring on congeniality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, I owe my career, my happiness and my literary achievement to the CCS and UCSB, but I hope to see UCSB and all the UCs become a more vital force for cultural and economic inclusion. It can and should be done. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jervey Tervalon is an author and professor of writing &amp; literature in the College of Creative Studies.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93086\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsb-from-wonderbread-world-to-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93086\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsb-from-wonderbread-world-to-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsb-from-wonderbread-world-to-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsb-from-wonderbread-world-to-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsb-from-wonderbread-world-to-home/","id":5657,"author":{"id":822,"name":"Jervey Tervalon"},"related":[5656,5655,5654],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Living in Ambiguity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Hyphenated American","publish_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/multiracial1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/multiracial1.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sophia Lovell explores the difficulties of defining your cultural identity when you come from a mixed race background.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I guess I just assumed that you were Mexican,” is a line that I have heard far too many times.

Society has taught us to break physical features up into racial categories, to see certain eye shapes as “Asian” or hair textures as “Black.” Relying on stereotypes can make it difficult to see beyond black and white views of race — no pun intended. However, this can be detrimental to mixed-race individuals’ journeys to healthy self-identification. Society teaches us to rely on the validation of others, which is difficult for multiracial children when no one is able to affirm your race.  </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These standards warp a person’s sense of self. As a little kid, I would always raise my hand when taking a test that began with a survey asking for your race. “What should I put? It says choose one but I’m half-and-half.” I used to switch off between Caucasian (white, European, or Middle Eastern) and Asian/Pacific Islander. It felt like choosing between parents. At such an impressionable young age, I couldn’t even understand my racial identity and yet I was expected to be able to define myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, these questionnaires have added either the “Two or more races” category, or simply, “Other,” allowing for greater inclusion of interracial people. Except it is degrading to simply be marked as “Other,” as if to remind us that we don’t belong. Furthermore, this “otherhood” lumps  all multiracial people into one category. Multiracial people are often grouped together as one despite the word’s diverse connotations.  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What should I put? It says choose one but I’m half-and-half.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be hard to find affirmation within the very cultures that we belong to. I find myself jealous of my monoracial peers who are able to easily experience their rich cultural identities. I am constantly the whitest Asian person, or the most Asian white person in the room. I feel little association with either grouping, and therefore it sometimes feels as if not being “racially pure” removes what little association I do have. I remember being dressed in a kimono for the first time in a small store in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. My sister and I were treated like tourists until my mom appeared, confirming our identities as Japanese children. Instantly we were given greater kimono options and guidance on what obis to pair with them. People in my life constantly remind me that I am not fully white, though they do so with the intention of being complimentary. My generation often associates white people with negative connotations. Whenever someone deems the entire white community as racist, ignorant or otherwise dishonorable, I am always assured by my peers that this does not include me due to my Japanese culture. Even though they say this with good intentions, it feels strange to me, as if I should be embarrassed to be white, as though I was given a choice in the matter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there are beautiful things that come with being multiracial. Growing up this way makes you more adaptable to the surrounding world. Mutliracial people are able to use the racism they have endured themselves to understand and advocate for others. Being both white and Japanese gives me a distinctive outlook on the world. I think that even the fact that my parents made the rebellious choice to marry outside their respective races and have children gives me an interesting history. My ancestors came from opposite sides of the world; my existence is proof of how connected we as humans can truly be. If each of my parents could accept an individual from an entirely different background, why can’t the rest of us? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has taken me a long time to feel comfortable and happy with both sides of my cultural identity: to claim both the stories of my maternal grandfather’s internment at the age of 12, and also the stories of my great-great-grandfather driving his family across the country after the Dust Bowl at the age of 12. Although I have always been aware that I am not defined solely by my race, we live in a society where race is simply unforgettable. When we, as mixed individuals, claim our racial backgrounds, we can show the rest of the world who buys into stereotypes that there is more to a person than what meets the eye.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Lovell challenges you to embrace your culture while daring to defy racial stereotypes. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

He sounds so American.” That would be because he was born in Minnesota and grew up in California, speaking English as his first — and only — language. Did I mention he’s also American? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never realized your mom has such a heavy Asian accent,” the grown man said. He then proceeded to provide his best imitation of a stereotypical Asian accent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an immigrant who moved to America when she was 12 years old, my mother was experiencing the cultural shock of being in a new country and learning English as a second language. At this point in her life, her father had already passed away and her mother would pass away months after they moved to the United States. I was — and still am — incredibly proud of my mother for the trials she has overcome, a language barrier being one of them. Even before I fully understood what racism meant, I was still astonished, and inwardly cringing, that someone would make such an ignorant joke at the expense of my mom’s “heavy accent.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many Asian Americans are experiencing another threat on top of the fear of contracting the coronavirus — the fear of verbal and physical assault.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only after recently listening to Jiayang Fan, a staff writer at The New Yorker, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/podcasts/the-daily/racism-chinese-coronavirus-asian-americans.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak about her own story</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an episode of “The Daily” podcast, did I recognize the “probational” nature of being Asian American. Would my experience be different if I was an immigrant? If my first language was Chinese or Vietnamese? If I didn’t have an American accent? If I didn’t understand English grammar and slang? Oh, absolutely. Even having a name like Calista, which originates from Greek, rather than a traditional Chinese or Vietnamese name, has factored into my experience as an Asian American.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in such uncertain times. The anxiety, loneliness and fear many Americans are feeling is completely valid. Like many others, I fear contracting the virus and the ramifications this would have for the family members I am sheltered with right now. And yet, many Asian Americans are experiencing another threat on top of the fear of contracting the coronavirus — the fear of verbal and physical assault. Although I have not been a </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">target of racial slurs or hate crimes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during the pandemic, I know the same cannot be said for others who look like me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Words have power. Whether it’s a racial slur yelled by a bigot or an ignorant joke made at the expense of a minority group, these words leave a lasting impression. The language President Donald Trump uses in regard to COVID-19 disregards the </span><a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2015/naming-new-diseases/en/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Health Organization’s practices</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of refraining from using geographic locations to name new infectious diseases in order “to minimize unnecessary negative effects on nations, economies and people.” Such language, spoken by the president no less, allows for the continuation of racism and xenophobia in our country. The virus is not an excuse for racism. Fear itself is not an excuse. Ignorance is not an excuse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no excuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although racism is a deep-rooted problem that the U.S. has carried throughout its history, there are still ways we can mitigate the pain and suffering it inflicts in our daily lives. Being conscious of the language we use and holding others accountable to do the same is a start. If you are in a position of privilege, then use that power to defend someone who is being targeted and be an advocate for the disenfranchised. At the very least, how about, just don’t be a racist? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am grateful for the opportunities I have had growing up as an American. I am proud to be half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. I hope to one day be proud of my country too.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calista Liu would like people to just stop being racist.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D44A3CB0-5277-4902-B400-DFEEFA079B68.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calistaliu/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Calista Liu</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Calista Liu currently serves as Social Media Manager.
