CSUB hosts the visiting Gauchos with an identical 1-2 record after losing two of three to Utah at home.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

However, the rest of the weekend was a bit of a struggle for the shortstop, as he only went 2-7 in the final two games. He currently still leads the team in batting average (.364), RBI (3), on-base percentage (.462) and slugging percentage (.727).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will also need better outings from veterans J.J. Muno and Austin Bush. Muno, a redshirt junior, went 0-10 on the weekend but did manage two RBIs. Bush, a junior, only mustered one hit in his 11 at-bats and drove in a run, but he struck out five times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Colton Burns was a pleasant surprise on the weekend, and hopefully, he can sustain his confident play. The utility player homered in the opening game against LMU and batted a solid .273 over the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most likely starting today for the Gauchos on the mound will be junior Chris Clements. If he plays, it would be the right-hander’s first action of the season. As a sophomore, he made seven appearances and two starts only mustering a 10.13 ERA over 13.1 innings pitched with 13 strikeouts and eight walks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The junior will need to be on his A-game today as there are some solid hitters in the Bakersfield lineup. Senior Ryan Grotjohn batted .636 over the weekend after going 7-11 against Utah and also drove in one run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow senior Max Carter and junior Andrew Penner also had a solid opening weekend series as both earned five hits a piece and batted .455 and .417, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite not having named a starter, CSUB will be a tough outing for the Gauchos as they have solid arms in the pen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season, the two teams split their two-game series with the road team being the victor in each outing. The Gauchos scored 10 runs in a win but only four runs in the loss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is only one game, this game certainly feels like a must-win for this Gaucho team. It is not a make or break moment, but it would be great to see this team overcome some early season adversity after the high expectations placed on them this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB faces off against CSUB at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 21, at Hardt Field.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Helping the Head Coach in recruiting affairs are assistant coach/recruiting coordinator Eddie Cornejo and assistant coach Neil Walton.</p>\n<p>This No. 9 class includes 16 new faces and five pitchers, something the Gauchos definitely need to recuperate in after losing four this offseason.</p>\n<p>The most promising of the newcomers is quite possibly Chris Lincoln, a 6’4 right-handed pitcher from Rancho Verde High School in Moreno, Calif. who turned down a contract from the Toronto Blue Jays despite being selected in the 13th round.</p>\n<p>“It was tough [deciding between MLB or UCSB], there were a lot of factors that went into it,” Lincoln said. “Ultimately, one of the things that persuaded me was the coaching staff and great head coach. I knew I was coming to a winning team that would help me grow as a player.”</p>\n<p>Lincoln was a tremendous high school pitcher as he had a 2.23 season ERA along with 66 strikeouts in only 59 innings pitched. During his three years on his varsity baseball team, Chris accumulated a 2.92 ERA and 181 Ks in 40 appearances in which 27 of those were starts. But even before his excellent senior campaign, Lincoln signed with UCSB during his junior year on Nov. 13 of 2015.</p>\n<p>“The fact that I knew where I was going put a lot of pressure off of me and I was glad I knew where I wanted to go after high school,” Lincoln said. “This is a wonderful, top notch school and a great environment to play.”</p>\n<p>Of course, Lincoln is not the only incoming Gaucho who had an amazing stat line. Left-hander Ben Brecht was also an amazing pitcher in high school especially during his senior year when he went 8-0 with a 0.31 ERA in 44 innings pitched and 74 strikeouts. The Chicago native was First Team All-State and was selected in the 36th round by the Baltimore Orioles.</p>\n<p>Both these players will be mentored by some of the best collegiate baseball players in the country including guys like junior J.J. Muno who was a sparkplug for UCSB, and junior power hitter Austin Bush.</p>\n<p>“Everyone on the team has been great. All the upperclassmen help us really well and make sure we become great, I love it.” Lincoln said.</p>\n<p>The final thing the Gauchos did this offseason to solidify the success this team will have in the future is the extension given to Checketts which now puts him through 2022.</p>\n<p>With fresh talent set to come in, great athletes still left on the roster from last years’ College World Series run and a well put together coaching staff kept in place, the 2016-17 UCSB baseball team will definitely be a team to watch.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

focused on making Greek life more sustainable – was founded less than a year ago, according Kappa Alpha Theta member Miranda de Moraes, a third-year sociology and philosophy major.</p>\n<p>The organization is currently operated by two co-presidents: de Moraes and Dean Narlock, a third-year computer science major and Sigma Pi member.</p>\n<p>The farmer’s market, held between 12 p.m. and 3 p.m., featured a handful of campus organizations and local businesses from the greater Santa Barbara area: Blue Ridge Honey, I.V. Food Co-op, I.V. Trading Post, the Climate Reality Project, I.V. Surfrider and the Program for Assessment and Certification for the Environment and Sustainability (P.A.C.E.S).</p>\n<p>Some served various types of food, while others showed off art pieces and live music; all promoted “eating environmentally” and environmentally conscious attitudes.</p>\n<p>“We’re really hoping to educate anyone [who came to our] event on how to choose your foods, whether you’re at the grocery store or a farmer’s market, and know the story behind everything you buy,” Narlock said.</p>\n<p>De Moraes said the organization was first created to address the lack of sustainable practices in Greek life at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Greek life is a massive organization of people, and unless environmentalism is a top priority, it will inevitably generate a lot of waste due to the number of people involved,” she said.</p>\n<p>Greeks Go Green is officially recognized by UCSB due to its sponsorship by the Inter-Greek Council, allowing it to have its own budget, according to de Moraes.</p>\n<p>It is also entirely supported through donations and fundraisers, she said.</p>\n<p>“We did a restoration project with [the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration] and were able to raise $200 dollars from that by planting native plants and eradicating invasive ones,” de Moraes said.</p>\n<p>Projects generally take place within Greek life houses, focusing on sustainable practices such as “getting compost and recycling bins in the houses or reducing the use of styrofoam in the kitchens,” Narlock said.</p>\n<p>According to Narlock, Greeks Go Green is divided into two subcommittees – projects and events – that plan accordingly in respect to the organization’s quarterly theme. This quarter’s theme was sustainable food consumption, promoted through Sunday’s event.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85279\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85279\" data-attachment-id=\"85279\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/greeks-go-green-hosts-farmers-market-promotes-environmentally-sustainable-practices/img_1990/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?fit=1280%2C853&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,853\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_1990\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85279\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1990.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85279\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The event also featured live music. Courtesy<em> of Nolan Fuss</em></p></div>\n<p>Narlock added that Sunday’s event was planned by the core executive council as well as the events committee.</p>\n<p>Last quarter, the organization’s focus was “on sustainable fashion,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We partnered with I.V. Trading Post to hold an inter-Greek clothing swap that was open to the community,” he said.</p>\n<p>De Mores noted that between 400 and 600 pieces of clothing were diverted from landfills simply through small donations during the event.</p>\n<p>Although relatively new, Greeks Go Green has made significant progress in making Greek life and Greek housing more sustainable with their composting project, de Mores said.</p>\n<p>For example, Greeks Go Green collaborated with Marborg Industries to create a food scrap collection program. She added that the goal of the program is to divert scraps and waste from participating chapter kitchens and turn it into mulch rather than trash.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to implement a food scrap collection program in several chapter kitchens, which is a big deal because around 40 people live in each chapter house. In most of them, there is a chef or kitchen staff of some sort that’s preparing the food for everyone in the house,” she said.</p>\n<p>“That staff is now diverting those pre-consumer food scraps from landfills by using this food scrap collection program we’ve implemented with Marborg, which is the county’s trash collection service. That compost is going to local orchards and farms in the area in the form of mulch.”</p>\n<p>The addition of a sustainability chair in all Greek houses, another key success to Greeks Go Green, provides each chapter with the opportunity and power to make changes regarding its environmental impact, Narlock said.</p>\n<p>In the future, he hopes to see a growth in support of Greeks Go Green with the addition of younger members to continue to promote environmental awareness after he and de Mores graduate.</p>\n<p>“Our big push through this year is getting some young energy involved in our group. Miranda and I are both juniors, so getting freshman and sophomores involved once we graduate is going to be a key focus for us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The delay in the start of her term would have meant that Jordan would serve for longer than the two-year term, according to Jordan.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was time for someone else to step into that position as I’m finishing up grad school in the next couple months and most likely will be taking career opportunities in a different location,” Jordan said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70006\" style=\"width: 812px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"729574540\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85529\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70006\" data-attachment-id=\"70006\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/as-candidate-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?fit=3399%2C4339&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3399,4339\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Natalie Jordan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?fit=196%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?fit=802%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-70006\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5-802x1024.jpg?resize=802%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"802\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?resize=802%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 802w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?resize=196%2C250&amp;ssl=1 196w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?resize=768%2C980&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AS-Candidate-5.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70006\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jordan left her job late last year. <em>Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p>Jordan, who is set to obtain her masters in technology management from UC Santa Barbara this spring, looks back on the past two years in her position and the challenges, accomplishments and change she has seen along the way.</p>\n<p>“Walking into it, I didn’t really know what it was going to be because we were shaping it,” Jordan said. “I think that it was just more than I could have ever thought or expected to have. It’s a truly amazing experience and I’m blessed to have had it.”</p>\n<p>Jordan’s campaign in 2016 for a position on the Board focused on increasing safety in Isla Vista through securing more street lighting and parking for residents. Now, she says the past two years in her role were more about working with other board members to create the foundation of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and define its role for the public.</p>\n<p>“That was a big part of it for me, was making sure that we were able to kind of set a precedent of what it meant to be on the Isla Vista Community Services District and setting a tone for the community as a resource.”</p>\n<p>Jordan participated in the CSD’s policy committee, which created governing documents for the functioning and mechanics of the Board as well as its interactions with the public and media.</p>\n<p>These policies helped to build the “baseline” for CSD’s growth and efficiency in the future, according to Jordan.</p>\n<p>While Jordan says the CSD has made progress toward increasing safety in Isla Vista, lighting and parking projects never came into full fruition during her term.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD organized lighting walks and began discussion on lighting in I.V., but there is still work to be done before the community will enjoy additional lighting in the area, according to Jordan.</p>\n<p>Increasing parking in I.V. also required a more lengthy and tedious process than anticipated, but as with lighting, Jordan hopes it will continue to be a priority for the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>“It’s still a pressing need for our community but should be set as a long term goal,” Jordan said. “I think there are a lot of solutions to kind of take that on.”</p>\n<p>Among the accomplishments made toward increasing safety in the community, Jordan cited the collaboration made with UC Police Department for safety stations in I.V. and the implementation of an interpersonal violence investigator as steps toward her overall term goals.</p>\n<p>Being the only woman on the board, Jordan said her perspective helped to shed light on safety concerns and issues faced by women in Isla Vista including sexual assault, catcalling and interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>“Of course I can’t speak for all women in any circumstance but I think the perspective I have as a woman in Isla Vista is really imperative… and being able to address those [concerns] from my perspective I think was really important and important for the board and our community to hear and understand,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Now that the board is without a female member, Jordan hopes that women in the community will pursue the opportunity to get involved with the board.</p>\n<p>“I do hope going forward that women in our community are inspired and empowered to come forward to take on these leadership positions.”</p>\n<p>Jordan also noted that her “frankness and honesty” during board meetings allowed her to contribute unique perspectives to discussions.</p>\n<p>“I’m never afraid to really speak my mind. I think that that’s a big part of what I brought to the board… a perspective that I had as a student, as a first-generation college student and a resident of Isla Vista,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Throughout her term, Jordan at times struggled to effectively divide roles and responsibilities among board directors, a challenge which she attributes to the initiative demonstrated by board directors.</p>\n<p>“I think all of us on the board are natural leaders and… everyone wants to take on as much as they can but I think being able to have us all kind of share in that responsibility is a really big part of it.”</p>\n<p>However, Jordan at times arrived late and left I.V. CSD Board meetings early or failed to show up at all, according to <i>Nexus </i>reporters who regularly attend the I.V. CSD meetings.</p>\n<p>Jordan said her absences were due to conflicts with her job as an event coordinator. When her work conflicted with I.V. CSD meetings, Jordan was obligated to attend her paying job over the meetings, which Board directors only began getting paid for last November.</p>\n<p>“I was responsible for paying for my own tuition, which is a big issue so as a full-time student I was also working around 55 hours a week,” Jordan said. “At the end of the day, I needed to make sure that I could pay for my school, which is the reason that I was here in Isla Vista in the first place.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I do hope going forward that women in our community are inspired and empowered to come forward to take on these leadership positions.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>During her term, Jordan oriented herself more toward university players and issues, but said that I.V. CSD could have benefitted from her developing more relationships with stakeholders in I.V. as well.</p>\n<p>“I was much more involved with university politics than I was more local and state, so I think that learning more about those key players and how I could’ve contributed to those conversations would have been meaningful to the board,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Jordan said she fulfilled her role on the board to the best of her ability despite these difficulties. Overall, she said she is proud of the work she did while serving on the Board.</p>\n<p>Going forward, Jordan advises that the I.V. CSD maintains their obligation to the community as their top priority.</p>\n<p>“I think the only thing that we should be concerned about is continuing to serve the community and just always keeping that as our guiding force,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jordan believes the past two years have set up the board for success in the future.</p>\n<p>“I have very high hopes that this inaugural board was precedent setting for expectations for board members for years to come and also in creating relationships with community members and truly being a representative government.”</p>\n<p>For the next I.V. CSD Vice President, Jordan said that being open to the opinions and suggestions of others is vital to the position.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is coming into it with their own unique perspectives and everyone is coming into it with what they feel is the right thing to do,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Hearing people out is the most important thing you can do [when] trying to make an educated decision.”</p>\n<p>Jordan also said that I.V. CSD needs a vice president with a strong resolve and commitment to the community.</p>\n<p>“Somebody who [has] got a can-do attitude and has a little bit of grit. That’s what we need in Isla Vista. Somebody with grit and a willingness to get it done at all costs,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>After completing her master’s degree this June, Jordan hopes to obtain a job that provides her with the same motivation she found while serving on the I.V. CSD Board.</p>\n<p>“Being able to find a career that still gives me that meaning and driving force and willingness to go to work everyday is really important,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>“I hope that eventually I’m able to come back to something like a local elected position because I really found a lot of purpose and meaning in that job as well.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction [1:07 p.m.]: An earlier version of this article said there were three empty seats on the board.
