Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Following its loss to No. 8 Hawaii in the final game of the regular season, the UCSB women’s basketball team will travel to Fullerton, Calif., where they’ll be awaiting their second-round matchup. The Gauchos finished fourth in the Big West at 9-7 and closed out the season 12-16 overall. Considering that this team preparing for a playoff run lost nine games in a row earlier this season is remarkable and demonstrates Santa Barbara’s ability to adapt as well as the coaching staff’s ability to get the best out of players over the course of a season.</p>\n<p>“This time of year you have to be familiar and dust off the cobwebs,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Knowing personnel sets what we need to do. It’s more about your effort, your activity level, your energy and your toughness at this point. We’ve got to manufacture some offense from the free-throw line and in transition.”</p>\n<p>Due to the interesting playoff format of the Big West, UCSB doesn’t actually have a set opponent yet. The Gauchos have a bye for round one, in which teams seeded 5-8 will compete. Out of those four teams (No. 5 CSUN versus No. 8 Hawaii, No. 6 UC Riverside versus No. 7 LBSU), the two winners will advance to play either UCSB or No. 3 UC Irvine. Santa Barbara will take on the highest seed to advance while Irvine will take on the lowest. First place UC Davis as well as second place Cal Poly each receive a double-bye and will await the winners of the UCSB and Irvine games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“[The season] really has played itself out to be an exciting week in tournament play because of so many single-digit games. Everybody’s got to show up and produce and bring what they can bring, and that gives you a chance” said Henrickson.</p>\n<p>Because UCSB is forced to play the highest-seeded team to advance, the Gauchos are able to rule out No. 8 Hawaii from the equation. This means that following Tuesday night’s games, the Gauchos will be met by either CSU Northridge, Riverside or Long Beach in Wednesday night’s matchup. During the conference season, the Gauchos split the series 1-1 with both Northridge and Riverside while defeating Long Beach in both meetings.</p>\n<p>Despite losing both regular-season games to the Gauchos, Long Beach (6-10, 8-22 overall) is on a five-game winning streak that saw the 49ers take down their scheduled opponent for Tuesday night, UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders (6-10, 9-21 overall), in spite of falling to Long Beach in the two teams’ most recent meeting, closed out their regular season with a 76-62 win over top-seeded UC Davis, the Aggies’ second loss in conference play.</p>\n<p>For Riverside, the timely win broke its three-game losing streak and saw the Highlanders’ two leading scorers, senior guard Michelle Curry and redshirt senior guard Lauren Holt, combine for 43 points.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos can rule out facing Hawaii in the second round, they know they’ll play Northridge (8-8, 15-15 overall) given that the Matadors win against the Rainbow Wahine. Northridge’s Channon Fluker, a junior center and the Big West Player of the Year for the second consecutive season, leads the Big West in rebounds, double-doubles, blocked shots and free throws made.</p>\n<p>The Matadors obviously rely on Fluker on both ends of the floor, as she’s also averaged 18.9 points per game. On Jan. 31, Northridge defeated UCSB in the Thunderdome 48-30, a game in which Fluker had 15 points, 12 boards and 5 blocks. The Gauchos were held to their lowest field-goal percentage in program history, converting on only 20.3 percent of shots.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t attack, we took some ill-advised shots, but we’ve got to get some touches in the paint, some kick-outs and some rhythm,” said Henrickson. “We need to execute down the stretch, get them off the glass.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos dropped their final regular season game in Hawaii, Santa Barbara holds a determined mindset heading into the postseason.</p>\n<p>“It’s not who you play, it’s not where you play, it’s how you play,” continued Henrickson. “And you’ve got to own your how. You’ve got to be dialed in, you’ve got to know what you’re doing, you’ve got to be disciplined. We’ve got to be committed to making fewer mistakes and forcing mistakes on the other end.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face either Riverside, Long Beach or Northridge on Wednesday, March 7, with tip-off scheduled for 8:30 p.m. With a win, UCSB advances to face either UC Davis or Cal Poly in the semifinals. Games will be broadcast on ESPN3 as the Gauchos aim to return to the Championship, where they lost to Long Beach last year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81810\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81810\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/following-first-round-bye-ucsb-wbb-is-set-to-face-lbsu-in-1st-game-of-big-west-tournament/","id":969,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[968,967,966],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift","biography":"Not available","articles":[32,33,42,202,203,206,218,221,598,603,655,675,681,691,696,747,770,781,819,837,838,846,865,898,938,944,945,946,950,969,997,1209,1212,1213,1214,1330,1836,1849,1871,4876,4887,4890,4908,4909,4910,4911,4912,4913,4914],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Ends Season, Earns Second Place","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In its final series of the season, the UCSB softball team completed a sweep of Cal State Northridge this past weekend to end on a seven-game winning streak.

Wisdom retired the first nine batters she faced in order as the Gaucho offense also struggled manufacturing a run. Not until the seventh were the Gauchos able to break through with RBI hits by junior outfielder Jessica Soria and sophomore second baseman Kathryn Pilpil to win 2-0.</p>\n<p>Only two Matador runners were able to reach base, both on fielding errors as Wisdom broke the school record for most strikeouts in a season in the process; she finished with 247 strikeouts on the season and 24 wins.</p>\n<p>“We expected [Wisdom] to do great things before she got here and she lived up to those expectations,” Galicinao said. “She’s really matured over the course of the year. It’s exciting we still have another three years with her.”</p>\n<p>With the season now over, the Gauchos will now turn their attention to next year where they will be lead by their two seniors, Jennings and Soria, and a talented supporting cast.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/","id":966,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[965,964,963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Tourney With Perfect Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB softball team started its season in winning fashion, as it was crowned tournament champions after a perfect 5-0 record at the Mardi Gras Classic in Louisiana this weekend to open the 2013 sea...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB softball team started its season in winning fashion, as it was crowned tournament champions after a perfect 5-0 record at the Mardi Gras Classic in Louisiana this weekend to open the 2013 season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started the tournament against Grambling State, easily defeating the Tigers 6-0.

In the sixth inning, Boser and Stark would score on errors and a single by Jennings would bring senior outfielder Jessica Soria in for her second run of the game. Junior pitcher Andriana Collins earned her first win of the season as the Gauchos gave up no runs in the final inning, winning 6-3.</p>\n<p>After the final game against Southeast Missouri State was canceled due to rain, a 5-0 record meant UCSB was named tournament champions.

Preaching for her players to play with “excellence and resiliency,” Galicinao has proven in the past that she can get her team to play at a high level.</p>\n<p>“Whether it’s during batting practice or taking reps defensively, our coach makes sure we keep our standards high and our mental game sharp,” Kane said. “We have players that know the game really well and at this level that’s what it comes down to, being smart players.”</p>\n<p>At the pitcher and catcher positions especially, UCSB will be showing off a bevy of new faces. Returning pitchers Andriana Collins and Shelby Wisdom are joined by freshmen Alex Pingree and Ashley Ludlow.</p>\n<p>Wisdom was one of the team’s standout players last year as a freshman, breaking the UCSB records for wins (24) and strikeouts (247). She was named First Team All-Big West and Freshman Field Player of the Year, pitching with an ERA of 2.31, throwing five shut-outs and a no hitter while still contributing on offense with a .271 batting average, 35 hits and five home runs.</p>\n<p>At catcher, UCSB will be using three freshmen in MeShalon Moore, Samantha Stark and Mariesa Davies.</p>\n<p>Senior Jessica Soria is joined in the outfield by freshman Arianna Palomares and junior McKenzie Kane. Soria was also named First Team All-Big West last season after leading the team in runs (29), hits (58) and stolen bases (25).</p>\n<p>The infield will be led by senior Shortstop Keilani Jennings and junior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil, who were both awarded Honorable Mention All-Big West last year. Junior Lauren Boser returns to play first base and junior Jessica Reichner starts at third base in her first game after transferring to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Out with injuries to start the season are utility players Jenessa Jeppesen and Dejanee Moore.
