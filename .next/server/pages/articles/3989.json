CSD) president.</p>\n<p>This amounts to $100 per meeting, regardless of the meeting’s length.</p>\n<p>The seven directors – Ethan Bertrand, Natalie Jordan, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Robert Geis and George Thurlow – will now also be reimbursed for any traveling expenses incurred while on I.V. CSD business.</p>\n<p>“Obviously this is not a living wage, this is not a big salary or anything. This this is just a basic payment,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“Public service is absolutely important and we’re privileged to do the work that we do, but we want to make sure that people who want to get involved in their community and serve in this capacity can have at least a little more assistance and financial security.”</p>\n<p>The resolution passed with four yes votes and one abstention by Director Thurlow.</p>\n<p>Directors also have the option to waive their payments or accept the money and immediately return it to the board, an option Thurlow said he would be following.</p>\n<p>There is approximately $16,800 in allocations for the year to compensate directors for their time, according to the I.V. CSD’s 2018-19 budget.</p>\n<p>The board has been discussing this for about two months, following an acquisition of the I.V. CSD’s funding through Measure R, Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD’s policy committee is creating a policy for what can be reimbursed. The committee will discuss this during its Policy Committee Regular meeting on Nov. 8.</p>\n<p>“This is something that will make service in the board of directors more inclusive,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“We recognize that we have very limited finances, and we want to be respectful of that while also making sure there’s a basic level of pay to just assist with the incredible amount of work that goes into this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Finance and Business Committee (F&amp;B) met in the State Street Room of the UCen on Monday to approve funding requests for 12 campus groups and discuss two internal bills.</p>\n<p>The current budget stands at $57,198.05 in Office Student Life (OSL), $8,665.26 in Senate Unallocated, $ 45,000 in Student Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP), $45,000 in Culture and Graduation, $30,000 in Sports Teams and $17,164 in Academic Teams.</p>\n<p>Fully funded groups included Active Minds for $1,802 in travel and hotel expenses for an organization conference, Gamma Phi Beta sorority for $1,770 for Crescent Classic Pancake Breakfast event, Pi Beta Phi sorority for $1,989 for Air Jam Dance Marathon, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) for $1,901 for a FBLA conference, Black Quare for $3,000 for Trans Revolution talk series and Surf Team for $3,000 in annual team costs.</p>\n<p>Partially funded groups included Zeta Phi Rho fraternity for $320 of $370 for a haunted house with Isla Vista Youth Projects, Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority for $735 of $835 for Kappa Dash 5K Color Run, International Student Association for $470 of $670 for ‘Go’ board game night and mixer and Hermanos Unidos for $1307 of $1370 for a community Thanksgiving dinner.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club’s request of $1,000 in furnishing for annual Beach Ball dance competition was tabled until the group finds additional sources of funding and furniture rental.</p>\n<p>Philanthropy Chair of Kappa Kappa Gamma and fourth-year communication and global studies double major Maggie Vlaco said the sorority will donate all proceeds from Kappa Dash 5K Color Run to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure breast cancer research foundation.</p>\n<p>“We started this 10 to 15 years ago because one of our members passed away from ovarian cancer while attending UCSB, so it’s in memoriam of her,” Vlaco said. “We had over 300 participants last year and we raised over $5,000.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Susana Abdurahman said bringing transgender activist Cece McDonald to the Trans Revolution series at UCSB is extremely significant to the queer community because McDonald is a black transgender woman who was imprisoned in a men’s prison after defending herself from a racist and transphobic attack.</p>\n<p>“By defending herself, the man who attacked her was killed, and she was put in a men’s prison for 19 months,” Abdurahman said. “We are really excited to bring someone who has been a phenomenal activist for black and trans rights to come have a conversation with us about prison reform.”</p>\n<p>Co-captain of UCSB Surf Team and second-year pre-communication major Stephanie Schechter said because the team does not receive sufficient funding from the university, individual athletes must pay registration fees for the National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA).</p>\n<p>“We have 14 national titles, but unfortunately we don’t receive very much funding or donations,” Schechter said. “Our team has to pay our own travel expenses. Our yearly costs are about $14,820, so we are requesting registration funds for NSSA.”</p>\n<p>Active Minds Co-Publicity Chair and Co-Events Chair Marisa Jones said it is an honor for UCSB representatives to speak at the national conference, which will focus on the organization’s goal of eliminating the stigma surrounding mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been a five-star chapter at UCSB for six years in a row,” Jones said. “Only a few chapters have been able to speak, so we’re excited to be able to represent UCSB.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65285\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"718504292\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65328\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65285\" data-attachment-id=\"65285\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/finance-and-business_-by-oliver-zuniga-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444626351\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"53\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance and Business_ by Oliver Zuniga-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-65285\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=800%2C533\" alt=\"Oliver Zuniga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Finance-and-Business_-by-Oliver-Zuniga-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65285\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oliver Zuniga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) collegiate senator and third-year CCS biochemistry and bioengineering major Dustin Larrazolo motioned a discussion about funding for Greek organizations, saying there should be a lower funding limit for Interfraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic events.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that all IFC or Pan groups are one entity, but I don’t think Greek organizations should be getting these blank checks,” Larrazolo said. “I also believe this is a conflict of interest because there are IFC members here. It doesn’t seem entirely appropriate; if we do fund [Greek organizations] there should be a smaller cap.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo also said A.S funds should be reserved for students who require funding to attend the university.</p>\n<p>“I think these funds should be going toward students of color, undocumented students, students who require resources to continue attending the university as opposed to building up haunted house for I.V. Youth,” Larrazolo said. “I think that’s great, but it’s not our job to be a sponsor.”</p>\n<p>Chief Financial Officer of F&amp;B Kevin Koo said he does not oppose the allocation of funds to Greek organizations because they comprise a large portion of the student population.</p>\n<p>“They are accessing a lot of students and they are raising a lot of money. It’s beneficial for the community and the school,” Koo said. “I think the bigger issue is if philanthropies fall within our guidelines — if they do, I don’t see a problem with that.”</p>\n<p>Assistant Director for Finance and Budgets Cindy Lopez told F&amp;B about A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal’s plans to reallocate $9,000 from the A.S. Leadership fund to use for professional development.</p>\n<p>Senator Larrazolo also introduced a Bill to Redefine the A.S. Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital Fund (S.T.A.R.K.), amending the bill to allocate $4,000 dollars to the CCS student council and $4,000 dollars to the College of Engineering student council. According to Larrazolo, the current S.T.A.R.K. fund is meant to stimulate science research but is generally discussed in A.S. senate meetings rather than made accessible to CCS and the College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>“I can’t speak for the College of Engineering, but through CCS we require students to participate at a quarterly symposium at CCS,” Larrazolo said. “When someone receives funding we want to make sure they’ve actually made progress and [are] completing their mission statement.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65328\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65328\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-discusses-funds-for-campus-groups/","id":3986,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[3985,3984,3983],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2018 Midterm Election Results: Santa Barbara County Victories","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2018-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/livemidtermresults-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/livemidtermresults-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus compiled information about several winners and passing measures from Tuesday's midterm election. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The <em>Nexus</em> compiled information about several winners and passing measures from last night’s midterm election. Read about their campaign promises and what they plan to do during their times in their respective offices below:</p>\n<p><strong>Governor Gavin Newsom</strong></p>\n<p>Gavin Newsom (D), former San Francisco major and lieutenant governor of California, won the gubernatorial seat in the 2018 midterm election. Newsom campaigned in support of expanding healthcare, diminishing the National Rifle Association’s (NRA) influence on legislation, protecting California’s status as a sanctuary state, closing the gender pay gap and protecting women’s reproductive rights, according to his campaign website.</p>\n<p>His platform consists of expanding economic growth through a new job training system, improving infrastructure and maintaining California values of diversity and social equality.</p>\n<p>He won against his Republican opponent, John Cox.</p>\n<p><strong>Secretary of State Alex Padilla</strong></p>\n<p>Alex Padilla (D) was elected for a second term as secretary of state. During his campaign, he directed voters to his previous terms as secretary of state, state senator and president of Los Angeles City Council.</p>\n<p>Padilla said in his candidate statement that his work in the last four years helped to register millions of eligible voters in California. He pointed to his beginnings as the son of immigrant parents with blue-collar jobs as an indication of his commitment to working-class families.</p>\n<p>He won over the majority of voters against his opponent, Mark Meuser (R).</p>\n<p><strong>California Senator Dianne Feinstein</strong></p>\n<p>Now officially elected to her fifth term in the U.S. Senate, Dianne Feinstein (D) ran on a progressive platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Feinstein cited her experience in the position in previous years for issues including immigrants’ rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and universal healthcare.</p>\n<p>She promised to attack prerogatives of the Trump Agenda such as his anti-immigration policies and proposed oil drilling permits off California’s coast, according to her candidate statement in the 2018 Voter Guide.</p>\n<p>Feinstein won the majority vote against her opponent, Kevin de León (D).</p>\n<p><strong>24th Congressional District Representative Salud Carbajal</strong></p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara alumnus Salud Carbajal won the majority vote for representative of California’s 24th congressional district for a second term. Carbajal campaigned on creating cooperation between Republicans and Democrats to support the Central Valley.</p>\n<p>He pledged to advocate for the middle class, fight for environmental protection, push for safer gun laws and regulations, help to make higher education more affordable, create higher-paying job opportunities and strengthen Medicare and social security.</p>\n<p>He won against his opponent, Justin Fareed (R).</p>\n<p><strong>State Assembly 37th District Representative Monique Limón</strong></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara native and Goleta resident Monique Limón won another term as representative of the 37th state assembly district. She campaigned on her years of experience in higher education, especially at UCSB working in various departments to increase diversity and assist in transitions from college to graduate school.</p>\n<p>She promised to advocate for education, defend the environment and expand opportunities for job training and internships, according to her campaign websites.</p>\n<p>She won the majority in a landslide vote against her opponent, David Norrdin (D).</p>\n<p><strong>Goleta Union School District</strong></p>\n<p>Luz Reyes-Martin, Richard Mayer and Carin Ezal all won seats in the Goleta Union School District race.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure G2018 County Ordinance</strong></p>\n<p>Measure G proposed a redistricting of Santa Barbara County which would be spearheaded by the Santa Barbara Citizens’ Independent Redistricting Commission. The measure will establish clear procedures for determining electoral district boundaries within the county.</p>\n<p>The commission leading the redistricting will be designed to be free of influence from campaign contributors, political parties, special financial interests and more as well as be representative of diversity in the county.</p>\n<p><strong>Measure Z2018 City Goleta Cannabis Tax</strong></p>\n<p>Measure Z passed overwhelmingly in the midterm elections, placing a tax on cannabis businesses in Goleta to provide revenue to be used by the city of Goleta.</p>\n<p>The measure will impose taxes on individual processes of the cannabis industry in Goleta, including cannabis distribution/transportation, cannabis cultivation and cannabis processing/manufacturing. It will exclude the sale of medical cannabis and cannabis testing.</p>\n<p>The tax is expected to go into effect 10 days after the vote is declared by the city council, according to the Measure Z ordinance.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [Nov. 21]: Luz Reyes-Martin, Richard Mayer and Carin Ezal all won seats within the Goleta Union School District. A previous version of this article stated Reyes-Martin was the sole winner.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

CSD and the university have made small steps toward regulating the electric scooters that often end up scattered on sidewalks, in the ocean or on bike paths.</p>\n<p>At the I.V. CSD’s Tuesday meeting, the board discussed further problems with the scooters, as well as the county’s proposed regulation of them.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County first put limited regulations on the scooters back in November, requiring electric scooter companies to obtain encroachment permits to operate within the county’s boundaries among other stipulations.</p>\n<p>The companies are also required to monitor their fleets, retrieve the scooters “as needed” and manage the number of scooters out, according to a press release sent out by the county in early November. The changes went into effect early December.</p>\n<p>In I.V., the county has also approached the idea of parking zones for the scooters, I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>The county will also implement an annual permit fee, a monthly per-vehicle fee and an impound fee for the companies to pay.</p>\n<p>“The county is going to be a lot more active and they’re kind of tying it to the outdoor space,” Abboud said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>He noted that the county is taking some of the I.V. CSD’s suggestions into account.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the county has now capped the number of scooters per company in I.V. at 200, according to I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>Brandt said that the CSD has also met with Santa Barbara County Supervisor Joan Hartmann to discuss different ways of transportation in I.V.</p>\n<p>UCPD faces its own share of problems when it comes to the scooters.</p>\n<p>Despite the app’s warning that the scooters are not allowed on campus, a threat of a $200 ticket and UCSB’s strict interim policy banning all of the scooters from campus, the department continues to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-15/ucpd-ups-enforcement-of-electric-scooter-violations/\">impound</a> hundreds of scooters, according to Bowman.</p>\n<p>Lime recently picked up 147 of their scooters from UCPD, but there are still currently 253 Bird scooters in impound. UCPD charges the company $24 a scooter to retrieve them.</p>\n<p>Lime has done a better job than Bird of retrieving scooters and communicating with the university, according to Bowman.</p>\n<p>A Lime representative has been in touch with Bowman to set up an event in Isla Vista to teach residents how to safely use the scooters, and has even offered to move Bird scooters off campus, Bowman said.</p>\n<p>UCPD is currently discussing what to do with the scooters that are not picked up by the companies within the allotted time frame. For example, the department has discussed the idea of dismantling the scooters and recycling the batteries, Bowman said.</p>\n<p>UCSB also created a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/birds-wings-clipped-electric-scooter-ban-in-place-on-campus/\"> policy committee</a> in October to discuss how to address scooters on campus. The committee then floated the idea of geofencing the scooters to help with regulation.</p>\n<p>However, the committee has not yet created a new policy regarding the scooters, according to Jennifer Lofthus, UCSB policy coordinator, ADA compliance and privacy officer.</p>\n<p>“We also continue to keep an eye on statewide concerns and methods of addressing the impacts of the scooters on communities such as ours,” Lofthus said in an email.</p>\n<p>“The committee will convene again at some point in Winter Quarter to discuss but that meeting has not yet been scheduled.”</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 10 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at evelyn@dailynexus.com or news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
