The Gauchos finished last season as the No. 5 team in the country with an 18-10 record, racking up several impressive wins over the course of the year. Some victories that stood out include 3-0 sweeps of No. 3 BYU on back-to-back days, a 3-2 win vs. No. 2 UCLA and a 3-1 win over then-No. 5 Loyola Chicago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the Gauchos will be without several key players who graduated, including standout outside hitter Corey Chavers, opposite Matt Ujkic and outside hitter/libero Hayden Boehle. Chavers led the Gauchos in 2019 with 370 kills with a season average of 3.4 kills per set. Boehle saw some notoriety for his impressive season, finishing as a finalist for the Erik Shoji Award, an honor given to the best Libero in all of collegiate men’s volleyball. Both Chavers and Boehle earned Second-Team All-American honors for their strong play in their final college season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the loss of these valuable pieces, UCSB should continue to play good volleyball, bringing back seven players for their fourth and final run as Gauchos. Notable returning seniors for UCSB include opposite Spencer Fredrick out of Lynwood, California, setter Casey McGarry and outside hitter Roy McFarland. My preseason presumption is that UCSB shouldn’t have many on-court chemistry imbalances or leadership blunders, given that these seniors have now been playing with one another for around four years.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with these seniors, an exciting prospect is returning to UCSB for his second season. Ryan Wilcox earned Freshman of the Year honors in the Big West Conference for his outstanding play as an outside hitter. Wilcox finished the 2019 year ranked No. 2 on the team in kills (254) and digs (121). Along with this, he was awarded Big West Freshman of the Week honors four times throughout the year. If UCSB wants continuous success this season, Wilcox should be a focal point of their offensive attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB comes into the new decade ranked No. 2 in the Big West Conference, with high hopes that they will compete in the conference championship game. The Gaucho men’s team kicks off their 2020 season this weekend as they host the Asics Invitational. This is the third consecutive year UCSB has hosted the tournament, with this year including UCSB, Long Beach State, Cal State Northridge, Concordia, Mckendree and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benedictine Mesa. The Gauchos square off against Concordia in their season opener. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, the Gauchos went 3-0 in this tournament racking up wins against Harvard, Grand Canyon and Concordia. Santa Barbara is hopeful to have similar success in this year’s tournament. UCSB’s opening round match versus Concordia tips off at 3 p.m. on Thursday; on the following day, Santa Barbara hosts </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benedictine University at Mesa at 5:30 p.m. Finally, they wrap up their series of games with Mckendree at 8 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to support the UCSB men’s volleyball team, all of the games will be hosted in Rob Gym this weekend.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

performance was the second-highest of her career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea on defense is that every ball is yours,” Fleck said after the game. “I feel like I went into the match with a really, really good mindset. I know who my hitters are, I know what my responsibilities are and every single ball on this court is my ball and I’m going to support my hitters. I’m going to dig these balls so that our offense can [do its job]. It was really just all a mindset for everyone on this team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB proceeded to topple Texas State in digs 70-54, making for a much stronger foundation for the offense to work through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janell Fitzgerald of the Bobcats, who posted 12 kills at a .267 rate, was the only member of her team to score more than 10 kills. The Gauchos, meanwhile, had two such players in Froley and Ruddins and they combined for 36 kills and a .335 efficiency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A seesaw first set eventually settled with both teams locked at 20-20 before the Gauchos would end it with a 5-1 run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas State garnered quite a bit of momentum and found themselves up 19-13 late in the second. A timeout by Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch halted the Bobcat offense, and another magical 12-2 run by the Gauchos won them the second set. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB went on to win 3-1 (25-21, 25-21, 20-25, 25-14) and were now headed for the second round with a very tough Texas team standing in their way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holding a 2-1 lead after three sets, the Gauchos (23-6) became the first team to win two sets against Texas (23-3) at home this season, and it was the first time Texas lost a set at home in the NCAA Tournament since 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas broke the game of pong with a four-point run to take a 20-17 advantage late in the first. And with that extra margin for error, they would go on to take the opener 25-22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos settled in and found victory in each of the next two sets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really handled the ball well and we ran it fast and we were really in sync with that,” Welch pointed out postgame.</span></p>\n<p><b> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Longhorns hit just .242 in the third while the Gauchos cruised to a phenomenal .548 with 18 kills and just one error. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a 2-1 lead over the No. 2 ranked team in the nation, UCSB was looking mightily tenacious and held a significant advantage in hitting percentage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite possibly the best start any UCSB fan could have hoped for, Texas found a way to put together a comeback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Longhorns shot an errorless .462 with 18 kills to take the fourth set after having only trailed 1-0 at the start.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They would ultimately take the fifth set, and the match, with a 15-10 victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of the greatest players in UCSB history, Ruddins will end her career as the all-time leader in kills, points and attempts in the rally scoring era and second all-time in kills in program history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It means so much to be a Gaucho, being here for the last five years, just seeing this program take such huge strides,” she said postgame. “Five years ago we were not at this point, and just to be able to see the progress and to be able to witness where this program is going is incredible and I hope that I impacted all of my teammates in a positive way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s always tough to say good-bye, but it is no secret that losing the greats hurts a different way. UCSB will also be sending thank you cards to Torre Glasker, Chloe Allen and Charlie Robinson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately for the Gauchos, they have a bright future in store, safe in the hands of a young core in sophomores Fleck and Lovenberg and freshmen Froley, Romoni Vivao and Deni Wilson, whose performances revealed they are very much ahead of their time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB ends this season with the most wins, and its first NCAA tournament win, since 2004. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s definitely something to be proud of. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

phenomenal 22-win season wasn’t enough to taste glory in the Big West, their being selected to partake in this famous competition shows how far this squad has come under the direction of Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch and, perhaps, how far the conference has come. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) {

the helm. The performance earned UCSB their first Big West championship in eight years and their first NCAA postseason appearance since 2010. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos then proceeded to finish with three sub-.500 overall records in the next four years, including an abysmal 3-13 conference record in 2015. Fortunately for Welch, the 2018 arrivals of then-freshmen Zoe Fleck, Tallulah Froley, Olivia Lovenberg and Gigi Ruddins were bolstering for the team, to say the least. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB followed up 2017’s 8-20 campaign with a 17-12 overall, 9-7 conference record showing in 2018, moving from 6th to 4th in the conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year was another monumental step for the Gaucho program. Veterans and rookies alike were evidently itching to feast, steamrolling the competition as they charged to a 13-game win streak that started in September. Hawai’i was the culprit, viciously breaking UCSB’s stronghold over the conference with a 3-0 sweep at the Thunderdome in October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished 2019 with a 22-5 overall, 12-4 conference record, concluding Welch’s seventh season as a Gaucho. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just one (more) loss to Hawai’i, one to Cal Poly and one to Long Beach State in the final 6 games of conference play was enough to hand the Gauchos bronze in the Big West in their first 20-win campaign since 2009 and their best since Welch’s arrival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB’s overall record is the best it has been in a decade, it’s perhaps even more telling that they coupled that with a 12-4 showing in the conference, a record one game worse than in their 2013 championship season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stats will do little to appease the squad, who I’d imagine are still mulling their most recent losses, but the stars are shining for a club that is obviously good enough to hang with the best. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing is, will they hang with the best or will they be the best? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NCAA tournament is the perfect showcase for Welch and her squad to prove that they can beat the best. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas State enters the tournament as champions of the Sun Belt Conference, finishing with a 24-8 overall, 14-2 conference record. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be Texas State’s 11th appearance in the competition and their third time qualifying since entering the Sun Belt in 2013. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With five straight wins, they are just rolling through teams right now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is more disparity in the Sun Belt, though, and when you look at a combined table of the Sun Belt and the Big West, you’ll find that Hawai’i, Cal Poly and UCSB are all in the top 5 places. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will be looking to catch Texas State off guard, and nothing would be more significant than a quick first-set victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas State is led by senior outside hitter Cheyenne Huskey, who finished 2019 with 416 kills off a .245 clip. Gaucho senior outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins finished with 398 kills but did so at a .278 rate, good for 51 fewer errors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the assistant chefs, Bobcat Emily DeWalt finished with an astonishing 1,158 helpers but was the only player on her squad to dish out more than 100.

It was Labor Day; we were in a cabin at Tahoe. I was unprepared, it was premature and yes, I bled. That weekend in sixth grade, I became the first of my friends to get my period. At a scrappy Chevron on the way home, my friend’s mom Lisa taught me how to put a pad on my underwear.<br><br>“Then you fold the wings down,” she yelled at me through the cracks of the public restroom. She paused, then lowered her voice to a whisper. “And you’ll <em>feel</em> it when it comes out.” <br><br>It sounded almost pleasurable, the prurient way she said it. I had dozed off during our barebones sex ed class in fifth grade, so upon first seeing those unfamiliar red spots on my ash-white shorts, my imagination ran rampant. I envisioned a sort of magical oil slick oozing neatly into a sanitary pad, to be expected and practiced as an annual fertility rite of womanhood. I surmised that it would happen twice a year, tops, probably aligning with the cosmic patterns of celestial orbs. There was probably a farmer’s almanac I could borrow at the middle school library to help me predict my period next year. Then, I learned that I come from a long line of uteruses that expel blood with the urgency of a firefighter’s hose. I adopted my mother’s many strategies: mesh underwear, double lining pads, sleepless nights on top of the dark towel. <br><br>That summer, my mom and I went on an impromptu European mother-daughter trip. In Rome, during a free Mozart opera concert that bored me to no end, my mom’s eyes widened slightly in surprise. She did not break her gaze from the warbling singers. “Aiya,” she said calmly. “The disaster has come.” I panicked for her. No, she said, she didn’t have any hygienic provisions with her. No, she didn’t have any black pants to change into. Yes, she had bled through. I looked at her khaki trousers that had seemed so smart and graceful moments earlier, and cursed them for her. We conspired to leave the concert with quick paces, me walking mere inches behind her like a sticky shadow.<br><br>Companies like Procter &amp; Gamble (which owns Always, Tampax, Naturella, and Whisper) target women of different countries with different products. The French want the least bulky, the Japanese want the softest material, and Americans want maximum security against leakage, regardless of cost in comfort. When we neared the light of street lamps, I could see the little stains on either side of her crotch, hiding in the creases of her pants as she walked, like a blinking, winking, eyebrow-raising face that mocked our embarrassment. Did the Italianos around us notice? Would they stand and point and laugh at her if they saw her stains? What if we were walking under American streetlights?<br><br>Menstruation is an ongoing civil war waged in between my legs, my ruined underwear its tired battlefield. Month after month, my body triumphantly declares victory over my will. I looked towards a higher power. What could calm the fury that overtook my body every 28 days? God, maybe, or yoga? I dabbled in both to no avail. My pediatrician warily prescribed me birth control and I started Sprintec, a waxy blue envelope of little round pills which is now my constant companion. Sometimes, when I forget to pepper the pill at precisely 9 p.m., I have my period for two straight months. I envied the women whose periods are so infrequent that they buy pregnancy tests. I envied Olympic gymnasts, whose extreme athleticism causes secondary amenorrhea. I envied those without uteruses and I resented their oblivion to our suffering. <br><br>I grew to dread my period, a deep self-hatred dappled with anxiety from frantically shuffling towards the bathroom with a hidden tampon up my sleeve or subtly glancing at my seat every time I stood up. Periods were terrible to start at school. By lunchtime, I’d convene with my friends. “I bled through,” I’d say glumly, defeated yet again. In a practiced ritual, they’d pat me on the shoulder with a sympathetic look. Lisa was right. I felt it. I felt too dirty to exist in public when I was bleeding. <br><br>We bargain with our reflections in the mirror, playing with the cards we were dealt: the cleft chin from your father, the curly hair from your mother, the hooded eyes, the pixie ears, the color of your skin in the winter. Variances of periods are many: menstruation can begin as early as age eight, lasts from two to seven days per cycle and occurs every 21 to 45 days. Periods can be viscous or thin, staining your favorite clothes any shade of crimson and brown. Thus, the period is the last manifestation of this genetic destiny, a hormonal sorting hat declaring your birth-given menstrual fate. As I anticipate the monthly shedding of my uterine lining, I’m reminded of my biological duty to reproduce, my position as almost-mother and future-mother and, at the risk of empathizing with the pro-life movement, my body’s power to create conscious life. No joy can be derived from apologizing for bleeding, sorry after sorry to my light-wash Levi’s and my Advil-scarred stomach. We do not shame the injured for their gushing wounds and broken bones, yet as I’m hurt, month after month, I nurse myself in secrecy. Menstruation is a woman’s first introduction to labor needlessly for the comfort of others.<br><br>When I was 17, I got a Diva Cup. The silicone wonder arrived at my door in a purple box with curlicue writing urging me to join the revolution: “A Better Period Experience,” it promised. The instructions are written in exquisite detail, specifying the locations of the labia and the cervix, as if its user did not know what a vagina is; the Diva Cup knew that many women are strangers to the intricate pains and pleasures of their own bodies. There was no shame in not knowing yet. Holding it by its ribbed stem, the cup is roughly tulip-sized and supple to the touch. Instructions demand some origami first: fold the cup in half from top down or into a U-shape. Then, a choreographed tango: angle the pelvis to the cup in sitting position as you insert, rotating it to ensure a solid seal. If vaginas were capable of feeling anxiety, mine did. As I pushed the Diva Cup in for its maiden voyage, I feared the worst. It might get swallowed up in that orifice and I might have to ask my mom to take me to the ER. It could crumble inside my vagina and probably somehow enter my bloodstream. The cup might turn over, liberating a deluge of blood in the middle of my Russian Literature seminar. It might hurt. Silly doubts, I realize now. The cup felt like nothing and my first period with the Diva Cup was a fucking miracle. Either God or yoga took pity on me; I was no longer drowning in a pool of my own blood and shame.<br><br>Oh, how can I count the ways I love thee, Diva Cup? Besides the physical security in its flawless, ingenious function, the cup is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, safe, comfortable, and convenient alternative. Am I a hormonal Diva for my unorthodox approach to reigning in my menstrual flow? Or is this cup the Diva that translates the dramatic theatre of my cycle to a secret power? I perused their website. “The name Diva originates in Italy, where it was used to describe a female deity, a powerful woman whose talent resembles that of the gods. In the 1800s the name Diva was used to describe a talented woman, leading the way in music and stage. What better way to empower women than by encouraging them to become a menstrual Diva – a leader in period care!”<br><br>Ah. I’m in a harmonious collaboration with menstruation. Ours is a masterpiece worthy of Carnegie and Pompidou. I feel it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kat Chen wants you to buy a Diva Cup for someone you love. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.
