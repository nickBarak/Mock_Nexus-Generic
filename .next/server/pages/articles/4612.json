More than a dozen organizations collaborated to put on the event with activities like face painting, bounce house and Halloween-themed games.</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and fourth-year math and Spanish double major Sonia Acuna said the annual event provides a fun and safe place for local children to enjoy Halloween.</p>\n<p>“It’s a tradition to have it every year, to have a safe space for children to come play and celebrate Halloween,” Acuna said. “Obviously, in Isla Vista it isn’t always the best place to go trick-or-treating on Halloween night, so we try to bring it to them even though it’s the weekend before.”</p>\n<p>La Escuelita co-chair and fourth-year statistics major Jose Neri said students often forget there are many families who live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Halloween in I.V. is very party-like, and it’s not a very ideal place for kids to go trick-or-treating,” Neri said. “Also, most students here don’t have candy to give out to little kids, so that’s why we do this for the little kids.”</p>\n<p>Acuna said Safe Halloween is made possible through the support of local organizations.</p>\n<p>“We invited them all to have a booth or little activity for the kids to play and have fun,” Acuna said. “It’s really awesome to have them here. There’s about 15 or 16 orgs here right now… it fills up the park and it feels nice to have their support here.”</p>\n<p>Lambda Theta Alpha member and third-year Chican@ studies major Cristina Cota said she and her sorority sisters were “excited to participate” in Safe Halloween.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really great opportunity for children who don’t really have access to the typical Halloween trick-or-treating experience in their neighborhood that you would see on T.V. or that you grow up with in a hometown,” Cota said.</p>\n<p>Acuna said IVRPD, Community Affairs Board (CAB), and Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) contributed funds to Safe Halloween.</p>\n<p>“[IVRPD] covered a fee of about almost $300,” Acuna said. “We’re here because they helped us with that. I know CAB is donating money as well and IVCRC is also donating money, so this is possible with a lot of help from IVRPD, CAB and IVCRC.”</p>\n<p>Cota said it is important for students to be involved in I.V. community events like Safe Halloween during their time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for the community of Isla Vista because it shows that there’s a whole different side to us,” Cota said. “It’s really important for us to really nurture that and make sure that they get the best experience that they can, and it’s not just about coming here just to go to school, it’s also about giving back to the community.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Courtesy of St. George</p></div>\n<p>Independent housing developer Ed St. George of St. George Associates introduced a proposal earlier this year to convert Beach City apartments on Cliff Drive into dorms for Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) students.</p>\n<p>St. George plans to renovate the two-story apartments by adding a third story to accommodate up to 1,500 SBCC students. Existing kitchens will be removed for more space, and a new shared dining commons will be added. The proposal is currently in the second pre-application process under the City of Santa Barbara Planning Division.</p>\n<p>Planning Division Project Planner Daniel Gullett said the Santa Barbara Planning Commission will review the early concept of the project.</p>\n<p>“The applicant will be submitting another pre-application in January because there are so many large issues to address,” Gullett said. “The applicant will get more feedback from city staff and then put together a formal application.”</p>\n<p>Gullett said the Planning Commission is taking special caution with the proposal because the project is a new concept for the city.</p>\n<p>“It’s a unique project for the city. We don’t have any dormitories, and this particular project requires a conditional use permit from the Planning Commission,” Gullett said. “So there is a lot of discretion in the review. It would be the only dormitory in the city.”</p>\n<p>Gullett said the application process may take years to approve because the project is unique to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“City council would have to approve the zone change and land use designation change to allow for the height, and Coastal Commission would have to certify,” Gullett said. “The design would also have to be approved by the Architectural Board of Review.”</p>\n<p>Suzanne Elledge Planning and Permitting Services Principal Planner Laurel Perez said the firm is currently developing the second pre-application package, which they will submit in early January.</p>\n<p>“We’ve engaged traffic and parking consultants, a project biologist and project archeologist that will look at the cultural resources that might be present on site,” Perez said. “We’re completing those technical studies that will help address many of the questions that the city has identified in relationship to this project.”</p>\n<p>According to Perez, the project is still in its early stages and will continue to address concerns such as parking issues, noise and neighborhood compatibility.</p>\n<p>“Ed St. George’s primary objective for this project is to create a student environment that positively interacts with the local community,” Perez said. “Hopefully together we can come up with a project that addresses community concerns and help to meet a long overdue student housing need.”</p>\n<p>Perez said many other community colleges in the nation are facing similar housing issues because of increasing enrollment.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised to learn that this is not a unique situation that SBCC is facing,” Perez said. “We are seeing an increase in the number of students who are attending a community college that provide excellent education.”</p>\n<p>According to SBCC President Lori Gaskin, less than 15 of the 113 colleges in the California Community College system have dormitories.</p>\n<p>“Dormitories are not funded by the state for community colleges and are not part of the mission,” Gaskin said. “Those [community colleges with dorms] tend to be in locations that are very remote or are servicing remote geographic regions.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said Beach City Apartments are close to campus but unaffiliated with the college.</p>\n<p>“It existed for a long time, but this particular developer bought it a couple of years ago and is seeking to increase the capacity of living apartments,” Gaskin said.<br>\nGaskin said the proposal might help with low vacancy rates and high rental fees in Santa Barbara, which have impacted student enrollment rates at SBCC since 2009.</p>\n<p>“This fall semester we are down in enrollment by over four percent. When we reached out to potential students on why they applied but chose not to enroll, they talked about the cost of living,” Gaskin said. “The cost of living competes with the cost of going to school, so it’s really hard on our students.”</p>\n<p>SBCC student and third-year communication major Allie Trice said it was easy for her to find housing in Isla Vista because she had friends from UCSB living in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I chose to live here because all of my friends lived here since they went to UCSB. I didn’t really have any friends at SBCC,” Trice said. “It was convenient. It was nice already knowing people living here.”</p>\n<p>Trice said housing in I.V. and the Santa Barbara area is expensive because of its proximity to the beach.</p>\n<p>“When I first moved down here, I was like, ‘Wow. I’m paying for living in a double as much as you’d pay for a whole apartment where I’m from,’” Trice said. “I understand that it’s expensive because we live right down the street from the beach.”</p>\n<p>Trice said the proposal would be a convenient option for SBCC students struggling to find affordable housing near campus.</p>\n<p>“I would never personally do it because I like living [in I.V.],” Trice said. “But I know that would be a really good option for many students, because I know that at city college, there is a struggle to get housing there, and it’s expensive as well.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, November 19, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66624\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66624\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/st-george-proposes-sbcc-dorm-plan/","id":4609,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[4608,4607,4606],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yoga Studio Opens in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Yoga_by-Vivian-Bui-1-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Yoga_by-Vivian-Bui-1-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Yoga Isla Vista opened Saturday above Silvergreens at 900 Embarcadero del Mar, with a studio opening and blessing ceremony hosted by cofounders John Smart, a UCSB alum, and Julie Smart.

The grand opening included a demonstration of a Kundalini yoga class for attendees and performances by Sukhdev Jackson of the musical group Aykanna and local singer and songwriter Gabriel Kelly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident and Yin Yoga instructor at Yoga Isla Vista Dolliane Lipman said the studio will offer an opportunity for I.V. residents to participate in a neighborhood activity.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really great idea to have a yoga community in Isla Vista, just somewhere people can come and … heal, because there’s a lot of negative stuff that’s happened here,” Lipman said.</p>\n<p>Yoga instructor at Yoga Isla Vista Peter Stephan said many of the instructors connect deeply to Kundalini yoga, a tradition Yogi Bhajan brought to the west in 1968. According to Stephan, Kundalini yoga focuses on conscious experience.</p>\n<p>“Kundalini is the yoga of awareness, there’s a real emphasis on the community… and it incorporates all the other styles of yoga,” Stephan said. “Kundalini is all about the direct, personal experience.”<br>\nStephan said he encourages students and I.V. residents to try yoga even if they are unsure about the activity.</p>\n<p>“My advice would be to show up and experience the technology. It’s a science because there are steps that, if taken, give guaranteed results. It’s simply about taking those steps,” Stephan said. “This science can help us dissolve the illusion of who we think we are.”</p>\n<p>Smart, who graduated from UCSB in 2003, said he began yoga to seek relief from a hectic career in the film industry.</p>\n<p>“My first passion in life was surfing, I was a semi-professional/professional surfer. And when I went off into the real world to get a job in the film industry… I wasn’t getting the same physical activity that I got through surfing,” Smart said. “So I first came to yoga to help me deal with working 12, 14, 18-hour days. It was the most strenuous job I could have dreamed of.”</p>\n<p>Smart said yoga helped bring calm to his life and inspired him to open his own studio.</p>\n<p>“That was a lot of stress for the body, mind, and spirit. So, trying to finding a balance there, I just had to have a personal practice,” Smart said. “That’s how I found yoga and a daily practice, to counterbalance that chaos,” Smart said.</p>\n<p>Smart said while he and the instructors have roots in Kundalini yoga, Yoga Isla Vista will offer many styles of yoga to best serve each individual.</p>\n<p>“We’re not just doing Kundalini, we’re doing all different types, because we believe that everybody has a different path. We just want to offer authentic forms of yoga; we’re not a corporate yoga, it’s not a gym workout,” Smart said. “We’re just offering a slice of different traditions, so the community and students within it can be exposed to it and gravitate towards whatever tradition they like.”</p>\n<p>According to Smart, Kundalini yoga helps individuals attain a flowing mindset rather than a fixed one, and encourages people to follow their intuitions.</p>\n<p>“To me, we can approach life in two ways. One is, ‘my way or the highway.’ The other is to surrender to the flow and that natural, tiny voice that’s saying ‘go this way, don’t go that way,’” Smart said. “That’s the voice we’re trying to listen to, that passionate, energetic guide.”</p>\n<p>Smart said his goal is to share the yogic tradition rather than control it, and encourages campus clubs to continue their activities.</p>\n<p>“We’re not here to monopolize yoga; that’s totally against the tradition. The idea is that it spreads,” Smart said.</p>\n<p>Smart said he hopes the studio will impact I.V. in a positive, life-changing way.</p>\n<p>“The whole purpose was to give this community and college kids the tools they need for life … and there’s certain things that aren’t taught in school, unfortunately,” Smart said. “So that they have it in their tool kit, so they can live happier, healthier, holier lives — ‘holy’ meaning kind, loving, compassionate, realizing you’re part of a bigger whole and you’re grateful for that.”</p>\n<p>First-year financial mathematics and statistics major Caroline Cubero said yoga is a source of tranquility for her during stressful times, and the she wants to look into taking classes at the studio.</p>\n<p>“I did yoga over the summer, and it really calms me down. It helps me get all of my stress out and I feel so much better at the end of the day. Especially if I’m having a really bad day, it helps to reduce my stress. I definitely want to check it out,” Cubero said.</p>\n<p>Kundalini Yoga student Cy Cascade said setting aside inhibitions with an open mind is the first step to benefiting from yoga.</p>\n<p>“When you first come to class, you’re gonna be greeted by your teacher, who probably doesn’t look like a typical yoga teacher in the spandex or yoga pants,” Cascade said. “You have to let go of your preconceived notions that ‘this is weird’…you have to get past yourself. Which opens you up to being available to experience the amazing rewards.”</p>\n<p>Classes at Yoga Isla Vista will begin Monday, Nov. 2 with a special two-week student trial period for $25.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

By the end of the evening, the surfaces of the paper lanterns were covered with pictures, songs and simple words such as “I.V. Strong.”</p>\n<p>The memorial events were smaller this year than last, allowing students to address the anniversary and heal in personal ways.</p>\n<p>“I think people just want a space — a space to heal and space to just do whatever they want that is going to benefit them the best — rather than having an organized official event,” Madeline Berger, third-year art and theater double major and student leader for the “Blunite” memorial, said.</p>\n<p>She said the canvases celebrated the life of each student and allowed visitors to acknowledge loss, even if they did not personally know the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think having dedicated spaces like the canvases really do make it a little more connected to each individual that we lost, but … there is no reason you have to connect yourself to exactly one victim,” Berger said. “There [were] tons of people that got hurt, got injured, got shot but recovered … but it was still a part of our community and it still happened to them.”</p>\n<p>Berger described the media attention from last year’s memorial as “overwhelming” and said this year’s gathering was just as special. She believes future anniversaries will be more “private and personal” as the community learns to heal over the passing years.</p>\n<p>“I think that a lot of the feelings that I’ve been getting from people are just, ‘I need to be able to express it however I am going to express it,’” Berger said. “There doesn’t need to be something big or grand … it can be something as simple as making tea light bags.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/","id":4611,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[4610,4609,4608],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
