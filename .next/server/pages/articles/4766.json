Although a CSD would traditionally need authorization from LAFCO, Williams’ bill bypasses that requirement in favor of approval by the state legislature in light of LAFCO’s disapproval of past I.V. self-governance efforts.</p>\n<p>Historically, every submission to LAFCO to turn I.V. into a CSD or give it other forms of local government has failed, with the commission rejecting CSD petitions for I.V. in 1972, 1975 and 1983 largely due to concerns over financial feasibility. The letter to be discussed next Thursday, written by Third District Supervisor and LAFCO Vice Chair Doreen Farr, expressed the commission’s concern about its lack of involvement in the approval process as well as issues regarding yet unwritten language of the bill and the role of landowners in the proposed CSD.</p>\n<p>“It appears that in its current form, AB 3 intends to bypass the LAFCO District formation process, which is of great concern to CALAFCO and the Santa Barbara LAFCO,” the letter states. “The bill does not state which services and powers are envisioned for a CSD. Usually CSDs fold in existing districts. Are new services envisioned?”</p>\n<p>Chair of the I.V. Property Owners Association Chuck Eckert said that establishment of a CSD for I.V. is unnecessary because the services needed to improve I.V. “already exist.”</p>\n<p>“The position of the property owners of Isla Vista is this: we don’t think that a community services district is necessary … because it wouldn’t address the problems that exist which we believe to be primarily behavioral,” Eckert said. “We believe that all the government institutions needed to address problems related to infrastructure and level of services already exist.”</p>\n<p>Eckert also said the appropriate action the legislature should take includes allowing LAFCO to approve or disapprove a CSD for I.V. after appropriate feasibility research has been done.</p>\n<p>“I think that the proper thing to be done … is to let Das Williams’ bill … set up the things that this commission cannot do,” Eckert said. “Let [the legislature] send the issue back down to [LAFCO] after, for your decision, after a neutral and thorough economic viability study to make a determination if a district is to be formed.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51559\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51559\" data-attachment-id=\"51559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/a-s-execs-give-reports-new-officers-sworn-in-2/senate_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369266755\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Abboud gets sworn in as the new  2013-2014 Associated Students President.

Community Organizer Jonathan Abboud however said that continued neglect of I.V. by county entities such as LAFCO cannot continue if I.V. wishes to attain a form of self-governance.</p>\n<p>“The old LAFCO has a really bad reputation and history for shafting Isla Vista in the Goleta cityhood attempt and our own cityhood attempts,” Abboud said. “It’s been 45 years and nothing’s happened. It’s getting worse and doing nothing is not an option and I think that those who think we should do nothing should then do something themselves.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also said a CSD in I.V. could potentially improve property values for the area and make it a “better place to live.”</p>\n<p>“The bill does not have to bypass LAFCO; it’s still an idea, that’s just one consideration people in the community came up with,” Abboud said. “Even if a CSD is limited [in scope] some sort of policy implementation could improve Isla Vista … it could improve it in a behavioral sense and structurally.”</p>\n<p>But I.V. property owner John Putra said establishing a CSD by act of legislature could undermine the legitimacy of LAFCO by allowing anyone to bypass it.</p>\n<p>“I find the process here is very dangerous from the standpoint of setting a precedent that, once it’s adopted, is going to eviscerate LAFCO because anybody can get around the process by introducing a bill and proceeding to change districts, form districts, without the input of LAFCO,” Putra said. “If this LAFCO does not take a strong stand against this kind of process I think it’s going wind up becoming a powerless agency.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year psychology and political science double major and Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk, the option of limiting LAFCO’s role in a self-governance bill for I.V. is more due to practical necessity rather than a dislike or distrust of the agency.</p>\n<p>“As far as precedent is concerned, we have already set some sort of insurmountable precedent just by the nature of being Isla Vista; our situation is so incredibly unique that it requires a unique solution,” Schunk said. “The term ‘bypass LAFCO’ is not necessarily accurate … it’s not necessarily a dislike or distrust of LAFCO; it’s simply the idea that LAFCO may not be able to, given the powers that it has, provide us with all of the things that we need.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59668\" style=\"width: 301px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59668\" data-attachment-id=\"59668\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/lafco-delays-discussion-opposing-bill-ab-3/das-williams/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Das-Williams_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1276&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1276\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"EVPLA Cameron Schunk discusses AB-3 with students.

CSD include a user’s utilities tax, where a tax is levied on use of utilities services such as water, electricity and gas, per household. According to Eckert, because most properties in I.V. are “master metered” for water utilities for entire complexes, rather than individual units, the cost of paying taxes on water falls on the property owner, rather than the renter, which is a concern to property owners of I.V. regarding their taxes.</p>\n<p>I.V. property owner Brian Bailey said he does not want to see taxes in I.V. increase further.</p>\n<p>“You’ve been bypassed, you’ve been neutered. What’s up with that?” Bailey said. “I took out our tax bill and looked at it and saw our park district bonds that have been in place for [many] years. They comprise, on this random one I pulled out, 11 percent of my tax bill. I really don’t want more shit on my tax bill.”</p>\n<p>But while Schunk said he could not say if there was “huge community consensus” on the user’s utility tax, in small I.V. town hall meetings he said most attendees agree it is a fairer method of taxation.</p>\n<p>“If we were to do a property tax, we would see only property owners receiving that tax … and logically passing it down to us through increased rent,” Schunk said. “That’s not to say a user utilities tax won’t increase rent per se, but in the sense that cost of living will still increase if you increase taxes. That’s a fact, there’s no getting around that unfortunately.”</p>\n<p>Eckert encouraged LAFCO to amend their letter to include language specifically opposing the bill unless it does not bypass LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>“The letter should be that this commission, you folks, opposes the bill unless it is limited to certain things and unless it leaves the issue of whether or not this district is to be formed up to you,” Eckert said.</p>\n<p>Williams said in a prior interview in December that the details of the services and other specifics on the form and function of an I.V. CSD have not been established because further input is needed from the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“We do not have all of the details because it is our intention of course to continue the community dialogue that has already been taking place,” Williams said. “We don’t want to rush and just decide what the shape is without continued community dialogue.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Where was LAFCO in 2003? Where was LAFCO when the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury published the report saying we should have a CSD? Where was LAFCO in our past three failed attempts and furthermore where was LAFCO during Goleta’s incorporation? – A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>LAFCO Commissioner Jeff Moorhouse said he thinks AB 3 raises questions about local government jurisdiction and that he opposes the bill entirely.</p>\n<p>“This issue is about, ‘Is it right for the state legislature to tell local people how to form a government?’” Moorehouse said. “AB 3 needs to be pulled. It needs to no longer exist and you need to go through the right process and let [LAFCO] help you.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said, while he respects Moorhouse’s position, he “respectfully disagrees” with it.</p>\n<p>“Part of what we saw at LAFCO is proof that perhaps Mr. Moorhouse needs to do more research into the exact nature of the legislative process for one, and perhaps also be more open-minded to … what we’ve been saying the whole time,” Schunk said. “We’ve never once said that we are doing this because we hate LAFCO and want them to have no part of this; that is not the issue here.”</p>\n<p>According to Moorhouse, who supports the letter in its present form, the university, the county and SBCC are partially responsible for perpetuating problems inherent to I.V.</p>\n<p>“I see the housing crisis, overcrowding, the planning, the parking, the lighting, the sidewalks — it’s all stuff that should have been done,” Moorhouse said.</p>\n<p>“Instead of coming here, ‘LAFCO come help us with a CSD’ you should be taking your time going in front of the county board of supervisors and tell them to start throwing some money your way to start fixing some of these problems because they do have the resources.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he disagrees with Moorhouse’s comments on LAFCO’s ability to adequately help I.V. given its history of shooting down prior self-governance proposals.</p>\n<p>“Where was LAFCO in 2003? Where was LAFCO when the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury published the report saying we should have a CSD?” Shunk said. “Where was LAFCO in our past three failed attempts and furthermore where was LAFCO during Goleta’s incorporation?”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the county has limited funding to provide to I.V. because of the realities of governing the rest of the county.</p>\n<p>“Doreen Farr and most of county administrators will agree that the county is doing [its] best and if they could wave their magic wand they would have more revenues and resources for the people of Isla Vista,” Williams said. “But because they represent a countywide government they can’t [allocate] revenue just for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59590\" style=\"width: 328px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59590\" data-attachment-id=\"59590\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/doreen-farr-coffee-collab/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Doreen-Farr-Office-Hourse_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=1184%2C788&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1184,788\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr spoke with students during her \\\"office hours\\\" at the Coffee Collaborative on Thursday afternoon.

Parks and Rec District (IVRPD) board member Paola De La Cruz, Moorhouse’s comments on getting the university more involved in governing I.V. already been tried without success.</p>\n<p>“We have seen that the university and entities in Isla Vista are not addressing these needs … there are other needs that need addressing and they aren’t doing that,” De La Cruz said. “So his response for us to go out to them and to ask for help. We have already done that … so we need to take a bigger step and do something that will actually address our needs.”</p>\n<p>Williams said AB 3 does not set such a precedent, nor does it seek to completely sideline LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>“There are many CSDs that have been established by the legislature,” Williams said. “This would not be the first; it is not a precedent … LAFCO has an important role in the formation of local government and I want to respect that as much as possible … at the very least [LAFCO] should inspect the financial feasibility report and have an oversight role in the financial feasibility of a CSD for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, details on what LAFCO’s oversight role on financial feasibility will be for an I.V. CSD has yet to be determined and that the time for action on a new government for I.V. must happen soon, as the consequences of inaction could result in damage to the community.</p>\n<p>“To me that the most important thing here is that there are people who will be hurt by our failure to take action,” Williams said. “LAFCO might wonder why we are moving so quickly. We are trying to get a strong amount of public input but we are moving quickly because inaction is causing problems in Isla Vista and I am not willing to wait another thirty years for people take action.”</p>\n<p><em>The next Santa Barbara LAFCO meeting will take place at the Santa Barbara County Administration building on 105 East Anapamu Street at 2 p.m. at the Board of Supervisor’s Hearing Room.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted LAFCO chair Doreen Farr stating the letter was “agonized” for discussion.

Clinic for the weekly shareholder’s meeting. Tuesday night’s meeting focused on the issue of amending CA AB-3 to include a specific governance plan for I.V. self-governance. <em>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista community members met Tuesday night for the weekly stakeholders meeting, held by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office, last night at the I.V. Clinic on 970 Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>Attendees strategized ways to get more input from residents regarding current and prior self-governance discussions and deliberated the May 15 deadline for an amended AB3 bill to include legal language addressing the need for self-governance in I.V. Currently AB3, introduced into the assembly by Williams, cannot be voted upon because it lacks explicit directions for the way I.V. will to be governed.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and longtime resident Pegeen Soutar said the approaching deadline to provide specific legal language in a month is unrealistic and “overwhelming.”</p>\n<p>“I am really uncomfortable trying to come up with something in one month,” Soutar said. “It is hard for us to get our heads around and I can’t even imagine the general public who have not been sitting in on these meetings. I don’t think we have all the facts yet. The idea of having something tangible by May is overwhelming to me.”</p>\n<p>Local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman said he was disappointed in the turnout at the town hall, due to both the low attendance number and lack of older community members.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised at how few people came. At previous town hall meetings a very large number of people have come,” Freeman said. “The previous town halls had a lot of older people, and at this meeting there were very few older people, it was almost all students. I was really surprised at the massive change.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, residents should be informed of the discussion topics before the meeting for future town halls.</p>\n<p>“It might have been really interesting to have had in the documentation that was sent out specifying what kind of things were going to be talked about, one of which being a community center,” Freeman said. “Because then people might have thought, ‘Oh, that’s a thing I care about.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60712\" style=\"width: 352px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60712\" data-attachment-id=\"60712\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/isla-vista-stakeholders-meeting-02102015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=4928%2C3264&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4928,3264\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting 02\\/10\\/2015.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423565074\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0666666666667\",\"title\":\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting 02\\/10\\/2015.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting Das Williams\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60712\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=342%2C226\" alt=\"Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus\" width=\"342\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60712\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I.V. community members listen at Tuesday night’s stakeholders meeting. <i>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Attendees at Tuesday’s meeting discussed how to better understand the needs of the community, particularly those of long-term renters and Latino families. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said Associated Students provides an I.V. Survey to gauge community opinions.</p>\n<p>“There’s an Associated Students in Isla Vista survey that deals directly with which services people would like to see,” Schunk said. “If we’re talking about biases and skewing results there is a large possibility that it is skewed because the survey is from the perspective of the student asking what services Associated Students can provide.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the EVPLA office is attempting to take into account the sentiments of Latino families and community members in addition to students in the self-governance process.</p>\n<p>“That survey obviously is limited in scope, but that outreach is largely from my office targeting Latino families and community members and so we’re trying to wrap that into this outreach,” Schunk said. “That’s a slow-going process, a lot of what we’re encountering is a lack of trust amongst community members in Associated Students, which has been around for a long, long time. We’re working to alleviate that.”</p>\n<p>Community organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said a professional firm will conduct a new fiscal study to better illuminate if and how I.V. could raise revenue to address community needs.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing a financial feasibility study by a professional firm,” Elliott said. “That’s going to give us a lot of the hard numbers, so these conversations are mostly educational and starting to get feedback and peoples’ general thoughts on it but obviously when we get those hard numbers that’s what’s going to mean the most.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said determining which services are needed in I.V. and how to pay for those services are an integral component of the self-government process.</p>\n<p>“That’s the critical thing in this whole process — finding out what services are lacking and how much is being spent at the level they’re at,” Gould said, “Where do we want that level to be and how much more is that going to take. Put a price tag on each one of those services, figure out what we want as a community and then pick and choose the services we’re going to spend our money on.”</p><div

Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents California’s 19th district including Santa Barbara, introduced Senate Bill 186 on Monday, which would authorize California community colleges to discipline students with suspension or expulsion for off-campus conduct.</p>\n<p>The bill would allow individual community colleges to develop criteria for when to exercise their new authority and would enable them to discipline students alongside the law enforcement for sexual assault, physical abuse, threats of violence, arson-related offenses, sexual harassment, stalking and hazing. SB 186 amends Section 76034 of the California Education Code, which currently states that on community college campuses, “No student shall be removed, suspended, or expelled unless the conduct for which the student is disciplined is related to college activity or college attendance.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said her bill is a response to concerns voiced by community college students and representatives, who she continuously consulted while writing SB 186.</p>\n<p>“In doing this bill, I was listening carefully to concerns that were expressed by, particularly, our own community colleges both in Santa Barbara and in the other parts of the district, which were very concerned about the limited scope of their ability to discipline,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>SBCC President Lori Gaskin said the bill would provide an important resource for the college to police its student body.</p>\n<p>“Senator Jackson and I have talked about areas that provide options for California community colleges to ensure the standards of student conduct are understood and honored,” Gaskin said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the bill would hold Isla Vista residents who attend SBCC to the same behavioral standards already enforced on UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We have students who live in Isla Vista who are given a pass for behavior that subjects our university students to some kind of disciplinary action,” Jackson said. “There’s really no excuse in my opinion for allowing a pass to someone for this kind of egregious behavior while other students are subject to discipline.”</p>\n<p>However, Gaskin also said while she is glad Jackson authored the bill, it is “bittersweet” that the legislation is necessary to maintain student discipline and that there are better ways to encourage good behavior.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like engaging my students in a negative way,” Gaskin said. “I like engaging them in a positive way — making them aware of our expectation that they’re scholars first and foremost and that they are pursuing this gift of higher education.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Robert Plastino said SB 186 would help law enforcement maintain safety in areas surrounding campuses by including community colleges in that process.</p>\n<p>“I believe that extended jurisdiction can have positive outcomes when it is used appropriately,” Plastino said. “I believe that the bill is a good start to empowering community colleges in their efforts to keep their students and neighboring communities safe.”</p>\n<p>Second-year SBCC undeclared major Daniela Hunt said she agrees with the general idea behind the bill, but expressed concerns about its potential for overreaches of authority.</p>\n<p>“If the student was in trouble for something drinking-related, it should not be the school’s concern and the student has a right to privacy,” Hunt said.</p>\n<p>Second-year SBCC engineering major Colin Andrews said he agrees with the idea of holding college students living in the same community to the same standard, even if they attend different schools.</p>\n<p>“I think the bill is good in that it will hold SBCC student[s] living in Isla Vista accountable to their school in the same way as their neighboring UCSB students,” Andrews said. “I just hope that authority would really only be used for serious crimes with victims.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said she recognizes the need for discipline but hopes students take the time to consider the consequences of their actions before the disciplinary process becomes necessary.</p>\n<p>“I like to ensure students recognize — from the get-go as freshman — that this is an important time of life,” Gaskin said. “There are reasonable expectations and standards of conduct that a reasonable person is expected to abide by in a college setting.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Students Debbie Fleming said it would be good for SBCC and UCSB students living in I.V. to have consistent rules.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista, where we have both UC and SBCC students living and socializing together, this new bill will help to create more consistent accountability and level the expectations and consequences for student residents,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>According to Fleming, the university strictly adheres to a code of conduct that is very similar to what SBCC would likely adopt similar policies if SB 186 is passed.</p>\n<p>“Our code of conduct allows us to exercise off-campus jurisdiction over physical abuse, sexual assault and sexual harassment, threats of violence or other conduct that threatens the health or safety of any persons,” Fleming said. “When serious and concerning behavior is brought to our attention, either by community members or law enforcement, we will investigate and pursue a conduct case that could be forwarded to the appropriate Conduct Committee for a hearing.”</p>\n<p>Jackson, who co-authored California’s recent “Yes Means Yes” bill with Senator Kevin de Leon, said this bill is part of her long-standing commitment to addressing sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“It identifies certain behaviors that are deemed to be egregious, and sexual assault is one of them,” Jackson said. “I have talked to some women’s groups who have also been supportive of the concept.”</p>\n<p>Hunt said she thinks SB 186 would increase accountability for perpetrators of sexual assault, creating a sense of security for students.</p>\n<p>“If the school is notified of those students it will definitely add a layer of protection because the community will feel safer knowing that the perpetrator is punished or under investigation,” Hunt said. “The school should investigate in that case and make sure that the student is guilty, and if so the school should be notified and take necessary actions.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Food Co-op board member Jeff Bessmer resigned after serving as IVPRD board member for over two years to pursue a job opportunity managing a co-op in Portland, Oregon.</p>\n<p>IVRPD director Alex Rodriguez has temporarily taken over the position as Chairperson and Director Pegeen Soutar moved to become vice-chairperson. Bessmer’s resignation has initiated a search for a permanent replacement, with the IVRPD currently collecting letters of interest to fill the vacancy.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the IVRPD board of directors will not be running a special election due to its high costs and arduous process.</p>\n<p>“We’ve never run a special election for a board member,” Soutar said. “They’re expensive and they’re complicated.”</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the selection process involves a given candidate sending in a letter of interest, speaking to the board at a meeting and answering any questions the board may have for the prospective candidate. Soutar said she is personally looking for a candidate that can balance the number of students and long-term residents on the board.</p>\n<p>“I like to have balance on the board,” Soutar said. “I think students have enthusiasm and great ideas, but I also think that long-term residents bring continuity.”</p>\n<p>Associate Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said he hopes to see the IVRPD board of directors increase their local involvement by sponsoring more events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see the [IVRPD] board sponsoring more community events like Meet Your Neighbor Day,” Schunk said. “[But] in the end it boils down to what there are resources for.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said the Board of Directors is accepting letters of interest from prospective candidates from now until Mar. 6, and the letter should include the candidate’s name, address, contact information and a brief statement regarding their intent to run.</p>\n<p>According to Gould, the IVRPD board is hand-selecting the new board member to complete Bessmer’s unfinished term as board member from now until Dec. 2016.</p>\n<p>“[The candidate] is appointed by the board and will finish out the outgoing board members term, which will be through December 2016,” Gould said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, February 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60821\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivrpd-seeking-new-chairperson/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60821\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivrpd-seeking-new-chairperson/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivrpd-seeking-new-chairperson/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivrpd-seeking-new-chairperson/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivrpd-seeking-new-chairperson/","id":4765,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4764,4763,4762],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
