Fischer said this policy affects a few streets in Santa Barbara, some in Goleta and every street in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students like Joy, it was a shock to learn they would not be able to park their oversized vehicles in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be disappointing if they started enforcing [the ordinance] in I.V. to kick out students and others who literally can’t afford rent, and live in a van by necessity,” Joy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the College Affordability Town Hall on Oct. 11 students asked Supervisor Joan Hartmann how the ordinance would affect students who live in their vehicles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those [aren’t] students but tend to be other homeless adults,” she replied, explaining that the situation in 2013 – before the passing of the ordinance – saw a number of oversized vehicles parked in I.V. that were not owned by students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the issue of housing insecurity is not limited to non-student adults </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2017, the UC Global Food Initiative found that 5% of UC undergraduate and graduate students experienced housing insecurity at some point in their enrollment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average rent for an apartment in I.V. is $2,131, according to Rentcafe.com, a rental site which compiles rental market trends. Some students choose to opt out of paying high rent prices by living in vehicles like vans, RVs or busses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katelyn Wiese, a third-year Santa Barbara City College geology student, moved into a school bus earlier this year. She had been living in I.V. for several months, but since these signs have gone up, she said she no longer feels comfortable parking her bus in the neighborhood and now parks in different locations around Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now I can’t be in I.V. It’s not even an option for me,” she told the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCSB Sustainability Coordinator Katie Maynard, the UC system has launched a Rapid Rehousing program to address housing insecure and houseless students; UCSB now receives $415,000 a year to assist housing-insecure and houseless students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Financial Crisis Response Team can place eligible students who are currently houseless or about to become houseless in bridge housing within 24 to 48 hours, after which the team will work with the student to help them find stable housing moving forward,” Maynard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the program can also provide “awards” to students to help if “they have difficulty paying rent and need financial support to stay in their current housing.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91253\" style=\"width: 318px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/when-your-home-becomes-a-parking-violation-large-vehicle-restrictions-affect-isla-vistans/img_0317/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-91253\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91253\" data-attachment-id=\"91253\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/when-your-home-becomes-a-parking-violation-large-vehicle-restrictions-affect-isla-vistans/img_0317/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0317\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-91253\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=308%2C410\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_0317.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Nadia Abushanab</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for some, the decision to move into a vehicle may not be motivated by finances. Both Wiese and Joy said that while their decisions to move into their vehicles were partially due to the financial benefit of not paying rent, they also said they wanted to experience more freedom, be able to travel more easily and learn to live more simply. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Santa Barbara municipal code, all oversized vehicles parked overnight are subject to a $50 minimum fine and possible removal. However, Alissa Hazard, a traffic engineer for the County of Santa Barbara, said that vehicles have previously only been cited when an I.V. resident files a complaint with the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Wiese’s school bus is oversized, she has not yet been cited or towed as of mid-October. She has, however, had multiple negative interactions with I.V. residents, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[A resident] yelled at me a couple of times … he [said], ‘If you’re not out of here by sunset, I’m calling the cops on you!’ … He said that us van-dwellers make the neighborhood a shithole,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She has also had conflicts with the IVFP. “They would wake me up at 3, 4 a.m., banging on my door, shining lights in the windows, yelling at me to get out,” she recounted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fischer emphasized that the ordinance only restricts oversized vehicles </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as Wiese’s school bus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but not regular-sized vehicles. She encourages those who are living in oversized vehicles to enroll in the Safe Parking Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cassie Roach, a UCSB alumnae now working for the Safe Parking Program in Santa Barbara, the program is meant to not only provide immediate overnight safety, but also to connect houseless folks to other community resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We partner a lot with the food bank … we also have our own food bank once a month; we try and get people connected to free showers, making sure people are signed up for food stamps, have health insurance [and] are signed up for different subsidized-housing waiting lists,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach estimates that around 10% of their clients are students.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wiese said that when she has been moved by police officers, they often referred her to the Safe Parking Program. However, she said the regulations of the program have stopped her from pursuing this option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not ideal for someone who has irregular schedules, who is either going to school or working. A lot of people who live in their vehicles are working and go to school. It’s not like they’re just sitting around all day,” Wiese said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roach emphasized that the regulations of the Safe Parking Program are not meant to make people’s lives more difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not meant to be this overbearing, strict program that’s going to have rules that they have to follow and just make life harder. It’s meant to be a supportive safe space for them, and we do want to work with all of our clients to see how we can best support them moving forward,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this to be a resource for students. We want to be supportive and helpful.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11:01 a.m.]: Joy uses they/them pronouns.

single season with 13 following a 4-1 at Cal State Bakersfield. Still, the season still has a ways to go as Santa Barbara will look to continue one of its best seasons in program history when it takes on UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Saying the Gauchos are in the midst of their best season ever is not much of an overstatement at this point considering they are off to their best start in school history with a 31-5 overall record. UCSB is also sitting atop the Big West standings with an 8-1 conference record following sweeps of UC Davis, UC Irvine and taking two of three at CSUF.</p>\n<p>In previous years, Santa Barbara going on the road would be enough to worry about the team faring well. In fact, before this year, UCSB was 76-91-1 in the Andrew Checketts era and the last two seasons in particular, the team was an abysmal 13-33.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This year, the Gauchos are 11-4 and if they win four of their final nine road matches that would be the most road wins in the Checketts era.</p>\n<p>This week, UCSB will take on a UCR team that is struggling. The Highlanders are currently 13-25 overall and sit at seventh in the conference with a 3-6 Big West mark. UCR is a much better 6-6 at home compared to a 7-19 record away from Riverside.</p>\n<p>Still, if UCR has any hopes of upsetting a hot UCSB team then it will need to focus on taking away its strong bats.</p>\n<p>Through its nine conference games, Santa Barbara is slashing .318/.372/.538. Specifically, the Gauchos .318 batting average and .538 slugging is first in the conference while its .372 on base percentage is second only behind Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Counting all games, not just conference, the Gauchos are the best team in the conference in nearly all statistics such as: batting average (.290), on-base percentage (.383), slugging percentage (.495), home runs (42), RBI’s (232), doubles (74), triples (22) and runs (258).</p>\n<p>Tommy Jew is one of the players directly responsible for this strong Gaucho offense. The junior center fielder currently sports a strong .296 batting average and in the last four games, he has gone 7-15 at the plate with two RBI’s and one home run. His 30 RBI’s are tied for the second-most on the team.</p>\n<p>Jew leads the team in homers with nine on the season and he has also been a terror on the base paths with 16 stolen bases, tied for the team best mark with fellow outfielder Tevin Mitchell.</p>\n<p>Jew has also been stellar defensively with a perfect fielding percentage and he has also made some great catches including one that stole a home run.</p>\n<p>Another very hot bat is senior designated hitter/catcher Thomas Rowan who comes into the series opener working a seven-game hit streak. In fact, Rowan has successfully earned a hit in all but six games this season.</p>\n<p>In the month of April, which UCSB has played in 12 games, Rowan is 18-43 (.418) with 12 RBI’s, four home runs, two extra-base hits and striking out just six times in 43 at bats. The senior has also had 14 multiple hit games this season in his 36 appearances.</p>\n<p>On the mound, the Gauchos do not get much easier. Michael McGreevy has quickly transformed himself into the first guy out of the bullpen for the Gauchos as the freshman sports a Big West best 1.62 ERA.</p>\n<p>Left-handed Saturday starting pitcher Jack Dashwood has also been hot as of late and was named Big West Pitcher of the Week this past Tuesday following a dominant performance against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>The sophomore tossed a three-hit, complete game shutout and was actually working a perfect game through seven innings before allowing back-to-back singles.</p>\n<p>Finally, ace closer Chris Lincoln, whose 10 saves are a league best, was recently named to the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association Stopper of the Year Midseason Watch List. The junior righty currently holds a 4.18 ERA and has struck out 25 batters in just 23.1 innings of work.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB does need to watch out for the Highlanders streak hitter, Connor Cannon. The junior right-handed pitcher/first baseman has been on an absolute tear the past two weeks winning back-to-back Big West Field Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>Last week, Cannon had a slash line of .588/.650/1.235 as he hit three home runs and knocked in 11 runs. He broke UCR’s program record for most RBI’s in a game with eight against New Mexico on April 19.</p>\n<p>Overall, this week is just another week for UCSB to inch closer to something it hasn’t laid claim to in more than 30 years, a Big West title. There is no time for complacency in conference play. 13 straight wins is great, but nothing compared to the other ambitions this team has.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on UC Riverside for game one of the series at 6 p.m. on Friday, April 26 at the Riverside Sports Complex.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Santa Barbara traveled to UC Riverside with a bunch of momentum, riding the high of a program-best 13 straight wins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What met them, however, was a swift punch in the face as the Gauchos stumbled losing their first conference series of the season, dropping two of three against the Highlanders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of that, UCSB dropped to second in the Big West standings with a 9-2 conference mark. Following a win at home versus CSUB on Tuesday, Santa Barbara is 33-7 overall. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, the Gauchos will have a similar test as they travel to face CSUN, a team that has had its fair share of struggles this year currently boasting a 19-23 overall mark and a 6-9  league record placing them in the bottom third of the standings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, really everything that could go wrong, did go wrong for UCSB. In losses on Friday and Saturday, the Gauchos were outscored by a combined score of 16-6. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, starter Ben Brecht took his usual spot on the mound for the Gauchos. Coming into the game, Brecht had pitched stellar, but that night he was anything but.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brecht (7-1) suffered his first loss of the season following an outing that included allowing eight hits and seven earned runs in just four innings of work. The junior also had a season-low three strikeouts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, the story was the same for Jack Dashwood (6-1). The lefty suffered his first loss of the season following a 4.2 inning outing that involved him allowing nine hits and five earned runs. Dashwood did strike out nine batters but gave up a season-high two home runs in the same game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will hope to get back on track this week facing a CSUN team that ranks seventh in the conference in batting average. The team sports just a .259 batting average. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when CSUN does get contact, it hits for power as its slugging percentage (.404) ranks third in the conference meaning Gaucho pitchers will need to make sure to not throw stuff right down the plate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, last week UCSB pitchers were facing one of the best power hitters in the Big West in Conner Cannon from UCR. This week, CSUN does not really have a ferocious hitter such as Cannon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Matadors do have infielder Kyle Barret, however, and he certainly has had a solid campaign. He currently sports a .333 batting average and has drove in 25 runs. His 15 doubles on the season rank first in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN still has other solid hitters across the lineup as it has four players in the top 30 of the conference in terms of batting average, but no one that really scares the opposition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos, however, definitely have those power hitters that scare the opposition. Even last week, UCSB still sprayed a bunch of hits, and in the one game the squad took at UCR, it exploded for 20 hits and 15 runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore shortstop McClain O’Connor was the man of the hour last Sunday at UCR as he had the game of his life batting 4 for 6 driving in four runs and scoring three times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O’Connor is really one of the hottest bats on the team since becoming a consistent player in the lineup mid-March. In his last 14 outings, O’Connor has accumulated 20 hits and eight RBI’s. His .359 batting average would rank as one of the top among the conference if he had more at-bats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of hot bats, outfielder Armani Smith has been on a tear. The junior currently holds a five-game hitting streak and in that same time span, Smith has gone 6-17 with three RBI’s. His 33 RBI’s rank third amongst the team while his eight home runs rank second.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, Smith also hit the .300 club as he sports a .302 batting average thanks to his recent hitting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, Marcos Castanon made his return to the lineup last weekend and has been solid. The sophomore third baseman in his three starts has gone an outstanding 7-13 with three runs scored and one batted in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For UCSB, this week is all about getting back on track. A nice midweek win really gave this team a little more confidence, but the truth is the Gauchos are far from a league crown. Cal Poly is coming hard so Santa Barbara needs to pick up these wins when it can.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will begin its three-game set versus CSUN at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 3 at the Matador Baseball Field.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Two more men would reach base and Brendan Brooks would strike again, hitting his second single of the game scoring one from second base.</p>\n<p>Senior Ryan Fitzpatrick would come to the plate and add two more RBIs to his already team-leading total on the season with his own bases-clearing triple.</p>\n<p>Nick Anderson would hit a sacrifice fly that would bring Fitzpatrick home and Ledesma would be pulled from the game a batter later. Ledesma’s outing on the mound was done over 4.2 innings pitched, seven hits, four earned runs and five strikeouts.</p>\n<p>By the end of the fifth, the Anteaters were comfortably ahead thanks to their six run explosion midway through the game increasing their lead to 7-0.</p>\n<p>The Eaters’ starter for the game was freshman Trenton Denholm who was cruising throughout the entire game, keeping the Gauchos hitless and scoreless after six innings of work. Denholm was able to comfortably work his way through the lineup solidly in control, striking out batters when he wasn’t getting the Gauchos to hit into his waiting defense.</p>\n<p>UCSB junior Sam Cohen would break Denholm’s hitless streak with a single to right field, putting men on first and second after sophomore Eric Yang reached first getting hit by a pitch. ‘</p>\n<p>The sophomore would cross the plate on a Denholm wild pitch which would be the only run the Gauchos could muster in the match, unable to match the nine-run effort given a game previously.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters would win the game 11-1, after tacking on two more runs in the sixth and eighth innings. Brendan Brooks finished the game leading everyone in RBIs with four and tying with senior Parker Coss in Anteaters hits with three.</p>\n<p>The entire home team showed up at the plate and UCI was able to enjoy their second victory scoring ten runs or more in the series. The stellar pitching from Denholm only made the win that much more sweeter for Head Coach Mike Gillespie who couldn’t have asked for a better Sunday game of baseball from his team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to regroup in Los Angeles as they continue on with their seven game road trip and hope to escape with a positive record, despite starting out 1-2.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play the University of Southern California Trojans on Tuesday, April 16 at 6 PM PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/","id":4111,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4110,4109,4108],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
