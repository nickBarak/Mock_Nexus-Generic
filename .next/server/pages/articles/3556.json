Apparently pointing to your crotch and doing “the potty dance” is universal for “Where are the restrooms?” Once, my friend Danielle tried to tell our adviser that she had a sinus infection and accidentally said she had a breast infection. Only when she pointed to the center of her face did he understand what she meant.</p>\n<p>While I struggle to learn Spanish there are, however, two words here I understand clearly: siesta and fiesta. From 2 to 5 p.m. everyday, most stores close for naptime. If I walk the streets between these hours, it feels as though a nuclear war might begin and I am the only one not hiding in an underground shelter. I haven’t slept through the middle of the day since kindergarten, so at first, a three-hour nap did not feel natural. Coming from a capitalist country where most stores are open until around 9 p.m. doesn’t help either. But, when you party until sunrise five days a week, I think the siesta is essential for survival. Did I mention that the sun does not come up until after 8 a.m.?</p>\n<p>I stood outside the window of a restaurant during siesta once and I felt like that woman from that Mervyns commercial as I opened and closed my hands repeating, “open, open, open.” Not even a hungry-looking face pities them into prying the doors open early. As they say here, “No me hagas una cara de cordero degollado,” which means don’t pout at me, but literally translated means, “Don’t make the face of a decapitated lamb.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sadness and siesta aside, the Spanish fiesta more than atones for the times I have gone hungry during the middle of the day. Without a doubt, Alcalá de Henares – my study center city just outside of Madrid – knows everything about merrymaking. One minute giant puppets parade the streets, the next a Renaissance Fair arrives to sell handcrafted swords, grilled ribs, and herbs to cure flatulence and impotency. We actually had a day off school to celebrate Miguel de Cervantes, the famed writer of Don Quixote.</p>\n<p>Additionally, only in Spain can you ditch your Education Abroad Program orientation discipline lecture to attend the largest food fight in the world – La Tomatina. Playing with food is a common childhood activity for most, a sexual fantasy for some and an annual extravaganza for the entire population of Buñol, a small town outside of Valencia. Every year approximately 20,000 people crowd into the narrow cobblestone streets of this city to launch 8 tons of tomatoes at each other for exactly one hour. Longing desperately to relive childhood memories of mixing ketchup and other condiments at the dinner table, I chose to embark on this adventure a couple of months ago, but not without last minute preparation, of course.</p>\n<p>Since the bus to Buñol didn’t leave until 5 a.m. we had no choice but to head directly to Madrid and dance until our estimated time of departure. Unfortunately, the two guys that accompanied my girl friends and me exhausted their money on alcohol. When the bus came, we could hardly scrape together sufficient funds for transportation. As such, we had a mere 5 euros to spend on food for the day. At the gas station, we bought two pieces of white bread each and one bottle of water. Hungry once again, I hoped my starvation might prompt the necessary hostility to vigorously launch tomatoes, or tom-ah-toes as some say.</p>\n<p>Either way, it is difficult to speak when you stand atop a white van and a solid green tomato flies 20 miles per hour at your face. Yes, the impact does hurt, especially since I did not carry ammo. I did not bring a shield, and the only defense I had against the other tomato throwers was quick wit and my uncanny ability to curl up and fit into small spaces. I may have done more fleeing than fighting that day, but I came out of that tomato war alive, though smelly, and ready to take advantage of the many other Spanish cultural activities.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

As the years have gone by and the county population has grown, the number of jail cells has remained almost constant, he said. Throughout his campaign, and during his first 100 days in office, Brown has placed the blame squarely on outdated infrastructure.</p>\n<p>“The crux of the problem is that our jail infrastructure was built in the 1970s, and has had minimal additions,” Brown said.  “Our infrastructure has been outpaced by our population growth.”</p>\n<p>Along with overcrowding, the aging facilities have created a slew of other problems for the county, Brown said. Most drastically, the Sheriff’s Dept. has been forced to shorten non-violent criminals’ stays in the county jail, just to ensure that more inmates can fit in.</p>\n<p>“We have had to adjust our criteria for who we incarcerate and how long they stay. People that should be in jail aren’t,” Brown said. “When this starts happening, you start to lose the integrity of the entire criminal justice system.”</p>\n<p>Due to a cap on the numbers of prisoners allowed in each facility and a California Superior Court ruling, the county only has one other option besides releasing non-violent prisoners early – incarcerate fewer people.</p>\n<p>The county has sentenced law-breakers to other punitive programs, but the net effect is, as 3rd District Supervisor Brooks Firestone put it, that there are people on the streets that were sentenced to not be on the streets.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor Nikki Jones, who has a Ph.D. in criminology and teaches at UCSB, sees the situation in a different light. Since jails across the state are overflowing, and the crime rate has dropped, the problem, Jones said, does not lie in the size of county jails but instead in the criminal justice system itself.</p>\n<p>“Over the last decade or so, the crime rate has dropped off significantly from record highs in the early ’90s and late ’90s,” she said. “This introduces a serious contradiction: Why is it that our incarcerated population continues to grow even though crime isn’t increasing?”</p>\n<p>“Tough on crime” policies and mandatory sentences like the Three Strikes rule have more than made up for the drop in criminal activity, Jones said.</p>\n<p>“These policy changes increase the number of men and women who are incarcerated in our nation’s jails and prisons and puts pressure on local institutions, like county jails, that do not have the infrastructure to warehouse – as many of our facilities now do – the large numbers of people who enter its doors,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the cause, Firestone said the problem has gotten so bad that there are 10 to 20 more convicts than there are beds every night in the county jail, forcing prisoners to spend the night on the ground.</p>\n<p><b>Possible Solutions</b></p>\n<p>In lieu of overhauling the entire criminal justice system, the most obvious solution for officials has been to build a new prison. The idea has been raised many times and in increasing fervor as the overcrowding has become more severe.</p>\n<p>The most popular plan of the moment calls for the new jail to be built in the northern portion of the county, near Santa Maria. Sheriff Brown, whose campaign pushed the jail issue hard, said the proposed North County jail could house 800 inmates, and decisively solve the overcrowding problem.</p>\n<p>But, naturally, it would not be cheap.</p>\n<p>The daunting $153 million price tag – which would also include an estimated annual operation cost of anywhere from $19 to 30 million – has kept the facility from becoming a reality.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors, which is ultimately in charge of the funding, feels that the bill is too steep, and Firestone said the public agrees. According to the supervisor, a poll was given to the public asking whether they would be in favor of an increase in the sales tax to fund the proposed prison – the poll came back a resounding “no.”</p>\n<p><b>State-Funded Jail</b></p>\n<p>However, recent state legislation has given Brown another shot at fulfilling his campaign promises. Under a deal reached last month between the governor and state legislators, $7.4 billion of state funds will go into prison and rehabilitation programs, and $1.2 billion of that has been earmarked for local jail beds – the largest sum of money ever allocated by the state for jails.</p>\n<p>Due to the severity of area’s problem and the amount of work the county has already put into trying to solve it, Santa Barbara is well positioned to receive some of those funds, Brown said.</p>\n<p>The proposed state-funded facility would have 800 beds and the county would only have to pay for three-eighths of the construction and a portion of the operational costs.</p>\n<p>But, as Firestone and Brown have both said, “The devil is in the details.” The catch is that of the 800 total beds, 500 would be reserved for state prisoners, as opposed to county prisoners. The legislature also requires that the facility would have a re-entry station, aimed at better preparing convicts for their re-entry into society.</p>\n<p>The opposition has argued that the state funding comes with too many strings attached, but Brown argues the prison would still be a great benefit.</p>\n<p>“Sure there could be some additional costs, but we would benefit from an economy of scale. We are getting a long-term solution for a much smaller cost,” Brown said. “It is a great benefit to us to accept a joint facility with the state.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, with the current recidivism rate – the percentage of released prisoners that return to committing crimes and are caught – at 70 percent, Brown and state legislators have applauded the required re-entry stations.</p>\n<p>The high recidivism rate is a particular problem for Jones, who said that educational programs inside prisons would help reduce the number of readmissions.</p>\n<p>“Since 95 percent of people who enter jails and prison eventually are released, and our jails and prisons – especially in California – offer little educational or treatment programs for people who are incarcerated, we have set a large number of men and women up for failure once they are released from these facilities,” she said.</p>\n<p><b>For Now</b></p>\n<p>To help persuade the public to accept the deal, Brown has created a “blue-ribbon” panel of experts from various disciplines to look into the proposed solutions. He said he hopes that the public will see the multi-disciplined group and know that the sheriff is not just asking the county for unnecessary funds, but that the proposal is well researched and well founded. He believes that this approach is much more marketable to the public.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, at least until the North County jail issue is solved, Brown is looking for short-term solutions.</p>\n<p>One of his originally proposed options is already off the table. On the campaign trail, Brown proposed shipping inmates over to a vacant jail facility in Tulare County, which was empty due to a lack of funding in the county. Since then, the county has procured funds, and all beds in the jail are accounted for.</p>\n<p>Now, the sheriff’s short-term solutions include an agreement with the Lompoc City Jail to house county inmates; efforts to use more home incarcerations; a remodeling of older facilities; and a change of the Lompoc County holding facility from a Type I facility to a Type II facility. The change would allow the facility to hold prisoners for longer than the current 96-hour limit, he said.</p>\n<p>But no matter what the county builds, Jones said the underlying societal problems will remain.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, this is not a problem that we can build our way out of,” she said.</p>\n<p>Until jails offer college courses, General Education Development programs, mental health and addiction treatments, the problem will never truly be solved, Jones said.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately,” she said, “the real solution to this problem must come from outside the criminal justice system.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14072\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14072\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-08/sheriff-brown-wants-crowded-inmates-off-floor-in-jail-beds/","id":3554,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3553,3552,3551],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Methamphetamine Ravages SB County","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Methamphetamine has cooked in Santa Barbara County drug laboratories for decades, yet its current prevalence trumps even the days when Andy Warhol's cohort Edie Sedgwick made her meth-fueled romps thr...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Methamphetamine has cooked in Santa Barbara County drug laboratories for decades, yet its current prevalence trumps even the days when Andy Warhol’s cohort Edie Sedgwick made her meth-fueled romps through Isla Vista’s streets.</p>\n<p>It is the drug of choice in the county, and accounts for a significant portion of its crime, particularly in North County. Its popularity maintains a stronghold in I.V. and at UCSB, and it can still be found in the homes of 40-year-old dealers on Abrego Road or in the dorms of 18-year-old freshmen on campus.</p>\n<p>Oft ignored and rarely talked about outside of the C.A.S.E. classroom, the drug has infiltrated the area. In 2005, for instance, 78 percent of drug-related bookings to juvenile hall were for meth, while more than half of Santa Maria’s Drug Court participants who tested positive for drugs were found to have meth in their system.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Beyond the personal problems related to health and general well-being, meth causes a headache for the county both for its financial and social costs. Officials hope to cut the problem off at the knees, but are finding the eradication – or mere stemming of it – increasingly complex.</p>\n<p><b>Antifreeze, Drain Cleaner and Kitty Litter</b></p>\n<p>Created by the Japanese a century ago, and used by Kamikazes before they made their last flights, meth was recently named California’s “drug of choice” by a report from the county’s Methamphetamine Prevention Network Summit. But you don’t have to tell Santa Barbara County officials that; community leaders have been decrying meth’s prevalence for years.</p>\n<p>Meth is a stimulant that activates the central nervous system and drastically increases the amount of dopamine – a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, enjoyment, and positive reinforcement – in the brain. And thanks to that jolt of euphoric dopamine, meth is more addictive than many other drugs.</p>\n<p>“The sensation of anything by comparison – pleasurable sex or easy money – is dwarfed by the amount of dopamine meth releases into the brain,” said John Doyel, the treatment coordinator for Santa Barbara Alcohol, Drug &amp; Mental Health Services. “It is more addicting than alcohol or marijuana.”</p>\n<p>Crystal meth appeals to all sorts of people, from the weight-conscious woman who uses the drug to curb her appetite to the student who uses it as a study aid to the curious preteen, Doyel said.</p>\n<p>“It is a culturally synchronic pandemic that fits in beautifully with American society, as it appeals to things we value, like optimism,” Doyel said.</p>\n<p>What’s more, anyone can brew methamphetamines with a mixture of household items, including detergents, cold medicines and kitty litter. And addicts can get high almost any way they please: Meth can be injected, inhaled, or ingested. Of course, purchasing it isn’t that difficult either: a few doses run for about $20.</p>\n<p>In the short term, meth can induce irritability, insomnia, confusion, tremors, convulsions, cardiovascular collapse or even death. Meth users also often develop “meth mouth,” in which their teeth rot out of their head as a result of the drug and the user’s poor dental habits and the consumption of sugary drinks, which users crave on binges. Even if a user quits the habit, he or she is still subject to a slew of long-term effects, including vitamin and mineral deficiencies, lowered resistance to disease and organ damage to the lungs, liver and kidneys.</p>\n<p>But then, the user isn’t the only one who suffers. Families in Santa Barbara have been torn apart over the drug; about half of the 300 child out-of-home placements as of July 1, 2006 were done so as a result of abuse or neglect resulting from a parent’s meth use.</p>\n<p>Some I.V. residents have noticed the influx of the drug into their beachside town. In a report given to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors, former UCSB student Shanna McGuiness said she had seen the drug – and its effects – in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I have recently heard that meth has been circulating in I.V., and I am hoping that it does not become the new trend, because I have seen the effects it can have on families,” she said. “It’s disturbing to know that this is the drug people in California are using, because it has the potential to be more harmful than other things.”</p>\n<p><b>Meth and U(niversities)</b></p>\n<p>Because of meth’s widespread appeal – and the “Superman” feeling associated with it – meth addiction has spread like a weed in California, which the National Institute on Drug Abuse said has one of the highest rates of meth usage.</p>\n<p>Colleges are a hotbed for meth usage, Doyel said.</p>\n<p>“This is a drug that has always been a problem in California; they used to deal it everywhere up at Stanford because kids used it to study harder,” he said. “There is still an old speed limit sign posted up on frat row that says ‘Speed, $5 a hit.'”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program assistant director Al Rodriguez described the typical meth user in the Santa Barbara area as “a young adult, typically male, unemployed and from North County,” the issue hit close to home last year when university officials discovered a meth lab inside a residence hall room, after the two occupants had been kicked out of the university due to low GPAs.</p>\n<p>A former neighbor of the dorm room meth producers, who wishes to remain anonymous, said although he knew his neighbors dealt drugs from time to time, he had no idea that people in the building were involved in the production of crystal meth.</p>\n<p>“I knew they experimented with a lot of stuff, but didn’t know about the lab until they got kicked out of school,” he said. “Every new drug was a new story. I was never home at the same time as them, so I didn’t know them very well, but they told me they had used meth once or twice and said it was kind of crazy…</p>\n<p>“I knew a lot of people who used meth last year but never thought it was a problem,” he said. From observing his neighbors’ use, he said he could tell the drug “is really addictive and makes people really awake and really hyper.”</p>\n<p>The student said it was somewhat frightening that no one would have known about the existence of the on-campus lab if the pair had not been kicked out.</p>\n<p>Other students reacted similarly upon hearing about last year’s incident.</p>\n<p>“It really scares me that something like this could have happened on this campus , because I had no idea that a crystal meth lab could have been next door to me,” said Sandra Stokes, a second year linguistics major. “I had no idea that meth was a problem in this area, let alone on our campus.”</p>\n<p><b>A Santa Maria Export?</b></p>\n<p>But outside Isla Vista and UCSB’s domain, the problem is not nearly as hidden. According to 4th District Supervisor Joni Gray, crystal meth has created a “crisis” and is a “burden for the county because of the way it destroys peoples’ lives.”</p>\n<p>In certain parts of Santa Barbara County – particularly North County and the Santa Maria area – Gray said meth helps contribute to high levels of violent behavior and abuse, in addition to the overcrowding of county jails.</p>\n<p>According to a January 2007 county report, meth use has mushroomed in a relatively short span of time; in 2001, 19 percent of patients in county drug treatment programs claimed meth as their primary drug, but in 2006 this increased to 31 percent, making it the drug of choice in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Currently, about 55 percent of Drug Court participants in Santa Maria who tested positive for drug use were found to be on meth; in Lompoc – a possible location for a new detox program site – the statistic is 42 percent, while in Santa Barbara it is 33 percent.</p>\n<p>“It destroys families because parents lose their sense of right or wrong,” Gray said.</p>\n<p>Gray recalled an incident involving two parents who accidentally killed their child while under the influence of crystal meth.</p>\n<p>“They literally rolled over [in bed] and suffocated their own child while sleeping,” Gray said.</p>\n<p>Apparently the tragedy is not entirely unheard of. Last March, Lompoc resident Jason Gomez rolled over on his infant twins and suffocated them to death while under the influence of methamphetamines.</p>\n<p>Kelly Rodriguez, a recovered meth abuser, told the Methamphetamine Prevention Network Summit that the drug practically ruined her life: She lost her children, went to jail and became homeless.</p>\n<p>“Using meth was the most self-destructive thing I’ve ever done,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>Biting Back at “Meth Mouth”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors is currently looking for a solution to the meth “epidemic.” The Methamphetamine Prevention Network Summit’s report painted a dour picture of the current resources.</p>\n<p>“Services were being strained and circumstances such as county jail over-crowding, waiting lists for detoxification and overwhelming caseload for child welfare services were attributed to meth abuse,” the report states.</p>\n<p>One possible new approach, highlighted in the report to the board, is a project called “From ‘Me’ to ‘We.'”</p>\n<p>“It’s a new benchmark for bringing together a broad-based coalition of public and private agencies, organizations and other stakeholders to fight the impact of methamphetamine,” Gray said of the program.</p>\n<p>The “broad-based coalition” aims to bolster its ranks with forums held throughout the spring to get the public support and to create more strategies for combating the problem.</p>\n<p>Others note the answer isn’t an easy one. Regardless, Rodriguez of the UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program said the meth problem in the county needs to be proactively addressed.</p>\n<p>“Our collective approach to our meth problem needs rethinking,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14150\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14150\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-05-15/methamphetamine-ravages-sb-county/","id":3555,"author":{"id":348,"name":"Casey Ibbetson"},"related":[3554,3553,3552],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
