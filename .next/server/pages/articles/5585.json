A real character building road trip,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “Our confidence is getting good again, and we are ready to get some nice wins at home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their first opponent, Lewis, holds a 5-2 record but has not defeated any team that is currently ranked, and their two losses have come against No. 3 UC Irvine and No. 6 Pepperdine. Loyola-Chicago has a 5-1 overall record and, despite a loss to UCI, the Ramblers upset Pepperdine back on Jan. 18 in a five-set thriller.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all teams having five wins, Santa Barbara’s road to that success has been a lot tougher considering that their last five matches have come against ranked opponents and they own the toughest schedule in the nation with their remaining opponents boasting a combined win percentage of .717. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, even though 5-3 is a good record, the Gauchos know they could be in a better position and have to play well in their upcoming games if they want to overcome their gruesome schedule. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have the top schedule in the country and its because we want to be playing tough teams and get better to be ready when the playoffs come,” McLaughlin said. “We could easily be 6-2, if not 7-1, but that’s the way it goes. Sometimes it is better to lose so we can work a bit harder.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is 5-5 all-time against Lewis and has lost three straight meetings to the Flyers, including a 3-1 defeat in Illinois last season. If the Gauchos want to change their fortunes this time around, then they will need to find a way to break through a tough Flyer defense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lewis holds the 12th best opponent hitting percentage in the nation holding them to a .200 clip. The Flyers also average nearly 10 digs per set, fifth-best mark in the country, and three blocks per set, second-best mark in the country. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means UCSB will need to have an efficient, aggressive offensive showing and also need a big game from some of its offensive leaders such as senior outside hitter, Corey Chavers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chavers leads the team in kills per set averaging 3.29 and has amassed 102 total kills thus far in the year. No other Gaucho has more than 50, meaning that the team has a nice balance with Chavers leading the charge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow teammate junior Keenan Sanders had a career day against Lewis last season finishing with a career-high 24 kills in that match. A repeat performance of that could put the Gauchos over the top. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offensively, Lewis is very team-oriented, with five players averaging two kills per set and no player having more than 66 kills in total.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are 2-1 all-time against Loyola-Chicago, losing for the first time last season, 3-1. Offensively, UCSB will need a similar game plan considering the Ramblers hold their opponents hitting percentage to just .174, ranking sixth in the nation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season when these two teams met, Chavers led the team with 18 kills, but the next closest Gaucho only had nine apiece. More even distribution will be a big key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes Loyola-Chicago even tougher, however, is that its offense is even better than its defense. As a team, the Ramblers average 13.86 kills per set, .363 hitting percentage and 12.68 assists per set. Those averages are the No. 2, No. 3 and No. 5 ranks in the country, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior outside hitter Collin Mahan is one of the biggest forces in the Rambler offense. The New York native recently was honored with the MIVA Offensive Player of the Week award thanks to a 28 kill performance in his team’s last two outings, including the upset win against Pepperdine where Mahan registered 18 kills on an efficient .309 hitting. This comes as no surprise as Mahan was also picked as the Preseason MIVA Player of the Year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defensively, UCSB will need to rely on Senior libero Hayden Boehle who leads the team with 78 digs while Sanders leads the team with 25 blocks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, this weekend will be important for Santa Barbara to make some noise on a national level in the shadows of the bigger Big West teams. Currently, the top three spots in national rankings belong to Big West teams. If UCSB wants to be there, they will need to prove it with some big wins at home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is always good to be at Rob Gym and I love playing teams ranked above us. They give us the challenge we need to get better and our guys will be ready,” McLaughlin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes on Lewis at 7 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 25 at Robertson Gym. The match against Loyola-Chicago will be on Saturday, Jan. 26 at the same time and location.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

On Sunday, the Gauchos were informed that they captured a spot in the National Invitational Volleyball Championship (NIVC),  a tournament that boasts of 32 competing teams.</p>\n<p>“It was great to be invited; it just means all of our hard work had paid off. Now we are striving for more and continuing to get better as a program,” junior outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara clinched a tournament berth following a successful regular season that saw them finish with a 17-11 overall record and a 9-7 record in Big West play. UCSB’s 9-7 league record, which helped them earn a fourth-place finish, is also its best finish since 2013. In the first round, the Gauchos will face off against Fresno State, who comes into the tournament boasting a 21-10 overall mark and who also finished second in the Mountain West following a 13-5 league record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If UCSB hopes to continue its season beyond its first-round match, which will be played on Thursday, then it will need to rely on its star outside hitter, Ruddins. The junior is one of the best players in the entire country let alone the conference. She averages 5.37 kills per set, which is the best mark of any Big West player, and also averaged 0.38 service aces per set, the third best mark in league play. Additionally, Ruddins was one of two Gauchos named First Team All-Big West.</p>\n<p>“I am confident in my own skill set, and the rest of the team has been working just as hard,” Ruddins said. “I think we will be ready for this moment come Thursday.”</p>\n<p>The other first team letter winner is senior defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi. Petrachi was the league’s best in digs per set, averaging 5.02. Another key contributor for UCSB this season was freshman setter Olivia Lovenberg, who did a great job of positioning teammates all year, leading to her Big West best mark of 11.19  assists per set. While big for UCSB, this match is also just as big for Fresno State, who will be seeking its first postseason win since 1995.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, the last time Fresno State was in the postseason was in 2002, when it also faced off against Santa Barbara. That match did not go so well for the Bulldogs, who lost 3-1. This time around, if Fresno State wants a win, then it will need to make sure to stop Ruddins. One player capable of doing that is sophomore Reagan Leonard, whose 570 digs this year is the second most in a season in program history. Her current 4.75 digs-per-set average is second best in the Mountain West.</p>\n<p>On offense, senior Taylor Slover led the team and ranked third in her conference with 3.94 kills per set. History definitely favors the Gauchos in this matchup as they have won 25 of the 33 total meetings, but Thursday will be a different match.</p>\n<p>If UCSB could knock off Fresno State on Thursday, then it will face off against the winner of UNLV/UC Irvine. Santa Barbara did not play UNLV this season but lost its two matches against conference foe UCI this year.</p>\n<p>Overall, this season has been a success for UCSB. It has improved drastically from last season, when it only won eight games, and overall it has played great team volleyball. It is an accomplishment just being at the NIVC tournament, but the Gauchos will be hoping for more.</p>\n<p>“It’s great that we have more volleyball, and we are all happy to be here in a position we have never been, but now we have to go out there and play well,” Ruddins said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on Fresno State at 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 29, at the Cox Pavilion Center. With a win, Santa Barbara will advance to the second round, during which it will play either UNLV or UCI at 7 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 30, at the same location.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 07 of the Nov. 29 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

than UCSB are No. 1 Hawai‘i and No. 2 Long Beach State, both of whom are undefeated in regular season and conference play. UC Irvine follows closely as well, coming in at the fourth seed with a 3-5 conference record.</p>\n<p>On the season, the Gauchos boast a 17-7 overall record, just above a win percentage of .700. Considering the first of this week’s pair of matches will be away at UC Irvine, a win for the Gauchos will have UCSB’s away record all level at 5-5 on the season. Meanwhile, the Gauchos have turned the Robertson Gymnasium into a bit of a fortress, with UCSB’s home record currently standing at 11-2 on the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to return to their winning ways, as they’ll be coming off a most recent pair of losses to No. 1 Hawai’i, away at the big island. In their two games, UCSB only managed to snag a single set in their favor, but it was enough to snap the Rainbow Warriors’ win streak of 74 sets in a row.</p>\n<p>As for UC Irvine, the Anteaters find themselves at a 15-10 overall for the season, meaning they have a win percentage of .600. Plenty will be at stake for both sides here, as the Anteaters are only a win behind in the conference standings, so an unfavorable reseeding is possible if the Gauchos accidentally falter.</p>\n<p>Historically, UCSB is favored considering the all-time series between the two sides. With a 46-30 head-to-head record, the Gauchos will want to further add to it. However, UCSB split last year’s pair of matches between them and UC Irvine, with the Anteaters besting them in their last matchup with a 3-0 clean sweep before the beginning of the postseason.</p>\n<p>Players to watch for the Gauchos include senior outside hitter Corey Chavers and freshman outside hitter Ryan Wilcox. Chavers leads his side in scoring with a total of 313 kills on the season. Wilcox, who continues his impressive rookie campaign, follows next with 214 kills to his name. With both players in the Big West top 10 for scoring, this Chavers and Wilcox combo is definitely a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>In UC Irvine’s corner, the Anteaters have a trio of attackers in senior opposite Karl Apfelbach, senior outside hitter Aaron Koubi and sophomore outside hitter Joel Schneidmiller, who are all capable of doing some damage. However, the scoring leader of the bunch, Schneidmiller, has yet to play a set since his last match against BYU back in March. With his status still in question, UCSB should game plan against the next immediate danger from Apfelbach and Koubi.</p>\n<p>All the action begins first on the road as UCSB visits UC Irvine this Friday, April 12 at 7 p.m. Then the Gauchos will return home for their second bout against the Anteaters on the following day, Saturday, April 13 at 7 p.m. in the Robertson Gymnasium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 8 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87379\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-3-ucsb-to-close-out-regular-season-with-pair-of-matches-against-no-9-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87379\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-3-ucsb-to-close-out-regular-season-with-pair-of-matches-against-no-9-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-3-ucsb-to-close-out-regular-season-with-pair-of-matches-against-no-9-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-3-ucsb-to-close-out-regular-season-with-pair-of-matches-against-no-9-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-3-ucsb-to-close-out-regular-season-with-pair-of-matches-against-no-9-uc-irvine/","id":5583,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[5582,5581,5580],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 17 UCSB Splits Final Two Matches of the Regular Season, Awaits Final Seeding For Conf.

On the ‘Chos second possession of the game, sophomore utility Sarah Snyder was able to find the back of the net to give UCSB an early 1-0 lead over the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>Less than 30 seconds later, Hawaii would respond with a goal from Junior utility Femke Aan, giving her 34 goals on the year to knot the game up at 1-1.</p>\n<p>With momentum on their side, the Rainbow Wahine were able to score another goal as freshman utility Carmen Baringo netted her first of two goals on the day to give Hawaii a 2-1 lead going into the second period.</p>\n<p>Hawaii would dominate the second period as they not only scored three goals but also did not allow UCSB to score a goal in the entire period, which put the halftime score at 5-1 in favor of the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>In the third period, Santa Barbara and Hawaii would both score on two straight possessions each to make things interesting after two goals from Simmons and junior utility Sarah Kreiser for the ‘Chos and two goals for Hawaii from redshirt senior utility Chloe Barr to put the game at 7-3. Barr would score another goal later in the period, giving her five goals on the match and 42 on the year.</p>\n<p>With the score at 9-3 in favor of Hawaii to start the fourth period, UCSB would look to find some offensive rhythm to build upon for their match against the Aggies, just a day later.</p>\n<p>Junior center Emily Martin was able to end the scoring drought for Santa Barbara as she scored with just one minute left in the game. The Rainbow Wahine added two more goals in the period and the game ended with a final score of 11-4.</p>\n<p>Just 24 hours later, the Gauchos were back in the pool as they faced a red-hot Aggies squad, that is currently 18-9 overall on the year, with a 3-2 conference record. This game was the last regular season home game for Santa Barbara which meant that it was the last time senior defender Annie Mortimer would suit up for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Mortimer came into the game with five goals and six assists on the year and looked to get a win in her last home game for the ‘Chos.</p>\n<p>In the first period, sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder would start off strong for Santa Barbara as she had two early saves.</p>\n<p>On a power play with 3:54 remaining in the period, Simmons netted her first goal of the day off of a pass from Mortimer giving UCSB an early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>UC Davis did not have any offensive rhythm in the first period and looked to change that as the second period started. Just a minute into the period, sophomore attacker Kathleen Schafle would tie the game up for the Aggies.</p>\n<p>After a couple of defensive stands from both teams, Kreiser would score for the Gauchos giving them a one-goal advantage. Junior utility Annie Kutt would net her only goal of the game for UC Davis to lock things up at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder would later score with two minutes remaining in the second period as she launched a ball over UC Davis’ keeper but once again Schafle would score for the Aggies, putting the score at 3-3 going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Mortimer would start things off in the second half by scoring her first goal of the game which ignited the crowd at the Newport Beach Native was not only able to put a goal away on her senior day but also give Santa Barbara the lead.</p>\n<p>After the game was tied at five goals apiece, Simmons and Sophomore Attacker Natalie Selin would each net goals to give UCSB a 7-5 lead heading into the fourth period.</p>\n<p>Simmons would complete her hat trick in the fourth period off of a great pass from Sarah Snyder on a fast break and after two crucial saves from Kenzi Snyder, Kreiser would put the game away with a goal that put the final score at 9-5.</p>\n<p>Simmons led the way for the ‘Chos as she finished the weekend with four goals, three steals, and one assist.</p>\n<p>Despite not being the biggest in the pool, Simmons continues to find ways to make a positive impact on her team.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I am not a big player,” Simmons stated. “I have to use my mobility and speed to get goals.”</p>\n<p>With this marking Mortimer’s last regular season for the ‘Chos, she ended up finishing in style with one goal and two assists.</p>\n<p>“This is definitely bittersweet,” Mortimer stated. “It feels really good to go out on a win and I think that was one of our best games of the season. We all played really well together and everyone contributed which made it a great game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to continue their momentum from this weekend as they head into the conference tournament in two weeks.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will head to Irvine on April 27th where their opponent has yet to be determined to compete in the Big West Tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82483\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/no-17-ucsb-splits-final-two-matches-of-the-regular-season-awaits-final-seeding-for-conf-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82483\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/no-17-ucsb-splits-final-two-matches-of-the-regular-season-awaits-final-seeding-for-conf-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/no-17-ucsb-splits-final-two-matches-of-the-regular-season-awaits-final-seeding-for-conf-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/no-17-ucsb-splits-final-two-matches-of-the-regular-season-awaits-final-seeding-for-conf-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/no-17-ucsb-splits-final-two-matches-of-the-regular-season-awaits-final-seeding-for-conf-tournament/","id":5584,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[5583,5582,5581],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
