","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista is a town full of young college-aged students who spend a lot of time in the sun and look pretty damn good. It makes sense that there’s a lot of sex happening. What also happens quite a bit is getting interrupted during the act. It’s happened to almost everybody I know, and in many different compromising … positions. Most recently I was interrupted during the fulfillment of a certain job, which is taxing enough given the need to control one’s gag reflex and also give pleasure at the same time. I heard a door open and paused — dick in mouth. I looked up to make direct eye contact with a housemate who had gone into the adjoining room for who knows what.</p>\n<p>In another circumstance we could’ve laughed it off, but in this case, it felt as though she was more offended than I or the guy I was with was. This brings me to the question: in a place where most people are having sex, and we’re stacked on top of each other sometimes three to a room, why do some people get upset when they hear or see people having sex? Why is it surprising and why can’t people just knock?</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

But outside of our nuclear friend groups there are social stigmas that attach themselves to our sexual actions which reach back to how we are taught about sex, and the social climate of the United States as a whole. The walk of shame, for example, is seemingly only something that exists for women. Walking through the hallways of a frat in which you may have hooked up with someone, you’re more likely to be greeted with catcalls than high fives, and the promenade home opens you up to a bevy of evil eye glances and calls of the word “slut.”</p>\n<p>Men have a completely different experience. Maybe it’s because their going-out clothes transition better from night to day, but either way, the difference is stark. We all do it, want to do it and if we haven’t we most likely will eventually, so the idea that people are shamed in a place where people wear ass-bearing shorts more often than coats or sweaters is inane and harmful.</p>\n<blockquote><p>…a friend of mine was overheard getting nasty at midnight on a Sunday in her <i>single</i> and told by her roommate that it “hurt her soul” to hear her</p></blockquote>\n<p>In one of the best and perhaps most upsetting examples of being shamed for something entirely natural, a friend of mine was overheard getting nasty at midnight on a Sunday in her <i>single</i> and told by her roommate that it “hurt her soul” to hear her (she had also assumed the people in question were being loud purposely, knowing she was outside). My friend was rightly confused as to why it was assumed she was being blatantly exhibitionist without at least a clarification first; but more troublingly, why did the knowledge that sex was happening near her hurt her soul? I’d be happy for whoever was getting it, but that’s just me. At the very least, I’d suggest putting in a pair of headphones and continuing on with your life. The idea that someone could be judged in the middle of an intimate act is something, that if I had the time and money to complete a second degree at UCSB, I most definitely would devote a thesis to studying.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s one thing to be on a dance floor somewhere or outside in plain sight. But what I mean specifically is when you’re in your room…</p></blockquote>\n<p>All of this can culminate in a denial that seems to shock most of us when we see somebody getting it, giving it or what have you. It’s one thing to be on a dance floor somewhere or outside in plain sight. But what I mean specifically is when you’re in your room (mine is a single so it happens more rarely) or in a private place you wouldn’t expect someone to walk in unannounced. This can be jarring for all parties involved. For example, imagine my surprise when during one of the activities in question, I heard a loud knock on my bedroom door. I was home alone at the time except for the guy with me of course, so I was thoroughly confused.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was one of the situations where the most confident version of myself would’ve walked up to the door bare-ass naked and told the intruder to leave, but instead I said nobody was home (which clearly wasn’t true), giggled and went back to what I was doing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This situation really arose from a lack of boundaries because it turned out that a friend of my housemate’s wanted to know if she was home and apparently wasn’t deterred by the sounds coming from my room. It was one of the situations where the most confident version of myself would’ve walked up to the door bare-ass naked and told the intruder to leave, but instead I said nobody was home (which clearly wasn’t true), giggled and went back to what I was doing. In a situation where your privacy has been violated, as is the case much of the time, I think it’s fair to have a little fun and make sure the party that’s really guilty gets at least as embarrassed as you did.</p>\n<p>I guess the last thing that must be discussed is what to do when you catch someone in the act. If I didn’t really know the person, I’d apologize and make a hasty exit. If it were a friend, I’d do the same, and then high five them and ask for details later. But I suppose the best advice I have is never judge because it will almost inevitably happen to you, just based on the number of times you’re likely to have sex during your lifetime. Not only this, but remember to always, <i>always</i> knock.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Sebastianne Kent can’t imagine a scenario where you shouldn’t knock, just to make sure.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70423\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70423\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/girl-and-boy-interrupted/","id":6302,"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent"},"related":[6301,6300,6299],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":410,"name":"Sebastianne Kent","biography":"Not available","articles":[6300,6302,6309,6339],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Sex Over Spring Break… The Safe Way","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spring-break-sex.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spring-break-sex.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Allie Lebos encourages you to think before you hop into bed over spring break.

This is every college student’s dream. This is Spring Break. It is the one week out of the year when losing your dignity and class is socially acceptable, and somewhat expected. Whether you stay in I.V. (where it’s basically Spring Break every week) or make your way to Mexico or Panama City Beach for some traditional Spring Break festivities, you’re guaranteed some crazy stories and fun memories. However, with great fun comes great responsibility. When combining heavy drinking and large quantities of attractive, but belligerent college students, it’s important to be alert and aware so that your Spring Break experience doesn’t turn sour. Wouldn’t you rather come home with a nice tan rather than a not-so-nice rash?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hooking up on Spring Break can be exciting and sexy for many reasons. The most obvious being that you will most likely never see the person ever again. The aroma of boxed wine, cigarette smoke and lack of commitment has a certain appeal to it. While these spontaneous affairs can be exhilarating and fun, it’s important to keep your wits about you. I learned this the hard way. Last year during Spring Break, I went on a trip to Panama City Beach, Florida (aka Spring Break capital of the world) with a group of my friends from Texas. I knew it would be an insane trip, and I couldn’t wait. The first couple of days were a blast. I was the perfect amount of drunk to enjoy the utter chaos that is PCB, yet still coherent and functioning. On our third day there, I drank way too much at the beach. I don’t remember how or when I got back to my hotel, but I woke up on a lawn chair on our hotel balcony. After waking up completely disoriented, and still hammered, my friends and I continued to drink in order to get ready for the bars. Pretty much everything that happens after that is extremely blurry. I apparently decided to take a shower after already having my hair and makeup done, and when I got out of the shower, there was a group of German students in my hotel room. I know, completely random. Turns out these guys were our hotel neighbors, and my friends had invited them over to pregame with us. In my intoxicated state, I struck up somewhat of a conversation with one of the guys that I thought was attractive (I say somewhat because he didn’t really speak English, and I could barely form sentences). After a very short amount of time, I ended up bed with him, and I have very little recollection of what happened. The only thing I remember is making him put on a new condom every three minutes because I was so scared that we weren’t using one. If I couldn’t even be aware enough of the fact that we were using protection, there is absolutely no reason why I should have been having sex. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After sobering up and realizing what I had done, I felt horrible. I had never had a sexual experience like that, and I was completely disappointed in my actions and judgment. I knew it was completely irresponsible and dangerous to get that drunk, but I did it anyway. Had I been more aware of my actions, I never would have slept with someone who was basically a stranger while completely belligerent. I knew I had no one to blame except myself. Even though I was much too drunk to be making the choice to have sex, he was as well, and we both willingly engaged in the act. It was a poor decision fueled by a lack of rational thought. After finding out that we did for sure use protection, I felt much better about the situation, but still disappointed. I began to realize that something much worse could have happened. Every year, horrible assault and rape stories emerge on the news from Spring Break. Just this past year, at the same location that I was at, a girl was raped by a group of guys on a public beach in front of a ton of students. The horrible crime was even filmed by cowardly, idiotic kids. The girl was completely unconscious as she was assaulted and violated. While the rape was 100 percent the fault of the rapists, the fact that other students didn’t intervene in the situation due to their partying and alcohol consumption is absolutely asinine. As sad as it is, our society has perpetuated this idea that rape is “normal” or “acceptable.” Rather than helping, people aimlessly watched and ignored a cruel act committed against a clearly vulnerable person in need. It is truly sad that we live in a society that promotes teaching women “how to not be raped or assaulted,” rather than teaching others to simply “not rape or assault.” However, until that changes, it is important to not make yourself even more vulnerable to those unthinkable acts, whether you’re male or female.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being uncontrollably intoxicated is neither safe nor fun for many reasons. For one, you may make a regrettable and scary decision such as I did, or, you may lose valuable intuition and defenses that can help protect you when facing a threatening situation. Secondly, sex is so much better when you feel comfortable, secure and certain. Trust me. Spring Break is supposed to be one of the best weeks of the year, so know your limits, party hard and make the most of it. Oh, and as tempting as beaded necklaces can be, don’t flash your boobs for Snapchat. Those pictures will haunt you. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68735\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68735\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/sex-over-spring-break-the-safe-way/","id":6299,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6298,6297,6296],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"BDSM: Keep It Mutual","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Logo-Featured1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Logo-Featured1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","description":"I heard my friend’s story and was absolutely appalled.

It almost brought tears to my eyes, and it wasn’t just because she’d been hurt and humiliated, but overwhelmingly because she didn’t think there was anything wrong with it.</p>\n<p>When <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> swept our previously entirely vanilla cultural sex-scape, we were collectively dumbfounded by the open and unabashed display of a type of sexual activity that had been decidedly fringe. All of the sudden, there were BDSM-themed workout classes, outfits, makeup palettes and of course sex toys. The world of BDSM had been blown wide open for everyone to see (and enjoy) and I never really thought of it as an issue. In fact, it has been a point of intrigue I didn’t mind exploring, but for myself, and as I’d find later, for others, it took a dark turn.</p>\n<p>Romance novels such as <em>Twilight</em> and <em>Fifty Shades of Grey </em>drew scrutiny not because of the characters’ sex-capades (which in <em>Fifty Shades of Grey </em>were outlined and specified in a contract) but because of the controlling nature of the relationship itself. They were scrutinized for the man in the relationship following or tracking his <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">prey</span> girlfriend to make sure she’s safe, as if she’s not capable of doing that herself. What’s troubling about the level of control present in those relationships isn’t that it exists but that so many women seem to find it romantic. Why would we idealize a relationship founded on inequality and control? Sex is one thing, but a BDSM relationship leaves you with emotional scars that are much harder to erase.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The mark of these books on the women who read them varies depending greatly on the individual. Many of us can take these things with a grain of salt and read them as the entertaining sizzlers that they are. But hearing the horror stories experienced by the more impressionable or less empowered (neither of which I intend as a disparagement) turns the mind towards the lack of feminist education in our society. Some people like to be dominated, and some people like to be in control. However, in any relationship, understanding and mutual respect are key to lasting interaction.</p>\n<p>When my friend texted me mid rendezvous with her long time crush, I was really happy for her. As I heard more I became increasingly alarmed.</p>\n<p>“This is Christian Grey shit. He’s, like, beating me up, and I think I like it?” My worry was immediately incited.</p>\n<p>“He’s so hot I can’t dislike it, like slapping me in the face. Is that a thing?” I told her it could be she was enjoying it, but that I didn’t think that was what you’d expect the first time you hooked up with someone. More troubling was when I found out that type of sexual aggression was the reason they initially broke up.</p>\n<p>“Now I realize dominatrix is a thing … I’m gonna get drunk. Hopefully when he chokes me I’ll still be able to breathe. So far chances are slim.”</p>\n<p>Take a second with that. I know I needed to.</p>\n<p>I could input the whole conversation and feel like I was getting my point across. But this is about my friend as an exemplar of young women who feel like they need to put in huge amounts of effort to be accepted or feel desired, and seeing the rest of the conversation and how miserable she was might sadden you to the extent that it detracts from the larger picture. My point in this is that it isn’t fair. What made me even more upset hearing this is that there was no practiced, nuanced sexual experimentation. She didn’t orgasm because of a well-placed crop flick or a firm but practiced touch. There was no mutual enjoyment. He didn’t take a moment to think about her or her feelings, and saying no wasn’t enough for him to stop because there was no safe word and he just thought of it as part of the game. This was a young woman being taken advantage of because our society has fetishized controlling relationships and brought kink to the surface without offering enough context and making clear what is and isn’t okay.</p>\n<p>I told her, and have told friends on many occasions, my mantra, which is “she who holds the pussy holds the power.” It’s easy to say but not as easy to believe. It doesn’t mean you rule your relationships, but it means you get equal say in them and complete dominion over what happens to your body. If whips and chains do it for you, get trussed up like a Thanksgiving turkey and have all the fun in the world. But playing powerless and being powerless are two different things; going into something with a stranger, or even someone you’re close to, while feeling helpless, powerless, terrified and alone is one thing, if that’s your goal (which is a whole different article), but is entirely another animal when you just wanted to have some fun. We live in a time of complete contradiction, and sometimes it feels like the sexual revolution only made things easier for men because women still get the brunt of the judgment.</p>\n<p>While there are thousands of intricate threads that comprise our collective attitude towards sex, self-respect is an ironclad principle.

If you’re just sleeping with someone, no strings attached, should you cuddle after sex? Doesn’t cuddling imply some sort of emotional attachment? While it would seem that the act of getting naked and having sex would be much more intimidating than simply spooning, this isn’t always the case.  Obviously, the best way to avoid this uncertainty is to ensure that you and your partner are both on the same page in regards to what you’re wanting out of your relationship. While unwanted snuggling can be awkward, it’s not nearly as bad as being scurried out after just giving yourself to someone intimately. Once your intentions have been established, it’s important to make sure that your cuddling doesn’t cross boundaries that can turn it into smothering.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>Honestly, who can truly get a good night’s sleep with someone else literally breathing down your neck? Do you not overheat from having another person’s body attach onto your own?</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I enjoy the occasional cuddling. It can feel comforting and reassuring, especially when a romantic connection is involved. However, when it comes to sleeping, I prefer to maintain my own space. My all-time favorite sleeping position is by far on my side. I feel like it gives me the opportunity to be the most flexible, as well as being the optimal positioning for temperature control (one leg out of the covers, one leg in, etc.). However, I’ve come to the realization that this position seems to appear as an invitation for spooning when laying in bed with someone else, especially post-sex. Originally, I figured the body language associated with this position was, “Ok, I’ve rolled over away from you now, don’t touch me.” Unfortunately, I have been proven wrong. Honestly, who can truly get a good night’s sleep with someone else literally breathing down your neck? Do you not overheat from having another person’s body attach onto your own? Especially in Isla Vista, where air conditioning is basically non-existent, how does anyone deal with the sweltering conditions that come with having someone lay basically all of their body weight on top of you? It’s a phenomenon that I can’t seem to figure out, along with handholding. I think holding hands when cuddling is sweet and romantic, but when you’re trying to pass out, it’s not exactly ideal. It’s rather restricting and uncomfortable. Having your fingers intertwined with anyone else’s while unconscious doesn’t seem pleasant, nor safe, especially if you roll around a lot like me. I completely understand wanting to show affection after hooking up, and I firmly believe that it helps to create and sustain a bond, but at the same time, a restful slumber is not something to be compromised.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Of course the feeling of waking up next to a loved one is beautiful and sensual, but no one looks good at 7 a.m.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Cuddling can also take a wrong turn the morning after; when you’ve just woken up groggy, unprepared and unattractive. Of course the feeling of waking up next to a loved one is beautiful and sensual, but no one looks good at 7 a.m.  You have yet to freshen up your hair and face. You have yet to brush your teeth. And chances are, you probably really have to pee. It can be unbelievably unpleasant to be woken up with an embrace, especially when it’s unexpected. Mornings are meant to be peaceful, easy and slow, not awkward and stressful. Waking up to being grabbed and kissed is sometimes startling and quite honestly, annoying. I prefer to have a little bit of time to collect myself and come together before being overwhelmed with tenderness and care. After I’ve gargled some Listerine and fully come to, I think some morning-time endearment is great. But until then, I need some space to start my day off right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of what your relationship status is, some people find post-sex cuddling to be a necessity, while others can do without it. I personally think finding a healthy balance is the best route to go. Boundaries are necessary in every aspect of a relationship, even when it comes to something as small as cuddling. Finding that comfortable middle can help ensure that you still feel desired and loved, without feeling suffocated. </span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos advocates for a healthy amount of cuddling, done at the right time. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69833\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69833\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/when-cuddling-turns-to-smothering/","id":6301,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6300,6299,6298],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
