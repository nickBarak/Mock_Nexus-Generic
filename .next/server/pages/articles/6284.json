It is a time when sentiment and emotion fill the air. Whether you’re a Scrooge who thinks the holiday season is just one big marketing scheme or a Christmas fanatic who puts their tree up in October, I think it’s safe to say this time of year causes a lot of us to reminisce and reflect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, being single during a time of so much love and connection can lead to feelings of loneliness or fear. It’s pretty much impossible to escape the constant romance and adoration filling every street corner, movie and song. On top of that, it’s cuddle weather 24/7. Getting through December can be rough for many, but nothing comes close to the stress of facing the dreaded New Year’s Kiss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not sure who came up with idea of a New Year’s Kiss, but it’s never been one of my favorite holiday traditions. Don’t get me wrong; I think the concept of it is great. It’s meant to be nothing more than a positive and light-hearted way to kick off a fresh start. In fact, New Year’s Eve is probably my favorite night of the entire year. I just hate the pressure that comes with wondering if you’ll be getting that kiss at midnight. Unless you’re in a committed relationship and spending the evening with that person, you don’t really know what your night is going to hold.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p>Unless you’re in a committed relationship and spending the evening with that person, you don’t really know what your night is going to hold.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For some people, that’s part of the fun; not knowing with whom or how you’re going to jump into the next 365 days. I’ve definitely had years in which I went into the night with that mentality and I came out the next day feeling like my year started off on a pretty good note.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the clock ticks closer to 12, it can be pretty comical to watch others search the room aimlessly for a potential comrade. If you haven’t locked one down by 11:50 p.m., you might be in some trouble. As the bar begins to shout “10, 9, 8, 7…” humans of all kinds come together to share that special and sometimes awkward midnight moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren’t one of the lucky ones who found their Midnight McDreamy, you can settle for kissing one of your friends, or perhaps finding a fellow last-minute loner. Considering the fact that I’ve never been in a relationship on New Year’s Eve, these have always been my go-to tactics, and they seem to have worked out decently. Plus, any time I felt that twinge of disappointment, I would tell myself: There’s always next year.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this year, I feel a little differently about getting that kiss at midnight. This year, I don’t really have any desire to enter into 2017 with some meaningless, drunk kiss. As cliché as it sounds, the New Year can truly mean a new chapter. For some of us, it can be the motivation we need to make real and difficult changes in our lives. It can be what inspires us to work toward being the best versions of ourselves. Maybe some years, you’re really meant to celebrate your fresh start with just you, and not a stranger in a bar.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you aren’t one of the lucky ones who found their Midnight McDreamy, you can settle for kissing one of your friends, or perhaps finding a fellow last-minute loner.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While strangers in bars can be fun, they can’t come close to giving you the joy you can give yourself. They also can’t replace the void that’s been left by the person you wish you were kissing at midnight. If you’re one of those people who aren’t just dealing with being single on New Year’s, but also with being heartbroken, it can be a double dose of hurt. It’s pretty much impossible not to wonder who they’ll be kissing when the clock strikes 12, and you know you’ll be wishing it were you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, circumstance and timing just don’t allow for miracles to happen, even during the holidays. While this reality can be frustrating and difficult to face, it doesn’t mean you should settle. If you know in your heart how you feel, and who you feel it for, not one person in that bar is going to fill that void. Not one person in that bar is going live up to your expectations. Not one person in that bar is going to give you the kiss you actually want.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, some years we actually do get that movie-moment kiss and fantasize about what the next 365 days may hold. Other years we end the night by tucking ourselves in bed, reminiscing on the 365 days that just passed. This year, I know that no matter what 2017 may bring, I have myself to face it with. Being secure and confident in yourself is one of the most difficult yet important lessons we are forced to learn as humans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving love and acceptance toward ourselves means we know who we are and what we stand for, regardless of mistakes or faults we may posses. It means you don’t need anyone other than yourself to feel validated and valued.  </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not getting that kiss at midnight doesn’t matter because you started your year off with someone who can never be replaced: you. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74641\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74641\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-28/when-the-clock-strikes-twelve/","id":6284,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6283,6282,6281],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos","biography":"Not available","articles":[6284,6286,6292,6299,6301,6303,6304,6305,6308,6342,6362],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Separating Artists From Their Art: When Are They #Canceled?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Virtual Reality","publish_date":"2019-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/art-v-artist.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Alysha Agarwal debates the severity of #canceled culture in the age of the Internet, and where we should really draw the line.

In the last year, we’ve seen celebrities accused of sexual assault be “canceled” and all their work invalidated and boycotted. But it doesn’t stop there: celebrities that make just about any mistake fall into the same category of “canceled” as these accused celebrities.

Twitter blew up in outrage at these rediscovered tweets, and Hart was #canceled as quickly as he was appointed to host. His past tweets caused so much controversy that Hart</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KevinHart4real/status/1070906075812118529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1070906075812118529&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fkevin-hart-oscars-withdrawal%2F\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">withdrew</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from hosting the award show.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as Hart explained in his</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXtlGdPenbc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> interview with Ellen DeGeneres</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he had already apologized for these old tweets and had been trying to learn from his mistakes and move forward with his life. Twitter didn’t take a second to breathe and do background research before exploding on Hart for his mistakes. This is where the debate of whether or not art should be viewed as separate from the artist comes in: should Kevin Hart be allowed to perform given his problematic past?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the internet fad of canceling celebrities at the snap of a finger, it was much easier for consumers to draw a line between an artist and their art. In modern society, however, that line is blurred and sometimes nonexistent. Picasso was misogynistic, yet his art is still considered some of the best in the world. William Golding was an attempted rapist, but his book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lord of the Flies </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is still taught in high schools across the nation. J.D. Salinger was a pedophile, yet he is considered one of the greatest American authors of all time, and his book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Catcher in the Rye </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is one of the most widely-read novels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, consumers of entertainment have decided to take more responsibility for holding celebrities accountable for their actions, but it has gotten to the point where celebrities can’t take a single step out of place without risking everything. I’m in no way condoning the previously mentioned artists’ behavior; I’m just stating that these artists are different from their art and their work, and that their personalities should be considered separately. Supporting an artist’s work is not equivalent to supporting their actions, to a certain extent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This line gets a little hazy with artists who haven’t just made small mistakes. On one end of the spectrum of #canceled celebrities are celebrities like Kevin Hart and on the other end are celebrities like Tekashi 6ix9ine, R. Kelly and Bill Cosby. For the latter artists mentioned, it becomes harder to support their work without feeling like you’re condoning their actions. Although there is an extreme difference between Kevin Hart’s eight-year-old homophobic tweets and Bill Cosby’s </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/arts/television/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-allegations-timeline.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple sexual assault charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, both have fallen victim to canceled culture. Making the separation between an artist and their art was definitely easier before the Internet, and although I believe it’s still important, it becomes more difficult with celebrities on the extreme end of the spectrum.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a wide range of actions that can make a celebrity fall victim to the hashtag, and what irks me is that no matter where you fall on this spectrum, you get sentenced to #canceled for life.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think a good middle ground that society can take on this issue is to be more accepting and lenient towards work from artists who have made active efforts to learn from their mistakes and move forward. Let me be clear: this doesn’t apply to the Bill Cosbys or R. Kellys of the world, but it does apply to the Kevin Harts. Kevin Hart has made a public and conscious effort to right his wrongs and move on with his life, and we should not judge his comedy in light of his personal mistakes. We’re putting too much pressure on ourselves as consumers to evaluate what should and shouldn’t be appreciated due to the actions of their creators. Instead, we should appreciate art for what it is, rather than blaming ourselves for “supporting” an artist’s slightly problematic past.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alysha Agarwal urges people to discern between an artist’s actions and their work.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Of course you have; you’re a human living in the 21st century. Have you ever caught yourself mindlessly scrolling through social media and been jealous of something that someone is doing? You are not alone; I tend to follow people who are way cooler than myself. Most importantly, have you ever caught yourself mindlessly scrolling through social media and felt sad that you aren’t as “happy” or “fulfilled” as someone on social media?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have never been someone who gets crazy insecure from looking at other people’s social media profiles. Sure, I wish I could travel the world like those influencers, or get paid for selling “miracle” tea, but I’ve always been pretty good about taking things with a grain of salt. However, coming into my second year at UCSB, I began seeing all these people doing so many cool things on social media, and it made me question if I was missing out. All the sorority girls looked so happy together with all their 400 friends! All the Adventure Program kids seemed so freakin’ peaceful and content with their outdoorsy lives. All the people who like playing die and chilling with their homies seemed fulfilled, like they couldn’t ask for anything more. Seeing all these people on social media who seemed so adult, I questioned if I should be doing more to get on that level of happiness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With school starting, I pushed myself to get involved in more things in order to find more places that made me feel comfortable, fulfilled and just genuinely happy like the people I follow seemed to be. I joined a sorority, started surfing with Excursion Club and felt that amazing freedom that comes with living in Isla Vista in a house with all new people.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the next week, I met a bunch of new people in these activities, through my new housemates and in classes. Many of these people looked like those I had seen on social media. Talking to them, though, I learned how much of a struggle it was to find friends. How difficult it was to branch out. How overwhelming school was, and how homesick they were. How lonely, stressed and worn out they felt. These people that had seemed so satisfied with their lives on their social media suddenly seemed … normal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, let me get something straight. Everyone has their problems and of course social media cannot hide the fact that we are young adults in college. But social media does have the ability to hide all of the daily insecurities and worries that all people experience. When scrolling through Instagram or Snapchat stories, sometimes we forget that no one constantly feels secure in who they are. Everyone has bad days. Everyone feels lonely and sad sometimes. Everyone gets stressed at some point, whether about school, friends or life. Everyone wants to fit in and feel included.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up is about figuring out what you want from yourself and your life. Living in a one-mile radius with thousands of other people who are looking for the same thing as we are only exacerbates the idea of fitting in on social media. We want to know that we are making the most out of our experience. We want to feel loved, included and to not feel like we are missing out as we see those around us doing so many amazing things. However, we have to realize that everyone has the same insecurities as we do, and that it is human nature to feel this way. That girl who goes on vacations constantly is not all sunshine and rainbows on the inside 24/7. That guy who seems to just have so many damn friends faces the same times of loneliness many of us feel sometimes. Those people who seem so put together are close to falling apart at the seams, just like us. The important thing to understand is that social media never shows these things because who likes to expose their insecurities that they too try to forget about?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, let’s stop scrolling and scrolling when we are bored. Let’s work to limit our time that we spend looking at thousands of people on social media. Let’s catch ourselves when we begin to notice that we are comparing ourselves to incomplete identities. Behind the scenes of those photos lie a list of insecurities and problems that would never be seen on Instagram. I have friends who seemed to be having the time of their lives, but ultimately have transferred schools, started therapy or are just as stressed as the rest of us. You probably know people too! So, it’s time we stop comparing ourselves to these partial images we constantly subject ourselves to, and realize that happiness simply does not look the same for everyone. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grace Wiley is a second-year Isla Vistan who may or may not be scrolling through social media right now.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of us not entrenched in the world of sports, the Oscars have the tendency to be our Super Bowl. We host viewing parties, place bets on winning nominees and dissect the newcomers and veterans with an equal sense of spectacle. The Academy Awards hold a reputation of launching the careers of unknowns who metamorphose into Hollywood giants before our very eyes.  We’ve seen nominees like Hailee Steinfeld, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quvenzhané Wallis and this year’s newcomer Yalitza Aparicio transform their careers solely based off of Oscar buzz. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is apparent that this fanaticism does not stray from the stars of the pictures. Ask anyone to name you a producer of the film — a nominee of the coveted Best Picture Oscar — and they would likely balk.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For somebody who was nominated for the crème de la crème of awards, Peter Saraf is breathtakingly humble. He does not fit the image of a fast-paced, no-nonsense Hollywood producer. Saraf, his wife Erika, their teenage children Olive and Oscar and their schneagle Harry, live in a renovated two-story apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, just a stone’s throw from Central Park. The apartment walls are adorned with Erika’s paintings, as well as many done by her father, renowned painter Daniel E. Greene. There is no doubt that the Sarafs are certainly well off (a two-story apartment in Manhattan should have clued you in), yet their home is cozy and inviting — they know their doorman and their neighbors — practically the polar opposite of the fenced-in mega-mansions synonymous with reclusive members of the entertainment industry on the opposite coast.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf’s introduction to the film industry was no coincidence; his late father Irving Saraf was a quadruple-hyphenate producer-director-editor-academic, as well as an Academy Award-winning documentarian for his 1991 film “In the Shadow of the Stars”. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Saraf was in high school he had the opportunity to work as a production assistant on some of his father’s films, and get a better sense of his career. Make no mistake though, coming from a film dynasty did not pressure young Peter into his career in the entertainment industry — in fact sharing such a binding love of film with his father is what allowed Saraf a unique appreciation for the power of movies later in his career: “He and I shared a lot. We saw a lot of movies together, and that was just something that we did together all the time from as far back as I can remember,” he said with a twinge of admiration in his voice. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my life,” he said. After wandering about overseas, working odd production jobs and unsuccessful attempts to go to film school, Saraf found himself back in New York where he managed to get a job as an office manager for Jonathan Demme, who was best known as the director of the cult classic psychological horror film, “The Silence of the Lambs.” Saraf ended up working with Demme for 10 years: “It was my film school, it was my job, it’s where I learned really what a producer does, and where I learned that I liked producing and that I had a certain affinity for it.” He rose through the ranks from an office manager to producing documentaries, to narratives, to eventually becoming a partner of Demme’s and producing projects together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf has always had a knack for telling stories about human beings, and “Little Miss Sunshine” proved to be no exception. Many will fondly remember “Little Miss Sunshine” as the screamingly funny, horrifically inappropriate family road trip comedy that follows the Hoover family as they try to make it to Redondo Beach, Calif. for their daughter Olive to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The beloved script was well known and had been floating around industry purgatory for years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many found the film too risky to make: it was an R-rated comedy with an ensemble cast, with the plot centered on a child and it was unlikely to have a strong international audience, as child beauty pageants are a uniquely American cultural phenomenon.  In 2004, Saraf and his partner Marc Turtletaub co-founded their production company Big Beach. Turtletaub, who had been a developer of the script, dreamt of making the screenplay a reality. “We managed to get it back from the studio that owned it that wasn’t making it, and made it independently,” Saraf said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movie was filmed over the course of 30 days and premiered at Sundance in January 2006. In addition to scoring one of the best distribution deals of the festival and raking in $100.5 million at the box office, “Little Miss Sunshine” received rave reviews and heaps of nominations during the awards circuit that year, so Saraf and Turtletaub were eager to see if it would make the cut for the top five of the Academy Awards Best Picture nominees (which expanded in 2009 to include up to 10 films). </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86818\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26suns.2.600.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"860773318\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"86816\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86818\" data-attachment-id=\"86818\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-12/profiling-peter-saraf-the-man-behind-little-miss-sunshine/26suns-2-600/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26suns.2.600.jpg?fit=600%2C325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"26suns.2.600\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;A still from the 2004 cult classic Little Miss Sunshine.

Courtesy of The New York Times.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Achieving a nomination for Best Picture, as Saraf and Turtletaub accomplished with “Little Miss Sunshine,” however, is arguably the most daunting task of the entire Oscars process. Academy voter Curtis Clark explains that of the 24 branches of the Academy — which one joins on an invite-only basis — each branch is only responsible for nominations within its own domain, with the exception of Best Picture, which is the only category to receive nominations from all branches across the board. Clark is a renowned cinematographer and a recent recipient of the</span><a href=\"https://oscar.go.com/news/oscar-news/curtis-clark-to-receive-john-a-bonner-award\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (which is awarded by the Academy) for his exemplary contributions to the field. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf and Clark are quick to note the honor of being nominated for an Academy Award, but neither believes that it makes an enormous impact, career-wise. Clark acknowledges that for somebody who is not a member of the Academy, “it may have distinct opportunities for certain types of jobs,” but Saraf does not believe that his nomination has opened any doors for him, though “it doesn’t hurt to have ‘Oscar nominee’ associated with your name,” he admitted. He continued with a chuckle, “I say I’m an Oscar loser.” Saraf believes the true mark of success is the endurance of the movie over time. “People remember the movie more than it was nominated, and that to me is much more meaningful and impactful. I love that people still remember the movie and care about it and continue to watch it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The industry (and world) wide celebration of film and its unifying properties is what Saraf appreciates the most about awards season. He loves that the awards circuit seeks to honor the movies every year, and that its popularity amongst the laypeople signifies a much deeper connection. He does admit, however, that there is a nastier, political side of awards season that viewers are unaccustomed to seeing or hearing about. In Saraf’s eyes, this petty side of awards season is what detracts from its value; it is the antithesis of the pure, wholesome love of film that he grew up on when seeing double features with his father.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The seriousness of the Oscars — and its implications as a marketing tool for an extended life at the box office — has earned the entertainment industry an insurmountable sum of money, but has led to a more sinister side to what should ultimately be a celebration for achievement in film. “That gets translated into literally the kinds of things you would see in a political campaign. You have consultants who do opposition research on other movies and the people behind them,” he said. This “oppo research” includes digging up old tweets, unflattering quotes, accusations, allegations about the film’s credibility and so other kinds of dirty tricks you’d only imagine to find on a political drama (see this year’s hotly contested Best Picture winner “Green Book” for </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/green-book-oscar-chances-peter-farrelly-nick-vallelonga-controversies/580087/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prime examples</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of all of these).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The night of the Oscars doesn’t stand out as incredibly sharp in Saraf’s mind. He noted the foreign experience of being on the most impressive, star-studded red carpet in the world, but feeling completely invisible — even as a nominee for the most anticipated award of the program. He recalled being a bundle of nerves, the torturous feeling of being the last award of the night and the ridiculousness of the cash-only bar in the lobby (you’d think the most prestigious awards in the industry could splurge on free booze).</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was actually a little terrified that we were going to win because I was so nervous to be on that stage,” he said with a hearty laugh, before admitting that it was a disappointing loss, regardless.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf’s work has remained more of the indie variety since his nomination 12 years ago. Things seem to be looking big for Big Beach this year, however. Saraf and Turtletaub are loaded with projects in post-production as well as some in the works, including a Mr. Roger’s film starring Tom Hanks set to premier at Thanksgiving, “The Farewell” starring Hollywood breakout Awkwafina which premiered to rave reviews at Sundance and upcoming projects with Lasse Holström and Natalie Portman.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is impossible to compare the works of fellow nominees, being nominated alongside Clint Eastwood and Alejandro González Iñárritu must certainly create a sense of pressure and pride. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Saraf has often chosen to go off the beaten path and pursue the indie genre, it appears that maybe more than a decade after his Best Picture nomination he will find himself back in the mainstream. “There’s a bunch of stuff coming – I’m not exactly sure what we’re going to make next, but that’s what’s in the pipeline,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saraf isn’t feeling overwhelmed by pressure to earn another nomination, but rather he is continuing to do what he does best: tell the stories of human beings. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
