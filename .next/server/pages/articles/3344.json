The petition calls on the UCSC administration to pay the COLA and condemns “all attempts by the administration to intimidate striking student workers.”</p>\n<p>A Twitter account run by the strikers, with the description “Pay us enough to live here,” has been posting nearly every hour about the strike; a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bananaslums/status/1203915263726563328\">thread</a> posted about the strike explained that organizers have been calling for a COLA since Sept. 2019.</p>\n<p>UCSC <a href=\"https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/12/addressing-impacts-of-grad-student-strike.html\">released a statement</a> in response to the strike on Dec. 9, stating “Lack of affordable housing in Santa Cruz presents challenges for our students and for our community as a whole.”</p>\n<p>“We are actively working on short- and long-term solutions to address our students’ housing needs,” the statement says.</p>\n<p>Photos of the UCSB rally can be viewed below:</p>\n<p></p><p

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Pats O-Line vs. Falcons D-Line by Daniel Rubalcava</strong></p>\n<p>This week proves to be a big one as the Atlanta Falcons face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 51 this Sunday, Feb. 3, at 3:30 p.m. in Houston, Texas. A primetime matchup that often gets overlooked is set to happen in the trenches themselves, primarily revolving around the Falcons defensive line vs. the Patriots offensive line.</p>\n<p>Although not much credit is given regarding their offensive line, the Patriots have been much improved this season after an atrocious 2015-16 season. Much of this credit should be given to offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who has really turned this group around. Left tackle Nate Solder holds the fort down for QB Tom Brady, while Marcus Cannon solidifies the run game on the right side. Joe Thuney, David Andrews and Shaq Mason shore up the middle of the 10th best O-Line in the NFL via <em>Profootballfocus.com</em>.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although the Pats rank seventh among postseason teams in rushing with a modest 2.9 yards per rush, they rank second in passing with an average of 326.5 yards per game. These averages are the outcome of a sturdy offensive line that is healthy. For any quarterback, being provided time in the pocket is key, but it becomes even more advantageous for a quarterback such as Brady, who they protected well with the fifth best ranking in sacks allowed at 24.</p>\n<p>Opposite the line of scrimmage is the Atlanta Falcons, who are an elusive and strong front. This is despite the fact that they rank sixth and seventh in rush and pass defense, respectively, during the playoffs; the Falcons are giving up 5.3 yards per rush to opposing teams, but only 6.8 yards per pass.</p>\n<p>This has resulted in an average of 20.5 points allowed per game; however, Vic Beasley Jr., Jonathan Babineaux, Tyson Jackson, Dwight Freeney and Co. are going to try and limit Brady and the Patriots. They have achieved their average the past two games, but the Patriots’ offense is explosive, and this D-Line may have to battle in a game that could possibly lead to a shootout.</p>\n<p>But don’t count the Falcons out just yet. All eyes will be on Beasley Jr. after he ended the season with a league-leading 15.5 sacks.</p>\n<p>Super Bowl 51 is set to be a great one, with anticipation of a high scoring, offensively charged game that could get out of hand on the scoreboard. The matchup seems sized up to be a battle in the trenches, and it could be a result of which line is willing to push a little harder to obtain the coveted Lombardi Trophy.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Defense vs. Falcons Defense by Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>An old mantra of the NFL has been that “defense wins championships.” That hypothesis can both be supported in this year’s Super Bowl by the Patriots, who concluded the regular season with 5,223 yards allowed, the eighth fewest in the league.</p>\n<p>Yet it can be somewhat rejected, as the team graded out as subpar, finishing 16th in Football Outsiders’ defensive DVOA, known as Defense-adjusted Value Over Average, is a stat that measures the overall efficiency of the defense compared to league average.</p>\n<p>Atlanta is no greater on defense either, finishing the regular season ranked 27th in defensive DVOA, with the 25th defense according to total yards allowed (5,939). The unit has been playing well of late though, giving up 21 and 20 points in their first two playoff games against the Seahawks and Packers, respectively, both of which are teams with high offensive ceilings.</p>\n<p>Vic Beasley Jr. was a monster for the team all year, leading the league with 15.5 sacks. Although he’s yet to notch one in the playoffs thus far, the Falcons have sacked the quarterback five times in the past two games, suggesting Tom Brady will be under pressure all evening.</p>\n<p>In Brady’s two Super Bowl losses, a vicious opposing pass rush has been a common element and figures to be an essential factor in determining Sunday’s outcome.</p>\n<p>Atlanta has shown a penchant for creating chaos this postseason, amassing three interceptions, a forced fumble and a safety. New England has created five turnovers itself during the 2017 playoffs and will need to turn Matt Ryan over once or twice to have a shot at stopping this high-powered Falcons offense.</p>\n<p>The main playmakers in Kyle Shanahan’s offense, wide receiver Julio Jones, quarterback Matt Ryan and the backfield duo of Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman should be eager for a Patriots matchup that could work to their advantage.</p>\n<p>While New England allowed more than 20 points in only three games this regular season, it ranks 20th in defensive DVOA versus both number one receivers and running backs.</p>\n<p>But New England has put together a cohesive group on the defensive side of the ball, though the Patriots are bereft of the defensive superstars that have been a key component in each of Bill Belichick’s Super Bowl winning runs.</p>\n<p>No longer are the Pats depending on impact players such as Chandler Jones and Darrelle Revis from two years ago, who have been replaced by Chris Long and Logan Ryan, and it’s yet to be seen if this group can match up with a team as talented as the Atlanta Falcons.</p>\n<p>I’ll take Brady, though, who has only thrown two interceptions on the year and seems pretty intent on sticking it to Roger Goodell and co.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Defense vs. Falcons Backfield by Quinn Moslander</strong></p>\n<p>Although it will be only the Falcons’ second ever Super Bowl appearance compared to the Patriots’ record-high 10th, Sunday’s matchup could be thrilling, especially when looking at the Falcons backfield going against the Patriots defense.</p>\n<p>Ranked No. 3 in the NFL when defending against the run, opposing teams only complete 88.6 rushing yards per game on average, making evident the cohesiveness and ability of the Pats’ defensive line. New England has only allowed five rushing touchdowns in 18 games this season, including playoffs, while not allowing a single running back to rush for over 100 yards in a single game.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the field, the Atlanta Falcons backfield is No. 4 in the league, averaging 4.6 yards per run. They have managed to score 20 touchdowns off running plays during the regular season but will be challenged by the Patriots’ strong rushing defense.</p>\n<p>Propelling the Falcons’ offense are two particularly strong running backs in Tevin Coleman and Devonta Freeman. Twenty-three-year-old Coleman totaled 520 rushing yards in the regular season, scoring eight rushing touchdowns, averaging 4.4 yards per run and has not slowed his roll since season has ended. Coleman is also a huge threat out of the backfield as receiver where he totaled 421 yards on 31 receptions and added three more touchdowns.</p>\n<p>On 28 total touches this postseason, the Indiana alum has registered 143 total yards (86 yards rushing, 57 receiving) and two touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Teammate Freeman made it past the 1,000-yard mark for the second straight season rushing for a career-high 1,079 yards this year while, adding 11 rushing touchdowns. Like Coleman, Freeman also does a great job as a receiver as he totaled 54 receptions in the regular season for 462 yards and two touchdowns. In two games this season, Freeman rushed for over 100 yards and in both, the Falcons won by an average margin of 20.5 points. In his two postseason games, Freeman has totaled 207 total yards and two touchdowns on 36 touches.</p>\n<p>With experience as well as energy on their side, the Patriots present a strong front that could help lead the team to victory if their defensive ends can cover the outside.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Offense vs. Falcons Offense by Ryan Burns</strong></p>\n<p>Super Bowl LI has potential to be an offensive clash for the ages, as the Falcons and Patriots, arguably the two best offenses in the NFL, flex their muscles on the biggest stage. Beyond the most notable matchup between perennial champion Tom Brady and veteran Matt Ryan — who has taken his game to a whole new level this season — throwing for a career high 38 TDs, both teams boast a countless number of threats that could make for a memorable game.</p>\n<p>If the defenses show up on their top game as expected, though, the running game will be key in deciding which team controls the tempo. Patriots RB LeGarrette Blount has been having a Super Bowl-worthy season, with 18 regular season TDs, adding one more in his team’s AFC Championship victory over the Steelers.</p>\n<p>His counterpart is no slouch either, as Falcons RB Devonta Freeman enters the title bout with 11 rushing TDs in the regular season while eclipsing 1,000 yards for the second straight season.<br>\nAtlanta heads into the big game with a slight edge in nearly every offensive category, with 295.3 yards in the air per game compared to New England’s 269.3 and 38 passing scores to 32.</p>\n<p>On the ground, the Falcons keep their advantage from their three-pronged running game with 120.5 yards per game and 20 TDs to the Patriots’ 117.0 YPG and 19 TDs.</p>\n<p>The Patriots’ biggest strength lies in their two main receiving targets for Brady, Julian Edelman and Martellus Bennett, who have combined for 1,800 receiving yards and 10 TDs this year, while the former was targeted 158 times, more than twice any other teammate. Matt Ryan’s number one target, Julio Jones, has had years to develop a relationship with his quarterback and the benefits this season were remarkable; Jones gathered over 1,400 receiving yards and seven TDs, averaging just over 100 YPG.</p>\n<p>Both teams have playmakers at every key offensive position and both offensive lines give the quarterbacks enough time to control the game, so the spotlight will obviously be on the two star QBs; that being said, it’ll be up to one of the skill players to come up with a game-winning play in the end.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>New England ended the regular season with 1,872 total rushing yards, 117 rushing yards per game and 19 rushing touchdowns. Each total had a top finish in the league at seventh in total rushing yards, seventh in rushing yards per game and fifth in rushing touchdowns in the league.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Patriots’ backfield has been able to keep up their regular season success in the postseason as they have averaged 77.5 rushing yards per game and have two touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Blount led the league in rushing touchdowns with 18 this year and has one touchdown in the postseason. Blount has served as the go-to back for the Patriots’ offense, but Lewis and White have been able to positively affect the offense with their own unique skill sets.</p>\n<p>Lewis, the smaller scat back, has only gotten better since coming off of an ACL injury earlier in the year and is a big play threat due to his mix of speed, agility, and elusiveness.</p>\n<p>While Blount and Lewis will most likely see a large share of touches, White has proven he can come up clutch in situations when given the chance as well.</p>\n<p>Atlanta’s defense has been below average against the run this year as it allowed 15 rushing touchdowns and 104.5 rushing yards per game, making them 19th in touchdowns allowed and 17th in rushing yards per game. Despite their regular season trouble, the Falcons base nickel defense has not allowed a rushing touchdown this postseason.</p>\n<p>The Falcons’ young defense is looking to continue their success as players like Keanu Neal, Vic Beasley Jr. and Deion Jones are defensive playmakers who can put a dent into the success of the Patriots’ trio of backs. Their defense should be well prepared to try and stop the versatile Patriots backfield.</p>\n<p>However, I feel the Patriots’ amount of offensive weapons in both the pass and rush game will be too much for the Falcons to handle, leaving the opportunity for the New England backfield to shine. I predict the final score will be 31-28, with the Patriots hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy once again.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats WRs vs. Falcons Secondary by Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p>While they might not compare to Atlanta’s stellar duo of Julio Jones and Mohammad Sanu, the New England Patriots’ core of wide receivers can mean the difference in another championship banner or empty-handed defeat approaching this year’s much anticipated Super Bowl matchup.</p>\n<p>Operating under Offensive Coordinator Josh McDaniel and his slot-schemed offense, the Pats’ spread of receivers Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan and Danny Amendola will be a primary concern for a strong and ball-hawking Falcons’ secondary.</p>\n<p>Eight-year veteran and Super Bowl XLIX hero Julian Edelman is the first impact player Head Coach Dan Quinn and his Falcons must attend to. Epitomized for the big moment and for being Tom Brady’s go-to guy in crunch time, Edelman has been known for thriving under pressure and making big plays when it matters.</p>\n<p>His go-ahead grab that put the Patriots up against the Seahawks in the final minute of Super Bowl XLIX is a prime example as well as his eight receptions for 118 yards and one touchdown in the Patriots 36-17 AFC Championship win over the Steelers this postseason.</p>\n<p>Edelman had a solid regular season as well with 98 receptions, and a career-high 1,109 receiving yards as well as hauling in three touchdowns. The eighth-year receiver is also coming off his best year in the postseason, averaging eight catches and 127 yards per game in his games versus the Texans and Steelers.</p>\n<p>Monmouth product Chris Hogan is also another liability on offense for the Falcons. Coming off the game of his career, Hogan has proven to be a target that can catch the deep ball, recording 180 yards and two touchdowns in New England’s match against the Steelers.</p>\n<p>In terms of Atlanta’s defense, the Falcons’ pool of cornerbacks will match up well and pose a big test on New England’s athletic receivers. Corners Robert Alford, Jalen Collins and Brian Poole play an integral part in Atlanta’s coverage scheme. They are able to make the sure tackle and jam up their opponent combining for 28 total tackles and five pass deflections this postseason.</p>\n<p>Safeties Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen serve as the stronghold for the Falcons’ secondary. Neal’s 17 postseason tackles and Allen’s two interceptions lead the team.<br>\nOverall, this matchup between the Patriots’ receivers and Falcons serves as an enticing pair that everyone should keep their eyes on.</p>\n<p><strong>Pats Secondary vs. Falcons WRs by Tommy Pardini</strong></p>\n<p>An integral part of the high-powered Atlanta Falcons offense is their solid receiving core led by All-Pro receiver Julio Jones, who is consistently in the conversation for the top wide receiver in the NFL.</p>\n<p>The Falcons’ passing attack through Jones has been killing teams all year long. Just ask the Green Bay Packers, who surrendered 180 receiving yards and two touchdowns to the 6’3” 220-pound beast in the NFC title game.</p>\n<p>Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan loves to move players around in different spots on the field. For example, Jones or receiver Taylor Gabriel will frequently line up out wide by either sideline or in the slot depending on the play.</p>\n<p>This means the defensive unit on the other side of the ball needs to be versatile and intelligent, traits that many New England Patriot players possess.</p>\n<p>The secondary for the Patriots is comprised of Super Bowl veterans like cornerback Malcolm Butler and safeties Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung, who have both played in two Super Bowls. McCourty converted from cornerback to safety a few years back, which is evident with his versatile ability to line up with receivers when need be.</p>\n<p>The New England coaching staff seems to always put their players in positions to succeed. Under Head Coach Bill Belichick, while playing in the postseason, the Patriots have only allowed one playoff touchdown to any first-team All-Pro receiver standing 6 feet or taller (Julio Jones), with the average stat line consisting of about five catches and 62 receiving yards as reported on NESN.com. This includes 19 players’ playoff games from only their All-Pro caliber seasons.</p>\n<p>Over this entire year, Julio Jones is averaging 3.2 yards per route run, which is tops in the NFL by nearly half a yard per ProFootballFocus.com. The versatile Patriots’ secondary will undoubtedly have their hands full. Atlanta’s receiving unit has been tough to handle this season because they come at you in so many ways.</p>\n<p>This fascinating matchup could be a big deciding factor in Super Bowl LI. A great performance from Jones and the rest of the Falcons receivers could give Atlanta their first ever Lombardi Trophy. The reverse would give Brady and Belichick the most Super Bowl victories by a quarterback-coach duo in NFL history.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<p><strong>Pats Special Teams vs. Falcons Special Teams by Spencer Ault</strong></p>\n<p>Heading into this Sunday’s Super Bowl, there’s been a lot of debate about Bill Belichick versus Matt Ryan and Tom Brady versus Vic Beasley Jr. Yet there hasn’t been a whole lot of debate about special teams.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<p>That’s understandable; special teams often receive sort of a “redheaded stepchild” treatment when it comes to sports arguments. Just because it’s understandable, however, doesn’t make that lack of debate any less of a shame.</p>\n<p>Most years, New England’s high ranking would lean heavily on their kicker, four-time Pro Bowler Stephen Gostkowski.</p>\n<p>The 11-year veteran has succeeded for most of his career but experienced early-season struggles during the regular season. He ended with three missed extra points and four missed field goals to accumulate an 84.4 field goal percentage — the lowest in his career since 2012 — making Gostkowski less reliable than usual.</p>\n<p>Matt Bryant, on the other hand, has been nothing but reliable for the Falcons this year. Bryant had the best season of his 15-season career, going 34-37 on field goals and 56-57 on extra points. Simply put, if this game comes down to kicking, Atlanta’s got the edge.</p>\n<p>Kick coverage, on the other hand, is an easy decision.</p>\n<p>The Falcons are one of the worst teams in the league in both kickoff and punt coverage, while the Patriots — led by Matthew Slater and Nate Ebner — keep returners pretty much silent.</p>\n<p>New England’s strong kick coverage will be a crucial key in hindering the high-octane Atlanta offense, while the Falcons might have some trouble keeping the Patriots from enjoying consistently good field position.</p>\n<p>In the end, the pivotal point between these two special teams is the return game. New England has struggled to find consistency with its returners and has been plagued by fumbles.</p>\n<p>Dion Lewis remains a threat in the Patriots’ return game in which he showcased his ability with a 98-yard kickoff return touchdown in the Patriots Divisional Round win over the Houston Texans.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Eric Weems holds things down for the Falcons and provides them with an ideal arrangement. Currently, in his 10th year, the veteran return specialist is sixth in the league in punt return average amongst qualified players and was the team’s leading returner during the regular season with 391 yards on 17 returns.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Falcons seem to have the special teams advantage, thanks to Stephen Gostkowski’s inconsistency and Eric Weems’s consistency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A
