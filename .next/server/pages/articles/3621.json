The state assemblyman co-authored a bill allowing courts to issue gun violence restraining orders. According to Williams, the bill was written to address “a gap in the law.” Kenneth Song/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Two laws introduced by state legislators from the Santa Barbara area following last spring’s murder spree in Isla Vista, which took the lives of six UCSB students, were approved by Governor Jerry Brown this past Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The approved laws are AB 1014, which allows a judge to issue a temporary, emergency restraining order to briefly prohibit an individual’s access to firearms if they are judged to be dangerous, and SB 505, which requires local law enforcement agencies to implement written policies to encourage officers to consult the Department of Justice Automated Firearms System to determine whether a person subject to a welfare check is the registered owner of a firearm. The authors of the newly approved laws and other public officials gathered at Anisq’oyo’ Park in I.V. yesterday for a press conference on the law’s approval.</p>\n<p>State assemblyman for Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and AB 1014 co-author Das Williams stated that the governor’s approval of the gun violence restraining order is a “huge victory” that empowers law enforcement and family members to take steps to protect themselves.</p>\n<p>Williams also said in a separate press conference that he was inspired to author the bill to address a “gap in the law” that became evident following the events of May 23.</p>\n<p>“As I learned more about the details of this incident and that the family of the perpetrator of this violence had made an effort to alert law enforcement to possible danger, it became clear the system wasn’t set up, directly, to protect us as a community,” Williams said at the press conference yesterday. “In the future, it will be a tool for concerned family members, friends and law enforcement to deal with troubled individuals.”</p>\n<p>AB 1014, which goes into full effect Jan. 1, 2016, authorizes a given court to issue a maximum 21-day “gun violence restraining order” prohibiting the subject of the order from owning or having any access to firearms or ammunition. The issuance of such an order is contingent upon the court’s determination that the subject of the order poses a threat to themselves or others by having access to firearms.</p>\n<p>The law states that gun violence restraining orders can be requested by both an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer. The bill also requires an additional court hearing to be held within the 21-day period to determine whether a year-long order prohibiting firearm access should be issued. Additional year-long orders can also be issued at the court’s discretion.</p>\n<p>Williams also said in a separate interview that roommates would be able to make a request for the order because under California law anyone living with someone for a minimum of six months also qualifies as immediate family.</p>\n<p>The issuance of a gun violence restraining order would also require that the subject of the order surrender all firearms in their possession. Under current laws, sheriff’s deputies can ask the subject of a welfare check to voluntarily surrender firearms, but cannot seize weapons simply during welfare calls, according to Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Kelly Hoover.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office can only hold firearms if it determined there is a danger to the individual or the public.  A check the welfare call does not alone permit the Sheriff’s Office to seize weapons,” Hoover said in a prior interview.  “Depending on the circumstances, the Sheriff’s Office could hold weapons seized for a period of time up till approximately 180 days, but typically 60-to-90 days.”</p>\n<p>Williams also said he thought the “most important thing” when it comes to addressing existing gun laws is to get Congress to act.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to pass some very good gun laws here,” Williams said in a separate interview. “But at a national level nothing has been done. Sandy Hook, Colorado, our tragedy in Isla Vista, all of this has happened, and while it’s changed the politics of Sacramento it hasn’t changed the politics in Washington at all … so people are gonna have to get angry and demand that change.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Jennifer Suh and friend of Christopher Michaels-Martinez was present at yesterday’s press conference and said she believed the bill’s approval is a start to making a difference.</p>\n<p>“Even if it doesn’t make a huge dent in the problem, even if it doesn’t make a huge difference in the bigger issue, I think it’s a start,” Suh said.</p>\n<p>In late August, the families of slain UCSB students Christopher Michaels-Martinez, Veronika Weiss and Katie Cooper wrote a letter to Brown urging him to approve the legislation and emphasized that if a gun violence restraining order had been possible prior to the shooting, lives could have been saved.</p>\n<p>“Nothing we can do will bring back Christopher, but I’m confident this new law will help save lives and prevent other families from experiencing this same kind of tragedy. States around the country should be exploring this life-saving measure,” Richard Martinez said in a statement following the law’s approval.</p>\n<p>SB 505 author and State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara, said the governor’s approval of SB 505 would better equip law enforcement during welfare calls.</p>\n<p>“This bill will help ensure that law enforcement agencies are using all the tools available to them to gather potentially life-saving information for themselves and others,” Jackson said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Three weeks prior to the Isla Vista shooting, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s deputies contacted assailant Elliot Rodger as a part of a welfare check at his parent’s request, but did not know he possessed any firearms and cleared the call. Under the new law, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office will now be required to develop policies to encourage officers to consult the Department of Justice’s Automated Firearms Database prior to conducting a welfare check.</p>\n<p>Welfare calls are fairly commonplace, but consulting the Automated Firearms System prior to taking a call is not standard procedure and would only occur if deputies felt the individual in question posed a threat to themselves or others, Hoover said in a prior interview.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56357\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA campus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> two days earlier, helps distinguish this search for a new president as being the first in which the Regents Committee have created space for public input.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the UCR speakers raised similar issues as those at UCLA, including advocacy for undocumented students and the need for climate change action, many statements addressed challenges facing the campus specifically. In particular, town hall attendees discussed difficulty the campus has had in meeting its goals of increasing student enrollment while also continuing to provide a quality and affordable education to its current student body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These inequities were recognized by many individuals present, including Robin Russin, a professor in the Department of Theatre, Film, and Digital Production at UCR. Russin expressed his frustration with the lack of funding given to the university to meet this challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need money; we need resources. We cannot grow without them,” Rossin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are already in a highly impacted situation … this idea of growing to 35,000 students [by 2035] is simply not real. It can’t happen. We’re already overstressed unless we’re given the resources for new faculty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christopher Chase-Dunn, a sociology professor at UCR, expressed bewilderment at the campus goal of expanding resources to accommodate 10,000 extra students within the next 15 years. He emphasized the ongoing challenges in addressing the already-expanding undergraduate student body with a limited amount of resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chase-Dunn, many faculty members remain “very concerned” about this issue since there does not seem to be a plan for sustainable growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we just expand and take care of all of the poor kids in California and solve the problem for the rest ofrestall the other campuses, we’re gonna be diplomable, doing online courses and handing out things, but it won’t really be an institution that meets the stands of the University of California system,” he stated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The plan is to expand the campus hugely over the next few years, and we’re very concerned because apparently there’s no agreement on how we’re going to have enough resources in order to do that,” Chase-Dunn said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the students and faculty at UCR also condemned the current lack of resources and the fact that classes are held in old buildings with various utility issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Assistant Vice Chancellor and Campus Architect Jaqueline Norman, many of the buildings on campus were built during the early 1900s and during the 1950s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of these buildings have not had any significant renovation or improvements since their original construction,” Norman said. “Supporting contemporary learning and cutting-edge research in aging buildings with often failing infrastructure is a daily institutional challenge.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many also expressed their frustrations regarding a perceived status bias and disparity in funding allocations — </span><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2012/06/10/rebenching_budget_model_to_evenly_allocate_state_funds_per_student_to_each_uc_campus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a 2012 report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, showed an allocation of $398 million at UCLA, versus $154 million given to UCR and $117 million to UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are the lowest core-funded campus in the UC, heavily reliant on state funds, tuition and fees,” Jennifer Brown, a professor of public policy, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we need is a president … who will reverse the structural inequities which have existed across the system. As a woefully underfunded campus, UCR has fewer resources for our current students than other UC campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She pointed to figures obtained from UCR Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox’s office, which showed that UCLA receives $11,444 per student, while UCR receives $8,447 per student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We understand that there are weighted algorithms involved in this, but we still believe that this is an instance of institutional racism,” Brown said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She attributed this to the composition of UCR’s </span><a href=\"https://www.ucr.edu/about/ranks-and-facts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student body</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has a higher proportion of minority students compared to other campuses in the UC system on average. The student body, of which 86.6% identifies as a minority, has a higher overall ethnic diversity than </span><a href=\"http://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"https://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. More Pell Grant students are enrolled at UCR than at all of the Ivy League universities combined, and nearly 60% of the student body is made up of first-generation college attendees, according to data from the official </span><a href=\"https://www.ucr.edu/about/ranks-and-facts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCR website.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Therefore, we ask that the next president commit to funding UCR on a proportional basis equivalent to other campuses and erase the structural inequalities which are deeply eroding the quality of access at UCR,” Brown said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students also associated lack of funding as being especially harmful to minority or underrepresented groups, often drawing from their own personal experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silvia Ferrer, a DACA recipient at the university, spoke about navigating the legal difficulties associated with her immigration status.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferrera cited university support groups as critical in supporting her academic endeavors, but also described these programs as being “substantially underfunded,” which she said came as no surprise in light of the campus’s status as the lowest core-funded campus in the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent Rasso, director of government relations for Associated Students at UCR, said that the next UC president must work to help students facing urgent housing and food insecurities, issues which he attributed to being more pervasive at UCR among Black and Hispanic students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next UC president must be a strong ally to students by working diligently within university and legislative governance to uplift the voices of  students,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public commentary for the next UC president can be submitted to the Regents through email or postal mail, with the addresses on the Search Committee </span><a href=\"https://presidentialsearch.universityofcalifornia.edu/public-input.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec21eb515a0882fb7b969b6d32fa5b66?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec21eb515a0882fb7b969b6d32fa5b66?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/heather-carr/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Heather Carr</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Heather Carr is an Opinion and News staff writer.

legislature in June. </span><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2020-21/pdf/BudgetSummary/HigherEducation.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which allocates $36 billion for higher education across the state, offers a 5% increase in “base” resources for UC campuses, as well as funding for several specific programs on UC campuses, including the expansion of the UC Riverside School of Medicine, UC San Francisco School of Medicine and the UC San Diego Center for Public Preparedness Multi-Campus Research Initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an important step toward covering the funds necessary to meet UC’s tripartite mission of delivering world-class education, conducting cutting-edge research and providing public service that benefits California and beyond,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Board of Regents Chair John Pérez and UC President Janet Napolitano said in a joint statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to ongoing funding, the budget aims to help students who require immigration legal services to defend themselves in court, support degree and certificate completion programs at UC extension centers and develop a UC Subject Matter Project in computer science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement by UC Student Association (UCSA) President Varsha Sarveshwar, who “welcomed” the proposed budget, she expressed hope that UCSA could work with legislators “to secure additional investments that reflect UC student priorities: investments in outreach and retention programs, mental health services, and resources for undocumented students, foster youth, and formerly incarcerated students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the budget proposal stated that “these investments are provided with the expectation that UC will continue to focus on maintaining college affordability, increasing student access, improving timely degree completion, and reducing achievement gaps,” it made no explicit mention of the services Sarveshwar detailed in her statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget also detailed expectations for the UC System, but it held no requirements to maintain current tuition rates. The UC has proposed a tuition increase over five years to fund financial aid and other campus needs, with the UC Regents voting on the increase Jan. 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarveshwar stated that “UCSA also hopes to work with the Governor’s office and members of the legislature to secure the funding necessary to avoid a tuition increase.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s proposed budget took into account the “significant growth” of the UCs in the past few years, and this year’s budget increase seems intended to do the same, as the proposal states that its 10 campuses now enroll more than 280,000 students, as opposed to far smaller numbers merely a decade ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newsom’s budget will not go into effect until it is voted on by the state legislature in June. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-64057\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students held a rally on Nov. 20, 2014 against proposed tuition hikes by the University of California Board of Regents, which called for an annual 5 percent increase in tuition over the next five years due to a lack of state funding for the UC. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 150 students from several UC campuses gathered outside the UC Regents meeting Thursday in protest of a proposed tuition hike, forcing the Regents to table its approval until January.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents proposed a $280 annual tuition increase for UC students in order to fund more resources for the rising number of students attending UCs. Ralph Washington Jr., UC Davis UC Student Association President, and Erica Perez, UC Riverside Campus Action chair, planned a protest upon hearing of the increase.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Washington said the protest was successful in its goal to “bring attention to student perspective,” but the Regents’ decision will be unknown until the meeting in January.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest began at 8 a.m. with protestors gathered outside the building and chanting at the Regents as they entered. Protesters employed four basic tactics: a banner drop, human chain, spelling out S.O.S. and camping in tents outside the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure students are comfortable at all levels,” Erica Perez said. “Not everyone can come out to say what we do; we’re out there for those that can’t be there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure the wellbeing of students, a “wellness leader” handed out water and snacks to protesters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tensions increased during the meeting when Regents attempted to cut it short, much to the dismay of any protesters who had bussed overnight to attend the meeting. Regent John Perez suggested holding another open comment period to hear student concerns, but was denied.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Things could have easily been smoother if they allowed the students to make a public comment,” Erica Perez said. “They constantly make decisions for us; we need to be included in these conversations all the time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The hope is that we adopt a conversation,” Washington said. “Many students face basic needs insecurity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Food Security and Access Study conducted by the Regents found nearly 20 percent of students face food insecurity, with 42 percent of students in the UC system reporting they had experienced a decrease in quality or intake of food in the last 12 months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a conspicuous problem,” Washington said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have to either think about buying food or paying tuition,” Erica Perez said. “We should not be thinking about sacrificing things to get a higher education … our needs as students aren’t being met, and that’s what frustrates us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erica Perez and Washington both emphasized the importance of protesting to express student beliefs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I definitely believe that protests can have an affect on a political agenda, and sometimes this is what our education looks like,” Erica Perez said. “Organizing gives you a voice; protests are able to give you a voice where you can express yourself the way you want to.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest has been in the planning stages for two months, with weekly conference calls involving several students across the UC. Students discussed logistics and tactics to increase students’ comfort and efficiency as protestors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that’s beautiful, just to see that students are taking the time,” Erica Perez said in reference to the long meetings. “We don’t see it as work because, when you organize, it’s the passion, it’s something you love to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite Regents tabling the discussion on tuition hikes, the UCSB Student Activist Network will be holding a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-18/walkout-to-defy-possible-uc-tuition-hikes/\" target=\"_blank\"> walkout on Monday </a>to make a statement that tabling the discussion is not enough, and that students want a rollback on tuition prices. Students across the UC system will leave their classes, and students at UCSB will gather under Storke Tower to express their disapproval.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: The photo caption incorrectly said the protest was in 2015, not 2014. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
