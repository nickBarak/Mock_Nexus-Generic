            <h2>Conditions Have Worsened, Frustration is Rising. Will the Administration Step Up?</h2>
<p>It’s been nearly six months since former Special Forces soldier and current UCSB biology student Paul Malone embarked on his most recent mission to improve and expand the limited services offered to veterans on campus. His plight has been an uphill battle.</p>
<p>As president of the Student Veteran Organization, Malone assists veterans in their transition from soldier to student and addresses the various issues facing the student veteran community, which is armed with meager resources. While university administration has promised forthcoming improvements, Malone said he has seen a stark contrast between what has been promised and what has been delivered.</p>
<p>The challenges facing veterans were worsened when Jon Parra, a 20-year veteran of the military and the director of the independently funded Veteran Resource Team, resigned at the end of March. Malone attempted to explain some of the causes behind Parra’s departure, which eliminated UCSB’s last full-time staff position devoted entirely to veterans.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t finding himself effective here, and the infrastructure, I suppose, isn’t in place for him to do the things that need to be done for him to start and maintain a successful veterans program,” Malone said. “Now there is no one dedicated full-time to veterans as there used to be.”</p>
<p>Frustration at UCSB’s climate for veterans is not an isolated phenomenon. Ph.D. student and naval veteran Delores Mondragon described her experiences at UCSB as “intolerable” and said she “faced assault and harassment for being a veteran.”</p>
<p>Here at UCSB, Mondragon studies Military Sexual Trauma, a term that references experiences of sexual assault or harassment in the military, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder, a debilitating anxiety disorder that follows an experience or witness of a terrifying, traumatic or tragic event, as defined by the American Psychology Association. When she reported an incident of being attacked and threatened, however, her fellow students mocked her, implying that her report was merely indication that she suffered from the very disorder she studied. Even when she approached the Title IX office at UCSB, she did not receive much consolation.</p>
<p>“It was hinted by fellow students that my reporting of harassment was a condition of me possibly suffering from PTSD. I reported the incident to Title IX and they could not do anything even though I was grabbed, cussed at and threatened with future retaliation,” Mondragon said. “But this was seen as an exaggeration, and when I reported it to the dean, I was ostracized because I took it outside of the department — I was told things get handled in-house.”</p>
<p>Mondragon said she was only seeking the most basic level of courtesy and equal treatment for veterans.</p>
<p>“We just want to be treated as human beings,” she said.</p>
<p>This past week, the issue reached a critical point when Malone and another student veteran, Aaron Barruga, personally delivered a detailed and extensive list of grievances from the veteran community to the office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The letter described “cultural, administrative and resource failures that have hampered the integration and success of our student veterans,” and outlined specific action that the university should take to correct these failures.</p>
<p>The recommended actions included implementing a digital tracking and record-keeping system for enrolled student veterans, hiring a new, full-time Coordinator of Veteran and Military Services and establishing mandatory veteran awareness training for faculty and staff, which is similar to training provided for awareness of other minority groups.</p>
<p>The most urgent element of the letter regarded the appalling national rate of veteran suicide, which stands at about 22 people every day, according to the Department of Veteran Affairs. In other words, a veteran takes his or her own life every 65 minutes.</p>
<p>Barruga, a former member of the military’s elite Joint Special Operations Command and current first-year economics major, explained the potentially deadly risks that are associated with not providing proper resources to “an entire demographic of students who are predisposed to testing positive” for PTSD.</p>
<p>“It’s such a pertinent issue because, if we were a Filipino culture club or whatever, the end state may be limited to, say, [the fact that] people would not appreciate our culture the way we wanted them to,” Barruga said. “Our end state is [that] a veteran is not going to feel socially accepted because he has PTSD. The culture here is going to unconsciously create distress for him and he’s going to go home and blow his fucking brains out. So our end state is very costly if we choose not to act.”</p>
<p>Clinical psychologist Kirsten Olson said it is essential for the university to provide additional services to student veterans, who she said are considered “non-traditional students” for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>“They are older, they are more likely to have families and they are more likely to have other sorts of problems that our traditional college students don’t have,” Olson said. “They are also more likely to have lots of strengths and life experience that other traditional students don’t have.”</p>
<p>Olson, who specializes in addressing PTSD issues in combat veterans, expressed support for Malone’s continued efforts for improvement, saying “there’s always more that can be done.”</p>
<p>“I think that’s why Paul’s leadership has been so great, because he’s acknowledging, ‘Right, UCSB has done a lot, but there’s more to be done,’” Olson said. “He’s trying to raise that awareness — that these are the next steps that need to be done.”</p>
<p>Malone, members of the administration and the Veteran Resource Team have been working relentlessly to relocate the Veteran Resource Center from its current 10-foot-by-10-foot room to a larger area, specifically Building 434, a structure located near Counseling Services that has remained vacant for over six months for unspecified maintenance reasons. Their efforts finally paid off yesterday, with the university informing veterans that the building would be allocated to them. The new space is, according to Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead, more than twice the size of the current VRC, and could prove more accommodating to the population of more than 100 veterans and 350 veteran dependents on campus that it caters to.</p>
<p>A key concern raised by the letter was the amount of student veterans that have dropped out of UCSB since last year, which the letter stated was a quarter of the total student veteran population. In light of this number, the letter also stated that not enough efforts have been made to service student veterans.</p>
<p>“We have failed to educate, protect, and empower student veterans, as a university,” the letter stated.</p>
<p>With such high drop-out rates, Malone said there is a lack of concern for retaining student vets, which he said would not be such an issue for many other underrepresented students.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of communities where it would be simply unacceptable to lose a quarter of the population — that’s huge,” Malone said.</p>
<p>Armistead disputed the accuracy of the statistic by referring to veterans who delivered “statements of intent to register, but then did not enroll.”</p>
<p>“I believe that there was a misunderstanding on the numbers that the students were working with,” she said.</p>
<p>Even with her disagreement on the figures, Armistead said UCSB still needs to provide more to veterans on campus.</p>
<p>“I do believe that we need to do a better job supporting veteran students,” she said. “The goal is to hire a coordinator that focuses on supporting veterans. I believe this focus will help with improving retention.”</p>
<p>Several instances of potentially offensive and thoughtless language from university faculty was the final grievance expressed in the letter to the chancellor. In one instance mentioned in the letter, a tenured professor said of concerns surrounding student veterans and efforts to assist them, “What’s the worst that could happen? Suicide?”</p>
<p>The remark was made in the presence of a student vet, and Olson said such a statement runs contrary to the accepting and welcoming environment the university is supposed to hold for all students.</p>
<p>“We talk about having a climate of respect on campus and appreciating diversity, having respect for all different points of view,” she said. “But, making derogatory comments or dismissive comments about suicide — that wouldn’t be okay to say … in the Greek community in terms of fraternities or sororities. So why would it be okay to make dismissive comments about the veteran community?”</p>
<p>Additionally, the prevalence of suicide in the vet community is as concerning for vets, and should be treated as delicately, as it would be for any other student community, Olson said.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t say ‘Who cares?’ if a queer person kills themselves, so why is it okay to say ‘Who cares?’ if a veteran kills themselves? It wouldn’t be okay to say that about any of our valued community members.”</p>
<p>Like Olson, Barruga said he found the comments unproductive and careless.</p>
<p>“When you start saying stuff that paints this picture that veterans are damaged goods — they come from lower class, they’re uneducated, just shit like that — it doesn’t help,” Barruga said.</p>
<p>Despite the long list of grievances, Olson provided insight regarding the progress that UCSB administrators have made toward veterans’ issues in the recent past. For example, Olson said Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young has demonstrated consistent support for student veterans. Similarly, Executive Assistant to Chancellor Yang Diane O’Brien said members of the administration have, in fact, been working diligently to improve the state of affairs for veterans.</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to make any excuses. We’ve been working really hard with Student Affairs to help solve some of their issues,” O’Brien said.</p>
<p>Whether administration officials are indeed striving to improve the state of veteran affairs on campus or are engaged in conscious or unconscious negligence, a significant portion of the veteran segment in the student population continues to face a unique set of challenges. Speaking with many of them, it becomes apparent that some are dissatisfied with their treatment and experiences at UCSB. Still, according to Mondragon, they remain “skilled, responsible and prepared,” with a determination to work for a more equal system on behalf of their fellow veterans.</p>

Will the Administration Step Up?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been nearly six months since former Special Forces soldier and current UCSB biology student Paul Malone embarked on his most recent mission to improve and expand the limited services offered to veterans on campus. His plight has been an uphill battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs president of the Student Veteran Organization, Malone assists veterans in their transition from soldier to student and addresses the various issues facing the student veteran community, which is armed with meager resources. While university administration has promised forthcoming improvements, Malone said he has seen a stark contrast between what has been promised and what has been delivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe challenges facing veterans were worsened when Jon Parra, a 20-year veteran of the military and the director of the independently funded Veteran Resource Team, resigned at the end of March. Malone attempted to explain some of the causes behind Parra’s departure, which eliminated UCSB’s last full-time staff position devoted entirely to veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wasn’t finding himself effective here, and the infrastructure, I suppose, isn’t in place for him to do the things that need to be done for him to start and maintain a successful veterans program,” Malone said. “Now there is no one dedicated full-time to veterans as there used to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustration at UCSB’s climate for veterans is not an isolated phenomenon. Ph.D. student and naval veteran Delores Mondragon described her experiences at UCSB as “intolerable” and said she “faced assault and harassment for being a veteran.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere at UCSB, Mondragon studies Military Sexual Trauma, a term that references experiences of sexual assault or harassment in the military, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder, a debilitating anxiety disorder that follows an experience or witness of a terrifying, traumatic or tragic event, as defined by the American Psychology Association. When she reported an incident of being attacked and threatened, however, her fellow students mocked her, implying that her report was merely indication that she suffered from the very disorder she studied. Even when she approached the Title IX office at UCSB, she did not receive much consolation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was hinted by fellow students that my reporting of harassment was a condition of me possibly suffering from PTSD. I reported the incident to Title IX and they could not do anything even though I was grabbed, cussed at and threatened with future retaliation,” Mondragon said. “But this was seen as an exaggeration, and when I reported it to the dean, I was ostracized because I took it outside of the department — I was told things get handled in-house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMondragon said she was only seeking the most basic level of courtesy and equal treatment for veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We just want to be treated as human beings,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis past week, the issue reached a critical point when Malone and another student veteran, Aaron Barruga, personally delivered a detailed and extensive list of grievances from the veteran community to the office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The letter described “cultural, administrative and resource failures that have hampered the integration and success of our student veterans,” and outlined specific action that the university should take to correct these failures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recommended actions included implementing a digital tracking and record-keeping system for enrolled student veterans, hiring a new, full-time Coordinator of Veteran and Military Services and establishing mandatory veteran awareness training for faculty and staff, which is similar to training provided for awareness of other minority groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most urgent element of the letter regarded the appalling national rate of veteran suicide, which stands at about 22 people every day, according to the Department of Veteran Affairs. In other words, a veteran takes his or her own life every 65 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarruga, a former member of the military’s elite Joint Special Operations Command and current first-year economics major, explained the potentially deadly risks that are associated with not providing proper resources to “an entire demographic of students who are predisposed to testing positive” for PTSD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s such a pertinent issue because, if we were a Filipino culture club or whatever, the end state may be limited to, say, [the fact that] people would not appreciate our culture the way we wanted them to,” Barruga said. “Our end state is [that] a veteran is not going to feel socially accepted because he has PTSD. The culture here is going to unconsciously create distress for him and he’s going to go home and blow his fucking brains out. So our end state is very costly if we choose not to act.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClinical psychologist Kirsten Olson said it is essential for the university to provide additional services to student veterans, who she said are considered “non-traditional students” for a number of reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are older, they are more likely to have families and they are more likely to have other sorts of problems that our traditional college students don’t have,” Olson said. “They are also more likely to have lots of strengths and life experience that other traditional students don’t have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlson, who specializes in addressing PTSD issues in combat veterans, expressed support for Malone’s continued efforts for improvement, saying “there’s always more that can be done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that’s why Paul’s leadership has been so great, because he’s acknowledging, ‘Right, UCSB has done a lot, but there’s more to be done,’” Olson said. “He’s trying to raise that awareness — that these are the next steps that need to be done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone, members of the administration and the Veteran Resource Team have been working relentlessly to relocate the Veteran Resource Center from its current 10-foot-by-10-foot room to a larger area, specifically Building 434, a structure located near Counseling Services that has remained vacant for over six months for unspecified maintenance reasons. Their efforts finally paid off yesterday, with the university informing veterans that the building would be allocated to them. The new space is, according to Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead, more than twice the size of the current VRC, and could prove more accommodating to the population of more than 100 veterans and 350 veteran dependents on campus that it caters to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key concern raised by the letter was the amount of student veterans that have dropped out of UCSB since last year, which the letter stated was a quarter of the total student veteran population. In light of this number, the letter also stated that not enough efforts have been made to service student veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have failed to educate, protect, and empower student veterans, as a university,” the letter stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith such high drop-out rates, Malone said there is a lack of concern for retaining student vets, which he said would not be such an issue for many other underrepresented students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are a lot of communities where it would be simply unacceptable to lose a quarter of the population — that’s huge,” Malone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmistead disputed the accuracy of the statistic by referring to veterans who delivered “statements of intent to register, but then did not enroll.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe that there was a misunderstanding on the numbers that the students were working with,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with her disagreement on the figures, Armistead said UCSB still needs to provide more to veterans on campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do believe that we need to do a better job supporting veteran students,” she said. “The goal is to hire a coordinator that focuses on supporting veterans. I believe this focus will help with improving retention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral instances of potentially offensive and thoughtless language from university faculty was the final grievance expressed in the letter to the chancellor. In one instance mentioned in the letter, a tenured professor said of concerns surrounding student veterans and efforts to assist them, “What’s the worst that could happen? Suicide?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remark was made in the presence of a student vet, and Olson said such a statement runs contrary to the accepting and welcoming environment the university is supposed to hold for all students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We talk about having a climate of respect on campus and appreciating diversity, having respect for all different points of view,” she said. “But, making derogatory comments or dismissive comments about suicide — that wouldn’t be okay to say … in the Greek community in terms of fraternities or sororities. So why would it be okay to make dismissive comments about the veteran community?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, the prevalence of suicide in the vet community is as concerning for vets, and should be treated as delicately, as it would be for any other student community, Olson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t say ‘Who cares?’ if a queer person kills themselves, so why is it okay to say ‘Who cares?’ if a veteran kills themselves? It wouldn’t be okay to say that about any of our valued community members.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Olson, Barruga said he found the comments unproductive and careless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you start saying stuff that paints this picture that veterans are damaged goods — they come from lower class, they’re uneducated, just shit like that — it doesn’t help,” Barruga said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the long list of grievances, Olson provided insight regarding the progress that UCSB administrators have made toward veterans’ issues in the recent past. For example, Olson said Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young has demonstrated consistent support for student veterans. Similarly, Executive Assistant to Chancellor Yang Diane O’Brien said members of the administration have, in fact, been working diligently to improve the state of affairs for veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not trying to make any excuses. We’ve been working really hard with Student Affairs to help solve some of their issues,” O’Brien said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether administration officials are indeed striving to improve the state of veteran affairs on campus or are engaged in conscious or unconscious negligence, a significant portion of the veteran segment in the student population continues to face a unique set of challenges. Speaking with many of them, it becomes apparent that some are dissatisfied with their treatment and experiences at UCSB. Still, according to Mondragon, they remain “skilled, responsible and prepared,” with a determination to work for a more equal system on behalf of their fellow veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\"\u003eThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"gallery-54777-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/Veteran.jpg?fit=520%2C300\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54804\",\"title\":\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0079-e1397118822601.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54782\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0109.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54783\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0144-e1397118837242.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54784\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0176-e1397118853627.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54785\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0240-e1397118874744.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54786\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMGP0553-e1397118980749.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54787\",\"title\":\"IMGP0553\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/Picture-005-e1397118999361.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54788\",\"title\":\"Picture 005\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/Picture-135-e1397119012143.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54789\",\"title\":\"Picture 135\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/SANY0320-e1397119026534.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54790\",\"title\":\"SANYO DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhotos Courtesy of Paul Malone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA version of this article appeared in the Thursday, April 10 edition of the Daily Nexus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Those who reside on Del Playa (pictured above) get the added benefit of an ocean view. Daily Nexus File Photo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith ‘For Rent’ signs slapped on almost every house or apartment in Isla Vista, thousands of students are now joining the annual housing rush that begins around the end of every Fall Quarter and beginning of every Winter. During this time, a swarm of UCSB students phone landlords, knock on doors and scramble to fill out paperwork to claim anything from a dream house on the ocean side of Del Playa Drive to a cozy little apartment on Picasso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UCSB Admissions Office reveals statistics that show 52 percent of UCSB students reside in off-campus, non-university owned housing located in I.V., Goleta or Santa Barbara. With the sheer amount of fellow house-hunting competitors, students have been known to rush through house-securing procedures and eventually pay a hefty price for lease agreements that are signed too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Jennifer Ja Birchim, spokesperson from the UCSB Community Housing Office, students facing housing troubles are met with these obstacles only once they actually begin living in their reserved apartments or houses. Such problems include complaints about management, dissatisfaction over rent prices, lack of understanding for the terms written on the lease contract and issues with rushed roommate pairings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Slow down,” Ja Birchim said. “There’s this buzz that happens come October, this panic that they need to find housing. We’re really trying to slow them down and educate them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, Ja Birchim suggests students take a look at the Community Housing Office’s education programs, such as a Rental Fair which is taking place today at the Arbor, where representatives of a variety of housing managements in I.V. will be located to interact with students still seeking out available rental spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are having these educational programs to really walk students through the process so that they go in with their eyes wide open about housing options, living in the community and what that looks like,” Ja Birchim said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI.V. Living: “Not Always Rainbows and Butterflies…”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with these resources, a number of students struggle with their housing decisions. Notorious I.V. apartment living concerns range from safety issues to parking problems. For third-year psychology major Emily Lofthouse, one of the biggest quips about renting involves the infamously inflated rental prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I.V. is the place that most students want to and do live in, and landlords know that, so housing can be really expensive,” Lofthouse said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharing a one-bedroom apartment can range from $600-$800 per student per month, while a house on DP holding about seven to eight people can be close to $4,000-$8,000 total per month. Like Lofthouse, second-year chemical engineering major Scott Lynn said the financial weight of I.V. housing can leave an ugly dent in a renter’s checkbook, but this monetary burden is also passed along to the non-student residents of I.V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The thing about I.V. is that it is near the beach and is close to campus, so that means there is high demand not only from college students, but also from other families in the area who have children in the schools around here,” Lynn said. “It sucks that both of those parties have to pay such high prices, especially since the families in the area tend to be of lower income.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Lynn understands the reasoning behind the high prices, he sometimes feels uncomfortable that the money he currently pays could potentially afford a much better house in another area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My apartment is worth the price, for the area at least. I know in other college towns, like Davis, the price I’m paying for my apartment would rent a house twice as big,” Lynn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with prices, Lofthouse said she also marks noise as a pressing concern on her list of I.V. housing cons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called the cops on my neighbors once because they were screaming, running up and down the side of the house during midterms. I had no idea what they were doing and why they were doing it,” Lofthouse said. “The cops came and told them to shut up, but they didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith UCSB ranked the #2 ‘Party School’ in the nation by the Princeton Review back in August, the noise comes as no shocker for many. Second-year economics and environmental science double major Antonia Tran said she views noise as a minor problem in comparison to the security and crime concerns in I.V. — such as theft, assaults and stabbings — which can oftentimes be committed by (predictably) drunk residents. However, Tran said, with I.V. only about two square miles wide, such rowdiness is unavoidable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Living here is definitely a blessing along with a curse, because with so many young people who also happen to party often together, a lot of belligerence and carelessness is bound to happen: unwelcome guests, unsolicited attention, too much noise and disorderly conduct,” Tran said. “These are just to name a few when you live in a very heavily college-based community in such a small area.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApartments vs. Dorms\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the barrage of downfalls to living the I.V. life, third-year economics and accounting major Michelle Cho, who currently lives on the 6500 block of DP’s vibrant ocean side, said I.V. offers freshmen or transfer students residing in the residence halls an opportunity to smoothly transition into independent living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCho admits, however, that renting a house in I.V. is in no way “easier” than university housing options. While UCSB Housing \u0026amp; Residential Services offer their residents internet access, a live-in staff and 24-hour on-call maintenance, amongst other services, renters in I.V. must be responsible for their own house cleaning, cooking and bill paying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen come the fees. According to UCSB Housing \u0026amp; Residential Services, a standard double room with a 14-meal plan costs $14,211 for the entire 2013-14 school year, with a single costing a little more at $15,711 and a triple at $11,411. Prices fluctuate on whether residence hall students choose to book a 10-meal, 17-meal or unlimited meal plan. In comparison, a single individual’s full-year lease of an apartment in I.V. — keeping in mind that this means renting for 12 months while the residence hall rooms are “rented” for a little less than nine — oftentimes turns out cheaper, with prices paid per person ranging anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000. However, costs of utilities and weekly food supplies must be taken into account, and many of the higher-paying renters find themselves balancing out the prices with those offered by UCSB’s residence halls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Cho, however, as long as students stay smart about house-hunting and are aware and comfortable with their fee payments, renting in I.V. becomes an invaluable tool to help students learn crucial skills such as cooking and paying bills. Cho said I.V. living is part of a period of trial and error that can help students gauge what sort of living environment is right for them in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s so much freedom. We live on our own and we can follow our own rules, given they also follow the restrictions on our lease. With that comes a lot of independence,” Cho said. “Having your own place kind of forces you to grow up and take responsibility.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoosing housing in I.V. does not necessarily mean students must go through independent management companies, however. UCSB provides university-owned apartments at El Dorado, Santa Ynez, Westgate and Westwinds as well as graduate apartments at the San Clemente Villages and family student apartments on Storke Road and at the west end of campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause dorms were overbooked, second-year electrical engineering major Han Chou was offered space in the San Clemente apartments with a few other friends. Chou said all residents at San Clemente receive a single and interact with each other less than would dorm residents. However, he said the people at San Clemente appear more independent and the environment at the apartments are much more conducive for studying purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Having my own room really helped me during testing weeks and keeping my privacy,” Chou said. “There really isn’t much to complain about other than occasional ant problems.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWords from the Landlords\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some managements are more involved with their tenants and strive to build pleasant and professional rapport, others never speak or respond to their tenants and only see them twice — once for lease signing and once again for key turn-ins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to James Knapp of Koto Group Inc., a fairly new property management with multiple locations dispersed throughout I.V., the toughest challenge Koto Group faces lies in the education of first-time renters on how the whole housing process works. According to Knapp, renters are encouraged to contact the management team at any time via email, phone and text messaging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnapp also said UCSB clientele comes across as more appealing to him and Koto Group since UCSB students are more “friendly, appreciative and easy to work with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Renting to students is great,” Knapp said. “I particularly enjoy working with the I.V. community since they are quick to adopt new technology that we offer, as well as give us interesting ideas about how we can improve our properties and services.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor UCSB alumnus and president of Meridian Group Real Estate Management Robert Kooyman, the realm of I.V. leasing is highly familiar. Having studied real estate and management for 28 years, Kooyman said he advises students to educate themselves about the different management companies and their respective leasing philosophies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some managements are very laissez-faire, ‘hands off.’ We’re never going to talk to you until June when you move out. Here are the keys. You won’t hear from us,’” Kooyman said. “Then, there are some of us who want to try to find the middle road. We want to do an annual inspection, check on you and the property and we want be a resource.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Kooyman, knowing about the various housing options available in I.V. — from building type and size to price and location — will help students make better decisions about their future living situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Become an educated customer,” Kooyman said. “There are lots of choices out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere’s No Place Like I.V.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmidst all the steps and factors involved in the whirlwind of I.V. housing, many students still find their college years spent in the tiny beachside community to be a “once-in-a-lifetime” experience, according to Tran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It truly is an experience that you’re only exposed to once, and this kind of thing doesn’t even happen at all colleges necessarily,” Tran said. “It’s two square miles of all these people that are in your age group going through the same things as you, and for the most part, it’s a very friendly, student-based community.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year economics major Kim Garcia said while she found her freshman year experience in a dorm beneficial as a new UCSB student, living in an apartment in I.V. has improved her levels of self-sufficiency and has not barred her from meeting new people. Like Tran, Garcia said she does not regret her decision one bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My experience in I.V. has been absolutely amazing,” Garcia said. “I have never felt so free in my life.

Two years later, his father — a successful Los Angeles businessman — contracted a life-threatening illness but ended up taking his own life before the illness could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his life forever shaken by suicide, DeMarco has struggled as a victim of bullying and childhood schizophrenia in the months and years following his father’s death. Eventually, the thought of killing himself began creeping up on him as well, and the third-year economics major said he began having suicidal thoughts in the earliest years of his adolescence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was made fun of a lot. My life was just going to hell and I thought, ‘This is happening to me at 13, 14 years old. What about when I’m 28 or 35? If I can’t deal with the stress at 14, how am I going to deal with it when I’m 35?’” DeMarco said. “I just thought about killing myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut DeMarco’s story isn’t an isolated one. Two UCSB students committed suicide just last year alone, and UCSB Student Health reports that suicide is the second leading cause of death among college students. A 2011 report by the American College Health Association says roughly seven percent of UCSB students have reported seriously considering suicide, and 16 percent of these students said they felt so depressed that it was difficult to function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe causes behind suicide and the stories behind every life lost to it are not so simple, however. According the National Institute for Mental Health, individual suicides almost always involve a combination of factors such as social isolation, a family history of suicide, incarceration, a history of family violence or exposure to firearms during one’s upbringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, Jill Harkavy-Friedman, vice president of research at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said 90 percent of people who die from suicide have diagnosable and treatable illness such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Therefore, treating these illnesses is an important part of reducing suicide, but the approach must be comprehensive,” Harkavy-Friedman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Harkavy-Friedman, such an approach includes addressing the wide range of factors that influence one’s struggle with suicide, as these can include causes that are environmental or related to mental illness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suicide is a complex behavior that arises out of the coming together of many risk factors, both internal and in the environment,” Harkavy-Friedman said. “Each individual and members of different age groups experience different types of stressors. Nonetheless, mental illnesses in combination with other risk factors are key.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe presence of mental illness is strongly related to genetics, according to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) psychologist Janet Osimo, who said poor mental health can make one especially susceptible to suicidal tendencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you have someone in the family with mental illness, then genetics can make an individual more vulnerable,” Osimo said in an email. “Vulnerability escalates relative to [both] stress in the environment and an individual’s capacity for stress.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2012, the Centers for Disease Control reported that suicide was the third leading cause of death among persons aged 15-24, accounting for 20 percent of all deaths annually within that age group. In light of these statistics, Dr. Victor Schwartz — medical director of Jed Foundation, a non-profit aiming to prevent suicide and promote emotional health of college students — said young people may be slightly more vulnerable to suicide due to the tendency for young people to be more impulsive. Sometimes, Schwartz added, substance abuse can also be a problematic factor in the occurrence of suicide in younger age groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes it is an impulsive act,” Schwartz said. “Sometimes, with younger people, they don’t really appreciate the finality of a mistake, of doing something that’s dangerous to oneself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Schwartz also said being a college student could potentially lower one’s chances of committing suicide, in part due to the relative lack of firearms on college campuses and the support services offered by university health departments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It appears that being in college might be protective or that the cohort of people who are attending college are at a slightly lower risk for suicide than non-college attenders,” Schwartz said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollege students may also be better positioned for good mental health, according to Schwartz, since the experience of reaching higher education is a goal that requires a considerable amount of energy and positivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the sociological front, people have suggested that being in college … you are in a better place sociologically — that you have more hopefulness, you have more connections, you have maybe more of an optimistic sense of the future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, according to Osimo, suicide leaves warning signs. Before carrying out a suicide, Osimo said an individual may reach out and say something to someone they know. They might talk about death, wanting to die or being in unbearable pain, and they may express feeling like a burden to others or display extreme mood swings or other changes in functioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One thing we tell people to look for — if they are trying to figure out if something is going on — is to see if there is a big change in behavior,” Osimo said. “If you can’t remember any of the warning signs, listen to your gut. If you think something is wrong, we don’t need you to know what’s wrong; we don’t need you to diagnose it. You don’t have to fix it: Just get them to someone who can help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen looking out for warning signs, Harkavy-Friedman said people must keep in mind that mental health needs carry great variability amongst different groups of people, particularly for students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At any age, it can take time for individuals to seek help and then, even when one seeks help, the path to wellness may not be direct,” Harkavy-Friedman in an email. “For students, declining grades, social withdrawal, sleep changes, aggression, irritability, impulsiveness and substance use may be red flags.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Debbie Fleming, senior associate dean of Student Life, while the two suicides during the last school year are “extraordinarily rare” occurrences on campus, two is far too many for one year at just one school. In response, UCSB launched the “Say Something” campaign on campus in October of 2013, a suicide prevention outreach effort encouraging students and faculty to seek help or take action if they or someone they know is struggling with thoughts of suicide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe campaign takes a two-pronged approach to addressing suicide on campus. The first is to reach out to students who are themselves struggling with suicide and encourage them to “say something” to someone and get help. Osimo said students should always seek help, even if suicide is not on the forefront of their mind, as she said statistics have shown that people “get better quicker if they come in sooner when distress occurs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot of people feel like they need to wait until something is a crisis to come in for help,” Osimo said in an email. “We are really trying to tell students that it doesn’t need to be a crisis to come in and talk to a counselor. In fact, it’s better to come in earlier. … As they say — come early and often.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the adage, most people who die by suicide have not seen a mental health professional, according to Osimo. Instead, they often wait until things are too serious — maybe even fatal — because they believe they can manage the problem themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second part to the “Say Something” campaign targets the bystander: Friends are encouraged to speak up on behalf of those they perceive are struggling with suicidal thoughts. They are told to take great care when approaching someone about suicidal behavior, such as not panicking and not “minimizing” the situation, according to Osimo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, when friends do reach out, Osimo said they should be careful of certain negative tendencies such as arguing with suicidal individuals about the benefits of living, as she said it is often too late for such reasoning to be effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once somebody gets to that point, in their mind they’ve thought about every avenue. This is really a last resort for them, and they’ve already had that argument with themselves and they have had in their mind a number of failures,” Osimo said. “When you get to that point, it’s almost like you have blinders on: You can only see one solution, and that’s all that is left for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGladys Koscak, a mental health specialist with CAPS, said suicide is less about wanting to die and more about seeking a cessation to one’s pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most people who have attempted suicide don’t actually want to die. They just see it as their only option because they want the pain to end,” Koscak said. “So I think at that point, too, it’s so much less philosophical and moral of an issue than it is about them just really wanting to end the pain that they are feeling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to both Osimo and Koscak, the “Say Something” campaign has attracted positive feedback and a fair amount of support so far. About 27 Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District buses have attached a “#saysomething” hashtag or suicide prevention hotline somewhere on the bus. An Apple and Android smartphone application was also created in light of “Say Something,” with it acting as a tool to help students and faculty receive additional resources and information on suicide prevention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite their success, the program currently faces potential cutbacks. By Feb. 3, CAPS must collect signatures from around 4,000 undergraduate students as well as 400 graduate students in order to put an initiative on the Spring ballot allowing for the continuation of CAPS’s suicide prevention efforts. Osimo said as of Jan. 24, 1,500 signatures have been collected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for students like DeMarco, they were fortunate enough to overcome their struggles on their own. DeMarco said in the end, he simply had to let go of suicide as an “answer” to his problems. But, he advises students who currently have suicidal thoughts to not ignore it and not be afraid to talk. He also said he believes parents play a major part in watching out for their children and should closely observe their child’s behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t ignore the problems — that’s the biggest issue. And if you see bullying, do your best to stop it,” DeMarco said. “Talk to them because suicide is permanent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA version of this story appeared on page 3 of Wednesday, February 5, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53875\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/suicide-awareness-prevention-among-local-university-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53875\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/suicide-awareness-prevention-among-local-university-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/suicide-awareness-prevention-among-local-university-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/suicide-awareness-prevention-among-local-university-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/suicide-awareness-prevention-among-local-university-students/","id":3492,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3491,3490,3489],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/articles/[id]","query":{"id":"3493"},"buildId":"hGi8H6kpJSI3zJ4w_qypv","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-070779da9cfe0fee3499.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-5bb69f7b9fad54285af9.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-488dc228921f1fdbc0e7.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.1049f1295d45532e93be.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.90eb9ff712fbb3a78446.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-938ee2d5eb7b826bfe31.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/6e66614ddad306652b9069d105d24769372aff56.bea5af8d5477addedc77.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/7bede452437e851515b603ef1fcf47e4e2e40b04.cca0e466c0bf1c76ca02.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/articles/%5Bid%5D-9325a72e385002154492.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/hGi8H6kpJSI3zJ4w_qypv/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/hGi8H6kpJSI3zJ4w_qypv/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
