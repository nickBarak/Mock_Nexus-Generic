The Student Advocate General assists students who are charged with violating the University Code of Student Conduct, and students charged of such misconduct are expected to undergo.</p>\n<p>When asked their opinion on the new Conduct Board that aims to judge and potentially punish student groups, both candidates said students should have active involvement in this legal process.</p>\n<p>Third-year history of public policy major Villela said he would make sure to keep a constant presence at the Conduct Board meetings, despite some logistical obstacles to this goal.</p>\n<p>“As far as Conduct Boards, I feel that it is still my space to go and represent these students, so no matter what, I’m still going to be there,” Villela said. “Even though I’m not allowed to say anything, I’m still allowed to ask for time-outs.”</p>\n<p>Whittaker argued that the idea of a conduct board was unfair to students, and said he would fight to gain a greater student voice in this matter.</p>\n<p>“I feel that it’s personally attacking the students on an underhanded level,” Whittaker said. “I have found that most student conduct cases are mistakes — mistakes that most students overlook or just simply forgot … I feel like the Student Advocate General needs a push for an actual say — to actually represent the students in these cases with an actual voice.”</p>\n<p>In regards to past student advocacy efforts, Whittaker said his time on the A.S. Senate and his involvement in creating a group project seeking student input are two experiences that directly qualify him for the position. Whittaker said he plans to change the usual procedures for the position, making a greater effort to assist student defendants.</p>\n<p>“Myself and the four other on-campus legislative council members have definitely felt that our constituents … were not directly represented. However, it was our fault … we were not going to these residence halls as we should have been,” Whittaker said. “Thus we created our group project … we did not wait for them to come to us — we went to them.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Villela mentioned his role in starting Educational Opportunity Program Step Up[[ok]], which raised over $20,000 for the Educational Opportunity Program. Introducing the new program required a sense of initiative that Villela said he would bring to the role of Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>“EOP, as many of you know, are for first-generation students … EOP got hit hard, just as a lot of things on this campus got hit hard, and what happened was — I was a part of a two-week program, and what they were going to do was to cut it down to five days,” Villela said. “So what I did, during my first year along with 10 other people, was to create this program called Step Up.”</p>\n<p>Since the Student Advocate General must regularly resolve student conflicts on a large scale, candidates were also questioned on their ability to come to an effective and fair decision.</p>\n<p>Villela said his time as a Resident Assistant has given him first-hand experience in dealing with a variety of personal conflicts between students, and Villela said he plans to provide students undergoing the university judicial process with a “safe, confidential space.”</p>\n<p>“As a Resident Assistant, I deal with conflicts all the time. We had a very conservative [student], and then we had a student that was a part of the LGBT community, and then a student that was not supportive of that…it was a space for me…to figure out how to best work with each other,” Villela said.</p>\n<p>Whittaker, on the other hand, cited a personal experience when he had had to deal with his own roommate’s misconceptions about his queer identity.</p>\n<p>“In mid-winter, I got a new roommate and I hadn’t met this person before, so they came in and I guess the roommate didn’t know that I was a queer person … I guess that he didn’t feel too comfortable with me and my sexuality,” Whittaker said. “To be honest, a lot of his complications with me were misconceptions about the queer community … so it definitely just came through education, definitely letting him know a lot of the things he believed about queer people were false.”</p>\n<p>When asked how they would maintain truthfulness and accountability within the Office of the Student Advocate General, Villela said that he would be sure to remain nonpartisan and create a Facebook page for the office to reach out to students. Whittaker said he would create an ‘advocacy agenda’ by the fifth week of Fall 2013, which would expand analytical research in the office.</p>\n<p>In their final statements, both candidates stressed their commitment to the student body. Whittaker said he wants to push for more clarified definitions of policies for students, whereas Villela said he would ensure that the Office of Student Advocacy is a safe place for any student who needs it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1822965026\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50949\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50952\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/candidates-discuss-student-conduct-compete-for-advocate-general-position/as-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366215104\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"117\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13 (12)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50952\" alt=\"AS debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13 (12)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12-250x133.jpg?resize=250%2C133\" width=\"250\" height=\"133\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?resize=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>ALEX GONZALES / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6> Student Advocate General candidates debated issues related to judicial affairs on campus yesterday.

Pardall Center — a center at 6550 Pardall that will be funded by student money and will be open to A.S. organizations.</p>\n<p>So far, student officials have not extensively publicized the opening of the space to the general UCSB community, although the center will be entirely funded by student fees. The student government also discussed student support for UC workers, bicycle and skateboard safety and IGNITE, a program that stands for “Invest in Graduations, Not Incarceration. Transform Education.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting Associate Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones introduced recently hired staff member for the A.S. Pardall Center Jeanette Lyden, who will be staffing the first floor of the building from noon to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday for the next several months. He said Lyden will be there to “to provide a more consistent presence,” inviting students in A.S. organizations — known as Boards, Committees or Commissions, or BCCs — to stop by and utilize the space.</p>\n<p>Rent for the space costs $5,000 per month and is currently open to A.S. students and members of BCCs. No concrete plan for funding has been formed, although the center will be paid by student fees regardless. Senator Amir Khazaieli has been working closely with an Ad-Hoc committee to search for which groups will contribute funds to the center over the next two years.</p>\n<p>Jones encouraged students to “utilize and hang out in the space” and to continue to visualize what the space will be used for, recalling a recent instance by which the space was used.</p>\n<p>“Just last night, CAB helped to co-sponsor the event with a frat or sorority or another org … where they had a carnival for youth in Isla Vista, and it was packed,” Jones said. “They had game stations set up all throughout the first floor, food, popcorn, games, it was great.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting, student officials also spoke about the UC workers’ strike earlier in the day, which drew hundreds of participants campus wide.</p>\n<p>Senator John Soriano spoke on behalf of UC service and patient care workers, highlighting the economic discrepancy between campus workers’ wages and wages of the national average. According to Soriano, university employees deserve better wages and pension pay than they are currently receiving.</p>\n<p>“Because our employees make so little money, our employees qualify for many public benefits, including MediCal, food stamps, housing subsidies and childcare subsidies,” Soriano said. <b></b></p>\n<p>In addition, a resolution in support of A.S. Bike Awareness Week — concerning pedestrian, skateboard and bicycle safety — was tabled. With a $90,000 budget, A.S. Bike Committee is currently looking outward for more funding assistance for their bike safety campaign causing Senators to argue over their request for more funding for items such as American Apparel t-shirts.</p>\n<p>IGNITE — or “Invest in Graduation, Not Incarceration. Transform Education” — discussed decreased funding for UC education in relation to increased funding for incarcerations. IGNITE is working to reverse issues facing UC students by passing three bills that aim to reprioritize education over prison spending.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, November 21, 2013’s print version of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/a-s-senate-discusses-pardall-center-ignite-bike-safety/","id":3068,"author":{"id":193,"name":"Elliott Wright"},"related":[3067,3066,3065],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Protesters Express Outrage Over Napolitano’s Exclusive Meeting with UCSB ‘Student Leaders’","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Chanting mantras like “Undocumented, Unafraid!” and “Hey hey, ho ho, Napolitano’s got to go!”, UCSB students rallied in opposition to the appointment of UC President Janet Napolitano, who wi...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Chanting mantras like “Undocumented, Unafraid!” and “Hey hey, ho ho, Napolitano’s got to go!”, UCSB students rallied in opposition to the appointment of UC President Janet Napolitano, who will be attending a closed meeting with “student leaders” today.</p>\n<p>Students are expressing outrage at the exclusivity of the meeting — which will take place at 9 a.m. at Mosher Alumni House — and are demanding that Napolitano take part in an open forum welcome to all students. The meeting was organized by administrators in the Division of Student Affairs and Associated Students officials, and 35 students — including representatives such as the Interfraternity Council President and A.S. president — will participate. The meeting will be closed off to other students.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, students marched from the Student Resource Building to the Faculty Lounge, demanding a public forum with the newly appointed UC president, who was the Secretary of Homeland Security before becoming the new leader of the UC system.</p>\n<p>Napolitano’s appointment, which came in July, has largely received backlash from many students since she is the first UC president to lack a background in education, previously acting as the governor as well as attorney general of Arizona. She has also drawn much criticism from the undocumented immigrant student community since she spearheaded the controversial Secure Communities program during her time as Secretary of Homeland Security. The deportation program seeks out undocumented immigrants using fingerprints by provided the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to the site for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and deported around two million undocumented immigrants — including non-criminal persons — during Napolitano’s term.</p>\n<p>At yesterday’s protest, student held up a giant banner highlighting the “No” in “Napolitano,” students from UCSB’s I.D.E.A.S. — or Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success — as well as other campus organizations, marched past UC Police Department officers and CSOs until finally arriving to the Faculty Lounge, where they were met by Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead. After criticizing Napolitano on her implementation of record-breaking deportation programs as former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, students asked Yang and Armistead if there could be a public forum allowing more students to speak than the few “student leaders” selected by administrators.</p>\n<p>I.D.E.A.S. member and second-year student Abigail Salazar said many undocumented students on campus have been directly affected by Napolitano’s deportation programs, herself included.</p>\n<p>“With all due respect, this is a person who has invaded my home, who has destroyed my family and I wasn’t even invited [to the meeting],” Salazar said. “I want to direct a lot of feelings that I have towards her. I have that right.”</p>\n<p>Salazar also said administration’s decision to hold a private meeting instead of a public forum with Napolitano further insulted the undocumented student community.</p>\n<p>“I command you, Chancellor Yang, to hold a public forum,” Salazar said. “We’re not going anywhere … we will not stand by this any longer. Do you understand us? With all respect, do you understand us?”</p>\n<p>In response to student demands, Armistead said Napolitano would leave right after tomorrow morning’s private meeting and that there was thus “not enough time for a public forum.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure that everybody who was picked is happy to have an open forum,” Armistead said. “They actually want to have a dialogue, and the concern is — that this happens within the public forum, then nothing can happen and you can’t have a conversation.”</p>\n<p>Attendees of tomorrow’s meeting include A.S. executive officials, leaders of campus organizations such as Human Rights Board, I.D.E.A.S. and S.C.O.R.E., or Student Commission on Racial Equality, as well as members of Greek life. However, some of the students invited are not currently the head of any campus group, according to Mario Vasquez, a member of Human Rights Board.</p>\n<p>Chicano Studies professor Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, who joined students in protesting today, said he has taught many students who have dealt with deportation on a personal level. He said student demonstrations should push Napolitano to support the undocumented student community and advocate for immigration policy reform.</p>\n<p>“She could apologize for what she did, and she could put pressure on the Obama administration to stop what it’s doing,” Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval said. “It’s nearly deported two million people, which is more people combined than any other in U.S. history.”</p>\n<p>Napolitano has also expressed support for the DREAM Act and undocumented students, and she recently devoted $5 million in UC funding to financial aid and special counseling for undocumented UC students, according to a UC Office of the President press release.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Norma Orozco expressed opposition to the appointment of Napolitano both because of her experience in the Department of Homeland Security and her lack of professional academic experience.</p>\n<p>“This is the president of our university. This is the person that is supposed to make the most critical decisions for universities, such as where our funding goes and where our funding comes from,” Orozco said. “She was in charge of increasing the budgets for our military … that’s not what a university’s about.”</p>\n<p>According to Armbruster-Sandoval, Napolitano should respond to student protest and demand for a public forum if she wants to save face as the rightful president of the UC.</p>\n<p>“So the idea is to say, ‘Hey we’re not happy with this, listen to us,’” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “Apologize, do something, show some contrition, show that you’re a human being, that you have some heart, basically, because you’ve broken our hearts.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"500598246\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"53199\"><img data-attachment-id=\"53201\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-22/protesters-express-outrage-over-napolitanos-exclusive-meeting-with-ucsb-student-leaders/napolitano-protest-johnclow_11-21-2013-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1385052985\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"19\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Napolitano Protest JohnClow_11.21.2013-04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-53201\" alt=\"Napolitano Protest JohnClow_11.21.2013-04\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=520%2C300\" width=\"520\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Napolitano-Protest-JohnClow_11.21.2013-04.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Photo by John Clow / Daily Nexus</p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Commission on Student Well-Being, an organization dedicating to promoting healthy practices among UCSB students through various events and services.</p>\n<p>The measure constitutes one of two new A.S. fee initiatives on the ballot this year along with a proposal for a lock-in fee supporting the A.S. weekly newspaper, <i>The Bottom Line</i>. Of the total $1.03 fee, $.71 will go towards the organization, while the remainder will be put towards financial aid and covering administrative fees.</p>\n<p>Lisa Schwartz, a COWSB spokesperson and a current Peer Pre-Health Advisor at the Academic Advising Office, said the goal of the initiative is to gain funding for events that would enrich the physical and mental health of UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“The Associated Students Commission on Student Well Being (COSWB) is committed to the general wellbeing of UCSB undergraduates, with a particular emphasis on mental wellbeing,” Schwartz said. “Its purpose is to increase awareness, educate, and advocate for students. COSWB also creates many programs that provide a positive and comfortable environment for students on campus.”</p>\n<p>COSWB currently holds weekly free fitness class at the UCEN and in Isla Vista, including yoga, Krav Maga, kickboxing and hip-hop dancing. In addition, COSWB hosts events that educate students on healthy eating habits, mental health issues and other health-related topics, Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>“A few weeks ago we had a bounce house. It was amazing to watch the difference in people’s demeanor as they left feeling rejuvenated and refreshed,” Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>Should the fee initiative pass, COSWB’s plan is to expand on the services they already provide for students, according to fourth-year biopsychology major.</p>\n<p>“We plan to lead off campus trips that will be available at no additional charge for students,” Schwartz said. “These events include whale watching, day trips and camping at the Channel Islands, game trucks and additional fitness classes both in IV and on campus.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/","id":3070,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3069,3068,3067],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
