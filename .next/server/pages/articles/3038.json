President Jonathan Abboud presented his ideas to chairs and co-chairs of A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions, or BCCs, after completing a revision of another restructuring plan, which was presented at the last BC4 meeting. In the revised restructuring plan, A.S. would no longer be divided into BCCs, and instead the Association would be divided into Senate Standing Committees, Senate Administrative Committees, Units and lastly, Boards and Commissions. Thus, current groups — or BCCs — would be placed into one of these categories according to their function or issue of focus; for example, the A.S. Bike Committee would be considered a Unit. This new organization of BCCs makes for increased involvement of the A.S. Senate through several different implications and changes — such as one change to the electoral process for selecting BCC chairs.</p>\n<p>Currently, BCCs have primary control over the selection of their leaders: the majority of groups have an internal election and then forward the names of elected officials to the A.S. president and Committee on Committees, which fills out the necessary paper work. The A.S. president gives a ‘rubber stamp’ approval of the decision and Senate ratifies it, but the Senate does not play a major role beyond this brief approval process. In the new restructuring plan, Abboud proposed that members of Senate and the Executive Board be part of the process of selecting the incoming board members of each group. In this process, two members of the group and the outgoing position-holder would remain as voting members. However, many chairs felt that this proposed process would jeopardize their ability to function independently and as best as possible.</p>\n<p>Friday’s presentation, which also included the participation of Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young, was generally met with extensive questioning and criticism, as many BCCs were skeptical of its effects on their autonomy.</p>\n<p>Abboud, along with senate Pro-Tempore Ali Guthy, used a PowerPoint presentation to show how they planned to change the structure of Associated Students. Abboud prefaced the discussion with a plea for civility.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been disappointed with how negative things have been,” Abboud said. “Let’s just try to be constructive.”</p>\n<p>While most attending BCC chairs were not enthusiastic about any aspect of the presentation, the most contentious issue was the proposed change to the selection process for chairs and board members.</p>\n<p>Anisha Ahuja of Human Rights Board said she did not “understand how cutting the amount of voting members” would be beneficial to the selection process.</p>\n<p>According to Co-Chair of Take Back the Night — a sexual assault awareness group — Kelty Kauffman, her organization’s mission is to create a safe space for sexual assault survivors; thus, it is important that the selection committee be well versed in the field. With the current process, Kauffman said the group is able to follow this mission and she rejected the idea that such a selection process may result in unfair exclusivity.</p>\n<p>“Take Back the Night is such a sensitive space and it is considered a safe space for survivors … it’s not so much a cliquey thing it’s about choosing people who are sensitive to the issues at hand,” Kauffman said. “I personally think that there are people in the past who have been involved who have not been sensitive to the issues at hand. Picking people who are heavily involved … is not being cliquey.”</p>\n<p>Several members of Program Board were present at the meeting to voice their concerns about the restructuring plan. One member said he felt creating a uniform process for appointments of new board members was inherently ineffective because “BCCs operate at different levels and operate in different ways.”</p>\n<p>Abboud defended the inclusion of senators in appointments, as a way of instituting “checks and balances” and for senators to be more informed of the process, so that when it came time to approve the appointments in Senate, they would know what they were approving.</p>\n<p>“They have to be present so they know what’s going on [and] they’re not making uninformed votes,” Abboud said. “What I’ve seen for four years in A.S. is every time appointments go up … they kind of just pass … what if there’s a problem?”</p>\n<p>Kyle Trager, general manager of KCSB — which would be exempt from the addition of senators in the selection process, as KCSB is an entity of the press — still took issue with the need for a change in the selection process.</p>\n<p>“Should it not be the job of the president and the non-student staff of A.S., who have an institutional memory, to really push the senators to be proactive?” Trager asked Abboud and Guthy.</p>\n<p>Abboud responded that he has “no authority over the Senate.”</p>\n<p>Abboud and Guthy eventually agreed to scrap the idea of the selection process and take the concerns of the chairs into consideration; however, many were still unsatisfied with the restructure as a whole. Hani Tajsar, of Student Commission on Racial Equality, said he felt Abboud was “trying to fix imaginary problems,” and Mohsin Mirza of Student Lobby said “a one-size-fits-all solution might not be the best idea.”</p>\n<p>How, Guthy said that grouping BCC according to the new categories outlined will make for a more efficient and fair process that does not infringe on any organization’s individual autonomy.</p>\n<p>“Nothing about the restructure will change the way that these groups function,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Abboud and Guthy plan to revise the restructure plan once again and bring it back for yet another discussion.</p>\n<p>In addition to the restructuring plan, BCCs discussed a bill recently passed at A.S. Senate regarding food budgets, presented on-going projects and engaged in a question-and-answer with Vice Chancellor Michael Young.</p>\n<p>Speaking at the meeting about his opinion of A.S. as a whole, Vice Chancellor Young said no one could better represent and advocate the needs of the student body.</p>\n<p>“Even though people like me truly do care about you — I work for your best interests — in many ways, you are the best protectors of your interests,” Young said. “I can’t speak for students … the vast majority of the presidents that I’ve had the pleasure and opportunity to work with have done just that.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Monday, February 3, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53842\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53842\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/","id":3038,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3037,3036,3035],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard","biography":"Not available","articles":[3010,3012,3020,3021,3027,3029,3038,3040,3043,3050,3058,3060,3061,3071,3072,3074,3076,3078,3079,3081,3085,3087,3089,3092,3098,3102,3104,3106,3107,3108,3109,3111,3112,3113,3115,3116,3117,6138],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Catalyst Requests Lock-in for Print Costs","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The students behind The Catalyst, a new student-run literary arts magazine, have requested a lock-in fee in the upcoming Associated Students election in an effort to ensure continued quarterly publica...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The students behind The Catalyst, a new student-run literary arts magazine, have requested a lock-in fee in the upcoming Associated Students election in an effort to ensure continued quarterly publications.</p>\n<p>A revival of the Catalyst Literary Journal, which ran from 1992 to 2007, the magazine is a student publication of the UCSB English Department that allows students across different disciplines to collaborate and showcase their creative art and writing. The proposed lock-in fee will charge undergraduates $1.08 a quarter, beginning in the fall quarter of the 2014 academic year and will go towards publication and distribution costs of The Catalyst.</p>\n<p>Of the $1.08 fee, $0.75 will go towards The Catalyst with the rest directed towards A.S. and administrative services as return-to-aid.</p>\n<p>The inaugural Winter 2014 issue of The Catalyst featured creative prose, poetry and academic writing juxtaposed with hand-drawn art and photos. All the work in the 80-page winter issue was submitted by UCSB students, however, the magazine is not limited to undergraduates; The Catalyst also accepts submissions from UCSB graduate students, faculty and alumni.</p>\n<p>Third-year English major Natalie O’Brien, who serves as The Catalyst’s editor in chief, said the proposed lock-in fee could “make or break” the magazine depending on whether or not it passes. According to O’Brien, the magazine staff relied on the UCSB English department, individual students and local donations to fund its first publication, which she does not see as being reliable in the future. O’Brien also said the magazine wants to ensure that it remains free of cost to students.</p>\n<p>“The costs of printing our magazine, especially in color, are staggering and we really need help from students,” O’Brien said.</p>\n<p>According to O’Brien, only 750 copies of Winter ’14 issue The Catalyst were printed and more than half of those went to attendees at the magazine’s launch party in January.</p>\n<p>If the initiative passes, O’Brien said she believes the magazine can more widely circulate around campus and Isla Vista. Otherwise, The Catalyst could be restricted to an online edition, she said.</p>\n<p>“We only made our magazine available in print at the Isla Vista Food Co-Op and at the English department, and we have had a tough time just keeping these two locations stocked with magazines,” O’Brien said. “We would hate to only publish our content online.”</p>\n<p>Although an online edition would be the most cost effective way to publish The Catalyst, O’Brien said she and contributors to the magazine want printed copies available to readers.</p>\n<p>First-year art major Vijay Masharani, whose artwork appears throughout the publication’s first issue, said he believes The Catalyst gives artists like himself a good opportunity to collaborate with individuals from other disciplines and majors.</p>\n<p>“Visual artists, sculptors, theorists, writers and critics work in an interdisciplinary manner that really poses an interesting challenge to the individual artist,” Masharani said. “The Catalyst promotes a mode of art that is more resonant because it represents a conversation between multiple people, as opposed to a monologue coming from one person.”</p>\n<p>Masharani said he believes working with others students to create artwork for The Catalyst has been invaluable in his maturation as an artist.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Mariah Tiffany also said she appreciates The Catalyst for being an effective outlet for her own creativity.</p>\n<p>“Although I am not an art major, I love photography and The Catalyst has been a great platform for me to exhibit my talents,” Tiffany said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, April 17, 2014’s print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/the-catalyst-requests-lock-in-for-print-costs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/the-catalyst-requests-lock-in-for-print-costs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/the-catalyst-requests-lock-in-for-print-costs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/the-catalyst-requests-lock-in-for-print-costs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/the-catalyst-requests-lock-in-for-print-costs/","id":3035,"author":{"id":149,"name":"Max Fernbacher"},"related":[3034,3033,3032],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

It also includes several exceptions, such as special events.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the authors of the bill hope to discourage extravagant consumption of expensive food at board, committee and commission meetings, as they feel that money could be better spent fulfilling that group’s purpose.</p>\n<p>Issues surrounding the measure’s passage included accusations of classism, worries that certain groups may not be able to carry out specific functions that revolve around food and arguments that food at meetings is a primary method of attracting new members.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Navkiran Kaur said she feels the bill alienates many low-income students who depend on meals provided by A.S. organizations.</p>\n<p>Kaitlyn Christianson, co-chair of the Community Affairs Board, asserted that free food at meetings was a key factor in her choice to become involved in local affairs and warned that C.A.B. would not be able to carry out some of its key missions, such as providing food for the homeless, with such a restricted budget.</p>\n<p>As of press time, senators had not yet discussed the issue.

The funds collected from the fee would go towards operations, facility rental and staffing, according to the fee initiative.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Legal Resource Center attorney Robin Unander, who has been working on bringing a sobering center to the community for many years and called it the center’s “brain child,” the center would serve to cut down on the number of arrests for drunk-in-public citations, keeping students’ records free of misdemeanors and reducing the cost of an arrest.</p>\n<p>However, Unander also said a fine would still have to be associated with the sobering center to act as a deterrent to repeat offenders.</p>\n<p>“Because the partying in I.V. goes on where people live, there needs to be something in place that tells students ‘You don’t want to do that again if you can avoid it,’” Unander said.</p>\n<p>According to Unander, the fines collected for a night spent in the sobering center would help to pay for its operation and the money collected through the fee initiative would only have to be used as a startup cost allowing the center to eventually pay for itself.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet said she has been working on the ballot fee initiative since being a senator last year and that students brought to the sobering center would be handled primarily through the school and that a record of their stay will remain private.</p>\n<p>“When it goes on your BARC it will not say ‘drunk-in-public,’ it will say something like ‘administrative fee,’” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>Scarlet said that any fee assessed by the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program would be listed on BARC as usual.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs Alex Moore said the fee initiative is unique and has wide-ranging benefits.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of the rare opportunities where it’s a win-win-win situation for everyone … I think we actually have something that is straight-up good for everybody,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>According to Moore, students would no longer be detained in the main jail in Santa Barbara if the initiative passes. Instead, students would be held in an alternate space primarily occupied by students. Moore said the sheriff’s department would also benefit from the center by not having to drive students downtown, saving valuable time and allowing deputies to spend more time patrolling.</p>\n<p>Moore said he thought the benefit to students, as the primary users of the center, would justify the cost of the initiative.</p>\n<p>“It’s like insurance,” Moore said. “You’re looking at paying for it right now and you’re like ‘Man, I don’t know if I want to pay for that.’ But the first time your car gets nicked or the first time you get sick, that insurance policy turns into something amazing.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified A.S.
