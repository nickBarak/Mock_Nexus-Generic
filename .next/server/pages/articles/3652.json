G. Kelley, a professor of African American studies and American history at UC Los Angeles; and Josh Kun, a professor of communication and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The webinar began with a discussion about the meaning of the phrase “I can’t breathe,” a phrase associated with the Black Lives Matter movement and some of the last words from </span><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/i-cant-breathe-george-floyds-words-reverberate-oppression\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">George Floyd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/10/23/559498678/i-can-t-breathe-explores-life-and-death-at-the-hands-of-police\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eric Garner</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two Black men who were both killed by white police officers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gray highlighted the phrase’s dual meaning, both as a symbol of environmental racism experienced by Black people and the product of illegal choke holds used by law enforcement to detain Black people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think about breath in terms of environment and polluted air and the environmental degradation that Black and brown people have to live through,” Gray said. “Breathe and breathing as the terms to understand the devastating health impact of the pandemic of COVID-19, which disproportionately attacks Black and brown people, particularly around respiratory systems in urban populations and older populations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Breath also expresses the constricted air available to Black men, women and children at the hands of police, through illegal tactics like choke holds and knees to the neck,” he continued. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Breath is constricted because of the stresses and strains that parents, grandparents, partners, whose daily life is often relegated to overcrowded and under resourced conditions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson discussed the role of the protests in inciting change and how the ongoing struggle for equality is representative of “a different kind of calculus of human work.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of the things that are happening right now, while they are incredibly concerning, they are also, as we all know, incredibly hopeful and powerful,” Johnson continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation shifted from domestic movements to international ones, Davis discussed the global response to police brutality and racial inequality. She highlighted her experiences with academics and activists from the Brazilian state of Amazonas, which she said suffers from not only discrimination and violence from the police, but also an extreme militarization of its police. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The nation state [in America], as we know it, is no longer possible, and so a broad international perspective not only helps us to imagine solidarity but to think about what kind of future we want,” Davis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we say ‘abolish prisons,’ when we say ‘abolish the police,’ we are thinking about a future in which we will have moved beyond the bourgeois capitalist notion of the nation state,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Davis, Kelley revisited the development of the nation state and its efforts to facilitate racial inequality as a “repressive arm” that asserts control through “police power [and] military power,” he said, especially during times of unrest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In responding to Davis’ comments about dismantling the nation state, Kelley said Davis is “laying out a vision of internationalism, which is in some ways the beginnings of a global vision that focuses on the conditions of the least of us, that creates the conditions of life for working people around the globe.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things about this moment we’re in now is that it is deeply international, it’s deeply multiracial, it is broad, and … it builds on a decade of struggles that Black Lives Matter, in particular, has laid out,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Kelley, Johnson spoke about how the rise of authoritarianism and policing in America speaks to the fragility of white supremacy, and how those who support the nation state are reinforcing the “master narrative,” which Johnson described as the belief that the inequalities Americans face are unique to this country. That, however, is untrue, Johnson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even when you hear people who are liberals talk about, ‘Oh I can’t believe this is happening in our country and everybody is hurting, I can’t believe we’re in these times.’ These times have always been here,” Johnson said. “The only thing that has changed, is again, we’ve had enough.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis added that unlike past movements, especially those that predate the digital era of citizen journalism — the phenomenon in which ordinary bystanders or witnesses to an event can record and share those events through social media — the public reaction to the death of George Floyd has been met with </span><a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/george-floyd-protests-world-racism/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intense and widespread emotion.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was something about the witnessing of George Floyd’s last breaths that has become a collective phenomenon. We’ve all been transformed because we’ve all seen the last nine minutes of this brother’s life,” Davis said. “That emotional connection has been very much lacking in our movements prior to the more recent era.”    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis also said that the feminist intersection of organizing movements for Black lives often goes unrecognized, although the </span><a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/our-co-founders/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Lives Matter movement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, along with many others, was founded and run by Black women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelley applauded the efforts of Black women in organizing demonstrations — citing one that took place just outside his house on Beverly Boulevard. “All they have is a face mask,” he said, highlighting the fact that many Black female activists are risking their lives to organize demonstrations in the wake of the coronavirus, which </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-coronavirus-racial-disparities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disproportionately affects</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Black people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to leading movements, Kelley said some people still subscribe to the ideology that “what the movement needs is the male leader.” Although people still hold onto that idea, he said, “I think it’s dying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation drew to a close, Kun spoke to the momentum of the ongoing worldwide movements for Black lives and the unprecedented intensity by which society is demanding change. He warned, however, that this intensity will die down, but that it’s imperative to avoid compressing “longitudinal” movements — those that span months or years — into a week of protests, which can damage their longevity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis is impressed with the progress already made by movements for Black lives, and “the extent to which notions of systemic racism, structural racism, institutional racism [have] thoroughly permeated the mainstream.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an extremely important moment because [the] work that we’ve been doing for such a long time … seems to be reaching a kind of fruition,” she said. “But I’m especially interested in Black Lives Matter — the negative responses that first occurred when the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ emerged in the context of the Ferguson protests.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So many people were saying, ‘Shouldn’t all lives matter?’ But I think now people are beginning to get it,” she said. “And I’ve seen a lot of signs that say ‘All lives will not matter until Black lives matter.’”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Foot Patrol</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So this is an issue that I’ve been talking about with my friends for a while, but I decided to finally do something about it, mostly because of the amount of trees that did fall last year,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman and Vukcevich met with Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services Garry MacPherson at the end of fall quarter to discuss the tree removal, which is currently underway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said the university had already removed 31 eucalyptus trees over winter break that were considered “high-risk, or near population centers,” including several near Santa Rosa Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Foreman, MacPherson said that removing high-risk trees is much less expensive than fixing damage done to property once trees have fallen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he was told that it cost approximately $750,000 last winter to repair properties that were damaged by fallen trees, whereas it would cost approximately $250,000 to remove all high-risk trees on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman added that MacPherson expressed strong support for the resolution and said MacPherson told him that “something like this resolution is really needed to show the entirety of the administration that this is an issue that the students value and would like to see taken care of.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The language of the resolution notes that in addition to eucalyptus trees “[posing] a danger to public safety,” the trees are not native to the area and “do not support any ecological environments native to Santa Barbara.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution stipulates that the UCSB administration should focus its tree-removal efforts on “areas that have a higher likelihood to cause loss of life or damage to infrastructure in the case of tree failure — namely major walkways, major bikeways, and lived-in buildings (on campus as well as in the vicinity of Isla Vista).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next priority should be areas where tree roots have damaged road or bike infrastructure, the resolution added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman emphasized that the support for tree removal is contingent on the trees being replaced at a one-to-one ratio with trees that are native and support local wildlife, like the birds who typically nest in the eucalyptus trees. The trees must be planted “at or adjacent to the immediate locations where trees were removed,” according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman credited the EAB for those stipulations and said the board had helped with ensuring the resolution was environmentally friendly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ocean Road Housing project, which was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/university-takes-second-attempt-at-controversial-faculty-housing-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recently revived</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after being put on pause after “mounting public pressure,” as the Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-01-28/officials-pause-ocean-road-proposal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2009, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2009-02-05/vision-2025-apt-to-give-ucsb-bad-eyesight/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">faced criticism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the fact that the proposal included plans to remove the eucalyptus trees that stretched along Ocean Road. In addition to opposition to the trees themselves being removed, students expressed concern about the loss of separation between the university and Isla Vista on Ocean Road that the trees historically have created.</span></p>\n<p>When asked about a connection between the resolution and the Ocean Road Housing Project, Vukcevich said he hadn’t read the documents yet and declined to comment. Foreman said that while a number of the trees that would be removed for the housing project were ones that were considered high risk, he wasn’t sure how that would correspond to the project and said removing them “to prevent any incidents” was ideal.</p>\n<p><em>Arturo Martinez Rivera contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the January 9 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The faculty currently consists of Rodríguez, a lecturer on campus, and Cherrie Moraga, a professor in the English Department at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The group, which stems from the English Department at UCSB, aims to educate students and preserve the thought, traditions and culture of indigenous communities, according to its website.</p>\n<p>“Indigenous thought has been fragmented, punctured, disengaged, decontextualized, made into these little kind of exotic things. [Las] Maestras center wanted to bring [indigenous thought] back into focus,” Rodríguez said.</p>\n<p>With initial funding they received from UCSB, Rodríguez hopes to continue to expand Las Maestras through developing programs, hiring interns and developing a voice on campus. In the six months since opening, Las Maestras has already begun to connect with other groups seeking collaborations.</p>\n<p>Rodríguez stresses the importance of individuals to stay active in their communities and pay attention to the social and political issues happening around them.</p>\n<p>“Unless you stop injustice, it will continue to roll and eventually you’re gonna feel it,” Rodríguez said. “We have to keep vigilant and keep active. I think that’s an important piece of it, you know, because it’s not over.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Sept. 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

the way that students are supported and included contributes to their academic and professional success.</p>\n<p>The Nexus interviewed several directors of Student Affairs departments and found that the university’s main success comes from bolstering the student body; from the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) to Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.), the university’s programs help foster a healthy environment.</p>\n<p>However, problems also stem from rising enrollment rates, which have left university resource programs struggling to provide for a student body that increases by several hundred students each year.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jones, director of EOP, said the needs of students will always exceed the department’s abilities to meet those needs, which consistently leaves departments in a game of catch-up.</p>\n<p>“Student Affairs … [has] for decades struggled to keep up with the resources needed to provide for the services the students have either needed, or quite frankly demanded,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Even when departments can predict an influx of students, it is still difficult to prepare for the one-on-one services they might require, said Gary White, director of the Disabled Students Program (DSP).</p>\n<p>“I think we’re [servicing] about maybe six percent of our student population and we know the national average is almost 11, 10.9 percent,” White said.</p>\n<p>“We know that they’re coming … and we want to have the resources, the firepower, the systems in place so that we can handle when that onslaught comes.</p>\n<p>One of the DSP’s most common services is providing alternate testing locations for students during their midterms and finals, which can be difficult given the disproportionate amount of classrooms and labs on campus compared to the number of students, according to White.</p>\n<p>“It’s just one of those things where we don’t have time to gripe about ‘oh, this is a roadblock,’ it’s just like ‘alright, we gotta make it a speed bump’ and still keep going forward,” White said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is legally mandated to ensure that all students have equal access to educational opportunities on campus, so any failure of the DSP to do so would leave the university open to lawsuits.</p>\n<p>As the campus continues to grow, several Student Affairs departments cite concerns about being able to service their students.</p>\n<p>For instance, C.A.R.E. – an unusual department at UCSB, as most college campuses don’t dedicate entire offices to student advocacy – Director Brianna Conway said her staffers still find it difficult to always have someone available for a student because of how many students they serve.</p>\n<p>Jones also noted a similar problem with the EOP office.</p>\n<p>“We’re just going to have to be more mindful of managing time and resources to be as efficient as possible while not losing out on quality or our ability to be able to connect individually with students,” he said.</p>\n<p>These problems are the result of minimal funding, a key problem within the University of California system.</p>\n<p>“Funding is always an issue,” White said. “We’re getting as much as we can.”</p>\n<p>White does his best to “keep folks abreast of the numbers” and continually updates the vice chancellor’s office as enrollment in DSP increases throughout the school year.</p>\n<p>Despite these difficulties, White believes DSP offers students who wouldn’t traditionally attend university the opportunity to succeed.</p>\n<p>“We know that if someone is qualified to come, there needs to be space for them to be here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Several departments in the division of Student Affairs highlight the importance of providing students with a sense of belonging, which in turn can help students succeed academically.</p>\n<p>“Research shows that a student is more academically successful and happier when they feel like they belong in a place,” said Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of Student Life.</p>\n<p>Armistead overlooks the cluster of Student Affairs departments that revolve around student life, particularly the Office of Student Life (OSL). OSL focuses on fraternity and sorority life, registered organizations and leadership development.</p>\n<p>While Armistead feels the OSL has strengthened its relationship with fraternities and sororities in recent years, she now wants to turn attention to registered organizations on campus.</p>\n<p>With the recent hire of campus organizations coordinator Justin Littleton, a recent UCSB graduate and former OSL intern, Armistead hopes to see memberships in registered organizations grow with the dedicated attention Littleton will be providing.</p>\n<p>Armistead also prides herself on the “one-stop shop” aspect of the OSL.</p>\n<p>“People come to us for so many different things and what we try never to do is ‘Oh we don’t do that here.’ We try to at least connect students to where they need to be. We’ll pick up the phone, or we’ll even Google it for them so they don’t have to leave feeling like ‘Well now what do I do?’ ” she said.</p>\n<p>As head of C.A.R.E., Conway also sees the same duty as an essential part of her job.</p>\n<p>“I always like to think of it as we’re like a hub of the wheel, so the student doesn’t have to navigate all of these [campus entities] by themselves,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Conway and her staff work as direct service providers for students, staff and faculty who are dealing with sexual assault, domestic violence or stalking.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E.’s main office is located in the Women’s Center in the Student Resource Building (SRB); however, the office established a second location in Isla Vista two years ago in order to make itself more accessible to all students.</p>\n<p>“Not everyone wants to walk into the women’s center –– what about our male survivors? Or LGBTQ students that … come here for other spaces or events … to come and receive services might not feel as comfortable,” she said.</p>\n<p>Conway also notes the lack of graduate students who approach the C.A.R.E. office for assistance.</p>\n<p>“I think sometimes grad students don’t feel like there’s a place for them, or that the services aren’t for them or aren’t tailored for them,” she said.</p>\n<p>The C.A.R.E. office has grown since Conway first started in 2013, from three full-time staff members and one part-time staff member to an office of eight full-time staff members and several interns.</p>\n<p>The inclusion of student interns on staff has helped to bring student insight to the office, Conway said.</p>\n<p>The EOP office also relies on a similar peer-to-peer model in developing a sense of belonging for its students, who are primarily, but not exclusively, first-generation students and come from low socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“EOP’s mission and history is our ability over the many years to be able to have both a collective and an individual connection to students, and that’s certainly made a difference in my undergraduate career and as a professional staff person. Sometimes for a student at a particular point in life, that [connection] makes all the difference,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>While most students develop that sense of belonging through campus organizations, Associated Students (A.S.) President Brooke Kopel wants to help students who aren’t involved in organizations feel at home on campus.</p>\n<p>“Our student government, our administrators, our faculty need to be the ones who are making sure students, regardless of whatever they’re involved in, feel welcomed on campus, feel like they can get help when they need it,” she said.</p>\n<p>Kopel says that although there is always room for improvement, the university “has the best intentions in mind for its students, even when it falls short at times.”</p>\n<p>She believes what makes UCSB great is the pressure from students on the university over the years to make it more inclusive and supportive of its population.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons why … the EOP exists is because students in the mid-60s were demanding that there be some sort of place or home for students who have otherwise been denied access historically to public higher education at colleges and universities,” Jones added.</p>\n<p>Jones cites <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/one-year-later-el-centro-reopens-its-doors/\">El Centro</a> in particular as a pivotal space for Chicanx students, faculty and community members who find value and comfort in their shared history.</p>\n<p>“These spaces have provided a home away from home for first-generation college students whose parents may not necessarily have been able to prepare them for what it’s like to go into a college environment,” he said.</p>\n<p>As UCSB continues to support its students academically, Jones hopes the university also sees the value of the holistic support Student Affairs provides in its “direct and immediate” impact on students.</p>\n<p>“The need is there, so I think the challenge is how best we can [support our students] with the resources we have, with the needs that are always gonna exceed the resources.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Sept. 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
