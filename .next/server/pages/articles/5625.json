","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quick scroll through the Urban Outfitters’ website initially yields nothing new: overpriced sparkly party frocks, BDG mom jeans and those ugly FILA sneakers for which I can’t bear to jump on the bandwagon. But suddenly I do a double take when I click on the ‘Wellness’ section and see a host of vibrators, dildos and other various sex toys placed innocuously underneath the ‘Self Love’ division. A look at the Free People website reveals the same, albeit more expensive, result. Owned by the same parent company, Anthropologie, this sudden movement of younger-skewed brands to start marketing sex toys to a strongly feminist, sexually liberated generation smells strongly of bullshit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex-positive feminism is nothing new — it has been a movement embedded within the feminist community since the early 1980s. However, it seems that late Millennial and early Generation X women were swayed by the heavy presence of pornography-friendly sites like Tumblr in adolescence, leading to a positive outlook toward sex — notably masturbation and an emphasis on female pleasure. These early steps of social media sex positivity have led to a wide variety of successful multiplatform sex-themed websites and podcasts, including </span><a href=\"https://killerandasweetthang.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Killer and a Sweet Thang</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guys We F****d </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WHOREible Decisions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: all outlets where female-centric, queer-friendly and “taboo” sex practices take center stage. The demographic for brands like Urban Outfitters and Free People experienced a social media-induced sexual awakening in the mid-2010s that led to the radical conclusion that hey — maybe female pleasure isn’t such a big taboo after all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the onset, it seems great that mainstream companies like Urban Outfitters and Free People are jumping at the chance to support female sexuality. But after a closer examination, I am hesitant to buy into the free love narrative fed by a company in which only </span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/01/urban-outfitters-board-women/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22 percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the executive board is comprised of women. Maybe I’m just jaded, but for some reason, I am reluctant to believe that a bunch of older men of the Urban Outfitters board are super on board with the narrative of women loudly and proudly owning their sexuality. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These companies care about your money, not your orgasm.

In 2010, Urban Outfitters published a picture of an already tiny model in a slouchy v-neck emblazoned with the phrase </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/09/15/how-urban-outfitters-trades-on-moral-outrage/?utm_term=.b9282110ad07\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“eat less”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and have since been embroiled in </span><a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/480961/15-urban-outfitters-controversies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">several scandals</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> involving accusations of racial insensitivity, cultural appropriation and downright theft. Free People has additionally been accused of </span><a href=\"https://www.today.com/style/free-people-accused-appropriating-native-american-culture-festival-line-t85821\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appropriating</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Native American culture for festival lines. When major clothing companies don’t care about being socially, culturally or racially sensitive, why would they suddenly flip the script and support what has been a sexual taboo for generations? They’re simply just looking to turn a profit.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These companies care about your money, not your orgasm.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urban’s long and arduous list of scandals in juxtaposition with its sudden jump to selling vibrators, lube, whips and other bedroom-related products reeks of performative wokeness. Why would a company so notoriously nonchalant about apologizing for wrongdoings care about anything beyond their brand’s profit? When searching for products concerning one of the most intimate facets of a woman’s life, it seems illogical and counterproductive to patronize a brand that values business over people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a whole host of feminist companies that have been in the business of supporting female sexuality long before big companies sought out to capitalize on the “trend” of female pleasure. </span><a href=\"https://www.goodvibes.com/s/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good Vibrations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been a trailblazer in the industry, operating since 1977. </span><a href=\"https://www.babeland.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babeland</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has been around since 1993, is wholeheartedly committed to sex education and community involvement.

Those in search of DIY orgasms would have to drive to a sex shop situated in a strip mall on the opposite side of town and peruse the aisles with eyes averted from the other customers, paying cash at the register to avoid a paper trail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, all that shame and secrecy has flown out the window. Just this past year, millions of fed-up women </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/13/metoo-impact-hashtag-made-online/1633570002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weaponized a single hashtag</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to rewrite the rules of a convoluted sexual landscape. Buzz words like “empowerment” and “sex-positivity” represent the current iteration of feminism to which millennials subscribe. The feminists of 2019 sport “Pussy Power” buttons on their backpacks. They skip brunch to attend women’s marches. They open up about their sexuality not only to their closest friends but to their Twitter feeds as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And they shop for sex toys not in a dimly lit hole in the wall, but in the wide-open, colorful paradise of Urban Outfitters. Thanks to this mainstream retail outlet and its new collection of </span><a href=\"https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/self-love-products\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“self-love” products</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, female pleasure is just as accessible as a ’90s-inspired slip dress or a coffee table book of dad jokes. Featuring items such as bath bombs, “sex dust” (whatever that means) and emoji-shaped vibrators, the line advances an indulgent, pleasure-centered understanding of sexuality that “empowered” women are demanding in 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though these products may not be direct political statements, their arrival in the midst of a feminist revolution is no coincidence. Urban Outfitters is just one name in a long list of companies that have capitalized on hot-button social issues in recent years. Through ad campaigns like Gillette’s “</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Best Men Can Be</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” and Nike’s </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lomlpJREDzw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colin Kaepernick commercial</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, brands have attempted to align themselves with the political sensibilities of their consumers. Many of these campaigns have received backlash from news and social media critics who believe corporations should not be hailed as trailblazers of activism for nominally supporting social causes in order to sell razors or basketball shorts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is true that brands are profit-driven and don’t always follow their activist lip service with donations to causes or specific calls to action. These criticisms carry heavy weight at a time when Americans are becoming increasingly fed up with our country’s Machiavellian, profit-driven economic system. Among 18 to 29-year-olds — the demographic to which Urban Outfitters caters — </span><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approval ratings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of capitalism have plummeted by 23 percent in the past eight years.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the marketers at Urban Outfitters, a vibrator is not just a vibrator. It’s a symbol that their company endorses an open, shameless, modern vision of female sexuality.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as much as we hate the system, we must acknowledge that companies are meeting disillusioned shoppers in the middle by infusing a much-desired sense of meaning into the matrix of material consumption. According to a </span><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/championing-change-in-the-age-of-social-media/#Key-Findings\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two-thirds of Americans believe it’s “important for brands to take public stands on social and political issues.” Right now, consumers are demanding more than just products; they hope to spend their hard-earned money on symbolic representations of their deeply held beliefs. Gillette no longer sells razors; they sell a positive and healthy form of masculinity. Nike no longer sells sneakers and basketball shorts; they sell a bold commitment to racial equity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the marketers at Urban Outfitters, a vibrator is not just a vibrator. It’s a symbol that their company endorses an open, shameless, modern vision of female sexuality. Yes, this statement is undoubtedly motivated by profit. But it is a statement nonetheless, and a positive one at that. The </span><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sex-and-relationships/masturbation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of masturbation are numerous; the activity is known to reduce stress, improve sleep quality and improve body image, just to name a few.

As a beach town with a laid-back surfer vibe and beautiful weather conducive to outdoor activities, Isla Vista provides the perfect backdrop for a thriving stoner culture. Smoking provides the basis for many social rituals that UCSB students would consider memorable facets of college life, from nervously blowing smoke out the window of your freshman dorm room with your new friends to lighting up a bong with housemates in your I.V. apartment as an upperclassman.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weed brings Gauchos together in a way that few other things can. If you meet a potential friend in a class or dorm hall, for example, inviting them to a smoke sesh is a designated way to transition your connection from acquaintances to buddies with a shared experience. There are recognized scripts and etiquette rules around smoking weed that make it an easy social field to navigate, where one is not constantly worried about doing or saying the right thing. At UCSB specifically, indoor spaces like privately rented apartments and outdoor spaces like the beach provide the ideal environment for stress-free seshing.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>For UCSB students, an apartment with a tapestry on the wall and a bong on the coffee table is the symbolic equivalent of a house with a trimmed lawn and white picket fence.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to its cultural significance, weed provides a relatively safe avenue for students to engage in “rebellion” as youth inevitably will in some form or another. The social contexts in which Gauchos blaze up together are relatively safe, mellow and welcoming. While alcohol is also a huge part of social life at UCSB, the parties where it is consumed are often loud and crowded, with fighting and sexual violence occurring all too frequently. I’m not saying that alcohol is the sole cause of these negative events, but there definitely is a correlation between them. Students coming together for a smoke sesh are far less likely to encounter dangerous or compromising situations than students heading out to a party on DP. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue of negative health effects always looms over the head of any stoner attempting to sway the masses, and I’m not trying to deny that these effects exist. Reduced motivation and productivity, cognitive handicaps and potential long-term damage (though research on the latter is still mostly inconclusive) are all valid concerns.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Severe damage occurs not from smoking weed, but from smoking weed excessively to the point where it gets in the way of academics and other important pursuits.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, a comparison of costs and benefits reveals that these risks are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. In my opinion, the new friendships and social rituals that weed culture facilitates at UCSB outweigh the potential dangers. Severe damage occurs not from smoking weed, but from smoking weed excessively to the point where it gets in the way of academics and other important pursuits. As long as students use it as a social activity to relax after fulfilling their responsibilities for the day, there is no cause for alarm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gauchos are situated in a unique point in life that is fully conducive to reaping the benefits of smoking weed. Adult responsibilities have not fully set in, we are surrounded by peers with whom we can engage in social smoking and we attend school in a beautiful, laid-back beach town. For UCSB students, an apartment with a tapestry on the wall and a bong on the coffee table is the symbolic equivalent of a house with a trimmed lawn and white picket fence. I would urge any student who is apprehensive of the dangers of smoking to cast those doubts aside and grab some friends, spark a joint and enjoy the exceptional stoner culture that I.V. has to offer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Laurel Rinehart wants UCSB to remain a stoner’s safe haven.</em></p>\n<h3><strong>CON: There’s More to Life Than Devil’s Lettuce</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marijuana is a pervasive part of the culture of Isla Vista, and it certainly has brought many positive experiences for UCSB students. Smoking a bowl after a hard midterm or a casual smoke sesh by the beach can be good destressors when done in moderation. That being said, there are certain problems that a culture like that can bring, and with the legalization of recreational marijuana on the horizon, these problems could end up becoming worse.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>If you play hard, you have to work hard, and it’s more difficult to work hard if you’re smoking every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old stereotype of stoners being more prone to laziness while high does have some truth behind it. For every person who can smoke and do their work, there are three others who get high and put off their essays, studying and responsibilities. Being students at one of the top research universities in the country, we have a duty to maintain our reputation, and people who show up to class high or don’t do their schoolwork make us all look bad and ultimately lower the value of our degrees. If you play hard, you have to work hard, and it’s more difficult to work hard if you’re smoking every day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next issue directly relates to the everyday consumption of marijuana. Most people cannot or refuse to drink alcohol every single day of the week, but for some reason, people don’t mind smoking every day. This is a moderation problem, which affects all areas of life, not just academics. I’ve heard of so many people who are avidly against driving drunk, but driving high is completely fine to them. Obviously this is hearsay evidence, but still, there’s definitely not the same stigma around driving high as there is around driving drunk. Both are extremely dangerous and can put others at risk. If you’re high every day, there will come a day when you have to drive somewhere, and since the stigma isn’t the same. you’re more likely to shrug it off and do so.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Most people cannot or refuse to drink alcohol every single day of the week, but for some reason, people don’t mind smoking every day.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing to consider about I.V.’s weed culture is that the very nature of the drug is beginning to change dramatically. Strains are getting more potent. Edibles are no longer hastily made by your stoner roommate but instead are professionally made into gummy bears, and rice krispy treats contain far more THC than they used to. “Dabbing,” or concentrated butane hash oil, has now become mainstream and is even available to use in nifty little vape pens that you occasionally see in Davidson during a late-night study grind. Weed is getting more potent, and it’s spreading everywhere. It is no longer confined to a late-night bong sesh in your apartment but can be consumed in the library, while casually walking the street in I.V. or while cruising through the Arbor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, if people want to light up, that’s their own prerogative and it’s their own life. The problems that are associated with marijuana all stem from a lack of moderate consumption, and if you’re capable of doing so then by all means go for it. However, we do have responsibilities as students of UCSB to be the best we can be academically. If it’s getting in the way of your grades, it’s time for a self-check on what’s important to you.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology has undoubtedly changed how we communicate for the better. We now have the power to reach people on the other side of the world and learn about current events almost instantly. We use texting and social media to keep in contact with acquaintances and loved ones. We send kissy-face emojis to show affection and write happy birthday on our friends’ timelines. I live hundreds of miles away from my best friends and family members, yet I feel as close to them as ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, texting and the like has also created a dimension of communication that has never existed before — a type of communication that doesn’t require any words at all. Apple has dominated the electronic world for years now. Almost every single person we know owns one an Apple phone (unless you’re a fringe Android user). Centered at the forefront of modern communication, Apple was the first to create an option to show if the person you are texting has read your message. Now, apps like Facebook and Instagram have followed this trend and automatically use read receipts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is ridiculous, I know I am not the only one who gets extremely butthurt, for lack of a better word, when I see someone has read my message and chosen to not respond. My mind starts to wander: Did I say something wrong? Should I send another text? Do they hate me? I thought we were close but I guess not…. It’s as if a switch in my mind has been turned on and I frantically worry my relationship with this person is now suddenly different. Usually, the next time I see him or her I will realize that I was over-exaggerating and that switch will be turned right back off. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mysteriousness of not knowing whether someone has just skipped over your text on accident or is purposefully ignoring you is beautiful in my eyes.

I will read someone’s message and absorb all of the information, then completely forget to respond until five days later. Sometimes, I don’t respond on purpose. I simply just don’t have anything to say in response or get overwhelmed by the constant need to be connected with others. I want to sit with my thoughts for a couple days, or even hours, and respond when I am ready. Hypocritically, when I do this, of course it is harmless or a simple mistake. But then others do the same, I want to curl up in my room and never come out.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mind starts to wander: Did I say something wrong?

We’ve all received a “k.” response or interpreted a message with ten exclamation marks as overbearing and off-putting. It has been found that </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/college/2012/02/01/people-are-more-likely-to-lie-through-text-messages-study-finds/37388961/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people are much more likely to lie through text versus talking face-to-face or an audio or video chat</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The problem is that emotions cannot be interpreted as effectively without observing facial expressions and verbal tones. Read receipts reinforce this ambiguity when they leave the sender questioning what went wrong. Life was less complicated when people were forced to communicate face-to-face. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, let’s all agree that technology is confusing enough and leave read receipts behind.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ally McCulloch encourages everyone to stop obsessing over read receipts. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85873\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85873\" data-attachment-id=\"85873\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/argument-in-the-office-the-merits-of-read-receipts/img_4696/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4696\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-85873\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696-250x250.jpg?resize=396%2C396\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_4696.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85873\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read receipts on messaging platforms like iMessage, WhatsApp or Facebook have become a contentious topic among users since day one. While many of my friends voice their contempt for this whole level of passive aggressive messaging, I have always appreciated the credible information of the read receipt option whether that is proof for my friend’s ignorance or the clear message of my brother’s disinterest. And let’s be honest, feeding our relationship mind games, our inner control demons just want to know whether someone has read our messages or ditched us again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a private chat, my experience is that read receipts also positively impact conversation flows and response time. Once you have opened a message your partner is notified, so you are nudged into responding instantly. Although potentially a source for misunderstandings, a read receipt is a message in itself. And it is even more effective than not replying without the function. You can now avoid uncomfortable rejections or half-hearted conversations by signalling apparent disinterest without utilizing the power of words. It is essentially the straightforward way of finally “telling” your stalking admirer to bugger off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from facilitating the inconvenient task of giving someone the brush-off, I am convinced that read receipts convey a deep feeling of community and connection. Most people underestimate the reliability in planning and the lack of the feeling of insecurity provided by the function. This applies not only to meeting your date but also in group messages when you spontaneously decide to move your party from your friend’s house to Bill’s Bus on a Thursday night. Also, who has not experienced the beauty of immediate bonding when you text someone for the first time and you see they have the read receipt function as well? I kid you not, it is just mind-blowing to feel this deep connection of living life on the same page with your fellow iPhone buddies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not want technology in general and the read receipt function in particular to control your deepest fears, you can either go on a life changing phone detox or choose options to read messages without triggering the read receipt. But let’s face it, the detox is probably just one of many new year’s resolutions we won’t fulfil this year so let’s stick to alternatives that include keeping our instruments of sin in our pockets.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although potentially a source for misunderstandings, a read receipt is a message in itself. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we are a student newspaper dedicated to improving student communication for overall happiness and love I would like to end by offering some exclusive sneaky alternatives to circumvent read receipts for y’all: First, the screen pull-down technique allows you to read texts without triggering receipts so you are not pressured to reply at all and your conversation partners are for once not crying themselves to sleep. For our bougie Tim Cook supporters, a.k.a. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">owners of an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus: You guys can use the new Peek feature to view your screen without triggering the function. You’re welcome! And now, for a change: Immerse yourself in some face-to-face conversations that render this whole messaging magic useless.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon Ahrens emphasises the usefulness of read receipts but warns against taking them too seriously. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/77ba7e342d6b8818e9cdf560b4d82a29?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/77ba7e342d6b8818e9cdf560b4d82a29?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ally-mcculloch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ally McCulloch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ally McCulloch is an Opinion staff writer.

that “when someone says hello or smiles at you, your automatic reaction is to say hello or smile back.” Human beings as a whole strive to make connections to feel included in the group around them. In fact, the importance of greeting others has even been supported with movements such as “Just Say Hello,” a campaign supported by celebrities such as Oprah and Tom Hanks. You know that if Oprah supports something, it has to be legitimate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saying “Hello” is a key part in building community, which is why it’s part of my job as a desk attendant in the residence halls to greet everyone who walks into the lobby. Chances are, if you’ve walked past the front desk in my residence hall, you’ve probably been met with my only-vaguely-mechanical-sounding “Hello.” For the most part, people return the gesture and say “Hello” back. Sometimes, I even get a “How’s it going?” If you’re one of these people, the rest of this article does not apply to you. I appreciate how polite you are, and I’m glad to be one of your desk attendants. You are a gem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the rest of you though, I have one simple question.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why won’t you say “Hi” back? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of you look me straight in the eyes, making intense eye-contact as you walk by. “Hello!” I say cheerfully. Your eyes narrow as you make your way past the front desk, refusing to smile or even do the acknowledging head-nod. At that point, I have no idea what I’m supposed to do, so I generally just keep a fake smile plastered on my face until after you’ve passed by the desk.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, college is about making connections. What’s a better way to do that than to say “Hello?”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I genuinely doubt that this is a personal vendetta against me, as I’ve never spoken to you outside of the lobby. Do you do this to everyone? Is it your thing to just not say “Hi” to people? Do other people respond like I do, sitting in confused silence? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s also a few of you who just put so much effort into not saying “Hi” back that I feel kind of bad.  You enter the lobby with such purpose, avoiding eye contact and walking around the very outskirts of the room. I see you. Do you think I don’t? Just because you’re hugging the walls doesn’t mean that you’re invisible. This isn’t a middle school dance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes I think I won’t say “Hi” to you, since you’re clearly very intent on getting by without responding. Then I remember that it’s part of my job, and bleakly say “hi” [[cap]] as you continue slinking along against the wall. Okay. You do you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I get it. Sometimes you’ve had a bad day, and you really don’t want to talk to anyone. You want to retreat to the comfort of your dorm room and sleep away the rest of your day. You </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">especially </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don’t want to say “Hi” to the awkward girl at the front desk. Ultimately, everyone has these days, and I completely understand. Every so often, someone who typically greets me in return will walk by and not respond, only to go back to normal the next day. That’s fine, I get it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, college is about making connections.
