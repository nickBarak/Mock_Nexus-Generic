It passed with nearly unanimous support, as only Senator Montana MacLachlan chose to abstain from the vote.</p>\n<p>Regarding the resolution, student sponsor of the legislation Guy Singer said the bill provided adequate leeway for the university to implement its demands without undue burden.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to give the UC Regents … and the treasury a lot of space with this,” Singer said. “Because it’s a big transition, we are giving them five years.”</p>\n<p>According to Singer, the goal is to get similar legislation passed at all UC campuses during the summer.</p>\n<p>Later, discussion on the bill to update A.S. election code began when Senator Ansel Lundberg read a letter aloud in support of the bill, which demands that a new single transferable vote (STV) system be implemented before the next A.S. election. The system would use preferential voting in which students would rank candidates according to favorability and would roll over votes of candidates that received less first-choice votes.</p>\n<p>Lundberg said the current election system led to an unfair domination by a single party that does not accurately represent students.</p>\n<p>“The fact that a single party has come to dominate the representation of the entire student body represents a failure on the part of UCSB’s Associated Students,” Lundberg said.</p>\n<p>Lundberg said the large numbers of voters that did not support the Open People’s Party were essentially disenfranchised by the current system. Lundberg said this exclusion is even more prominent after “two straight years of thousands of votes cast for DP candidates [led] to zero seats in the Senate.”</p>\n<p>MacLachlan said the STV system has a set of its own concerns, particularly in how it encourages for a competition in popularity between candidates and marginalizes political party influence.</p>\n<p>“I know that one issue that has been talked about is that if people ran more individually then it would turn into a popularity contest,” MacLachlan said. “What’s the counterargument to that?”</p>\n<p>In response, Lundberg said the new electoral system would not compromise the ability of parties to impact elections.</p>\n<p>“I would say that it still allows parties to thrive and in no way undermines parties … We’re not trying to ban parties,” Lundberg said.</p>\n<p>Senator Derek Wakefield said the outgoing Senate is currently in an ideal position to pass legislation affecting the electoral system, as they are less likely to be hindered by political affiliations.</p>\n<p>“We are going to be leaving next week, so that puts us in a really good position to change toward a system such as this because essentially elections and winning is not as much in our minds,” Wakefield said.</p>\n<p>Wakefield also said the bill to change the A.S. elections process represents a significant, influential and final piece of legislation for this year’s Senate.</p>\n<p>“As our last act of Senate, we can change how we are represented,” Wakefield said.</p>\n<p>Following discussion on the bill to update the A.S. elections code, a bill to update student lobby legal code was tabled after various senators expressed opposition to it.</p>\n<p>Senator John Soriano said he felt concerned that the bill violated the lobby’s autonomy.</p>\n<p>“It’s not fair for the board to be told what to do before they’ve even been elected,” Soriano said.</p>\n<p>Senator Lupe Zelada said the independence of the student lobby was being attacked. According to Zelada, the A.S. President backtracked on a previous agreement.</p>\n<p>“I do have a problem with somebody attacking our autonomy in our election process, especially when Jonathan Abboud gave us his word that he was not going change that or touch that,” Zelada said. “He completely just backed out on his word, and I don’t appreciate that.”</p>\n<p>Other items covered during the meeting included a planned online marketplace for UCSB students to trade and sell textbooks called GauchoBooks, upcoming Human Rights Board elections and changes in and the transition between outgoing and incoming senators.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-16/a-s-senate-debates-election-code-update-and-university-investments/","id":3009,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3008,3007,3006],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson","biography":"Not available","articles":[2784,2815,2930,3003,3007,3009,3016,3018,3024,3041,3046,3052,3062,3064,3065,3124,3138,3493,3622,5935],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Fees For Non-A.S.

The fees are for university-based organizations outside of Associated Students, but they run on the same ballot as A.S. fees. Among the new initiatives fees, the MultiCultural Center and Counseling &amp; Psychological Services gained fee increases of $6.77 and $21.39, respectively, while UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures earned a new $5.68 fee to go toward development of an app and other general improvements. The reaffirmations were each passed by a wide margin, and included support fees for CLAS, the University Center, the MCC, CAPS, the Community Affairs Board, Recreational Sports, Career Services and the Green Initiative Fund.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Students Katya Armistead said she was disappointed with students’ decision to vote against the OSL fee, which narrowly failed by less than three percent. According to Armistead, “dwindling support” from state funds and growing demands on OSL services made the organization seek out a higher lock-in fee. She said the office plans to propose the fee increase again next year, as it offers a large number of student services that sometimes gain little recognition.</p>\n<p>“Any student who is a member of any of the 450 registered campus organizations (RCO) or who has simply attended an event hosted by an RCO has interacted with the Office of Student Life and would benefit directly from an increase to the OSL fee,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Armistead said the OSL plans to increase campaigning efforts next year, saying an inadequate amount of money allocated to promoting the initiative and the limited visibility of the office, among other factors, contributed to the fee’s failure to pass.</p>\n<p>“There are many possible reasons why the fee increase was not approved, and we believe that there is no single reason behind our failed fee increase,” Armistead said in an email. “While our professional and student staff members put in a phenomenal effort during a very busy quarter, we recognize that the campaign outcome is a direct result of our campaign strategy … This is a major “lesson learned” for our department.”</p>\n<p>Promoting the Arts &amp; Lectures lock-in fee earlier in the quarter, A&amp;L Programming Manager Heather Silva said the approved fee would help contribute to lower ticket prices, an app that would allow students to purchase tickets on mobile devices and general program improvements.</p>\n<p>“We serve both campus and community members, so it’s our mission to provide events that are diverse enough that we appeal to a wide variety of people in Santa Barbara proper,” Silva said. “For our campus events, we also try to make sure that we have events quarterly that really appeal to students.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, April 30, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/fees-for-non-a-s-orgs-affirmed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/fees-for-non-a-s-orgs-affirmed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/fees-for-non-a-s-orgs-affirmed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/fees-for-non-a-s-orgs-affirmed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/fees-for-non-a-s-orgs-affirmed/","id":3006,"author":{"id":181,"name":"Daniel Slovinsky"},"related":[3005,3004,3003],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

President’s 2014-2015 budget, undercover raids by the Isla Vista Foot Patrol and a plan to promote socially responsible investments of university funds.</p>\n<p>Next year’s budget proposal, roughly 10.7 million dollars, includes funding for staff members and student programs, marking an increase of $126 thousand over this year’s final budget. The bill was ultimately tabled for next week after an extensive debate over the reduced amount of money allocated for A.S. staff positions.</p>\n<p>A.S. staff member Aaron Jones said senators should “use their time wisely” when looking over the budget before approving it. He said many A.S. staff members were overwhelmed by the workload and putting in more hours than they were scheduled.</p>\n<p>“They all feel that they are doing more than is within their job description. I’ve asked them to do more because of the shortages we have in staff,” Jones said. “They do put in hours that are not necessarily accounted for.”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore gave a presentation to the A.S. Senate explaining some of the details behind the recent undercover operations by the Isla Vista Foot Patrol. Moore said that he has told officers that the undercover raids are not a productive way of policing Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“I mentioned to the law enforcement pretty strongly, as far as the community policing thing, this is, A, really unfortunate timing right after Deltopia because it feels like punishment, and B, just in general I feel like [it’s] not a very effective tool because all it will yield to is a bunch of [minor in possession]’s,” Moore said. “I feel that’s not something the community is very concerned about.”</p>\n<p>Moore also reported the results of the I.V. Needs Assessment Survey, a comprehensive poll that asks residents about their concerns for the community.</p>\n<p>“The number one priority for Isla Vista residents thus far is lighting and number two is affordable housing,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Moore said 91 percent of those polled reported that harassment was a consistent community problem.</p>\n<p>The Senate also voted unanimously to pass a resolution to create an ad-hoc committee to encourage UCSB to make socially responsible investment decisions based on human rights and environmental protection, among other criteria that remain to be determined. The resolution’s aim is to divest from corporations rated poorly in terms of corporate social responsibility by an independent group such as <i>The Economist</i>.</p>\n<p>Second-year biopsychology major Guy Singer said the resolution would do a great deal to repair some of the divisions that arose from the divestment meeting last week, citing bipartisanship support from American Support for Israel and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.</p>\n<p>“This specific resolution of the last few days has received a lot of input from both pro-Israel community and pro-BDS community to help bridge the gap between the pretty intense conflict that’s been present here for the last year,” Singer said. “This resolution is not only endorsed by leaders of both communities, but parts of it were written by both.”</p>\n<p>Other topics discussed at the meeting were the release of an issue of UCSB’s <i>Campus Point</i> magazine, the Chilla Vista festival that will occur Saturday in Perfect Park and a senior citizen prom being sponsored by the Community Affairs Board. In addition, the Senate took a moment to sing Off-Campus Senator-elect Emani Oakley a happy birthday song.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55128\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-02/a-s-senate-addresses-budget-ivfp-operations-university-investments/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55128\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-02/a-s-senate-addresses-budget-ivfp-operations-university-investments/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-02/a-s-senate-addresses-budget-ivfp-operations-university-investments/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-02/a-s-senate-addresses-budget-ivfp-operations-university-investments/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-02/a-s-senate-addresses-budget-ivfp-operations-university-investments/","id":3007,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3006,3005,3004],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Forum Addresses Master Plan Reform in Light of Funding Issues","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Leading up to the University of California Regents Meeting on May 14 and 15, the UCSB E.V.P.S.A Office, A.S.

Office of the President and A.S. Academic Affairs Board hosted a forum on the California Master Plan of Higher Education in the Student Resource Building yesterday.</p>\n<p>After UCSB became the first school to pass a resolution in support of reevaluating the Master Plan in 2013, UC President Janet Napolitano said at January’s UC Regent’s meeting that she was open to revising the plan to better serve students’ needs. Former A.S. President Harrison Weber, Literature and American Studies Professor Chris Newfield and Economics Professor Jon Sonstelie spoke at yesterday’s forum, offering different academic and professional perspectives on reevaluating the plan.</p>\n<p>According to Newfield, reforming the Master Plan is necessary because smaller UC campuses fund larger universities in the system and therefore have an actual investment in these other schools.</p>\n<p>“We could talk about breaking up the UC system for the simple reason that UC Santa Barbara and UC San Diego and the other smaller UC campuses subsidize UC Berkeley and UCLA,” Newfield said.</p>\n<p>Newfield said the UC system is currently struggling financially because California residents have not understood the importance of public investment.</p>\n<p>“We had 30 years of cheapness,” Newfield said. “Thirty years of older people not being willing to pay for younger people — 30 years of people not understanding what public investment is.”</p>\n<p>Sonstelie disagreed with Newfield’s desire to have the general public foot the cost of the University of California system, as he said college education needs to be funded partially through grants and loans. College graduates earn 50 percent more in wages over their lifetime than high school graduates do, according to Sonstelie, making fees an inevitable but not necessarily impossible obstacle.</p>\n<p>“I totally understand the problem that borrowing money now is a problem, but I think it’s the only way it works,” Sonstelie said. “It doesn’t make sense for someone to pay for another person to make 50 percent more money than them … I hate to say it, but we have to figure out how to finance education through some sort of grants and some sort of loans.”</p>\n<p>According to Sonstelie, debt can be managed in better ways than it currently is, possibly through the support of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>“I just think we need to make debt work better,” Sonstelie said. “What it comes down to is asking middle-class families in California to subsidize the education for people that will be wealthy in the future.”</p>\n<p>Former A.S. President Weber said the way students approach higher education today is fundamentally flawed. Many students are underprepared for the demands of a research university and should first attend junior colleges before determining whether they are suited for four-year research universities, according to Weber.</p>\n<p>“In my estimation, there should be far more students getting their first two years of education at a community college and then decide whether they want to go to a research university,” Weber said.</p>\n<p>Sonstelie disagreed with Weber and argued for increased competition at UC Santa Barbara. According to Sonstelie, UC Santa Barbara deserves more credit than it currently receives.</p>\n<p>“I’m in favor of more competition,” Sonstelie said. “The way the system is set up, there’s a monopoly on prestige. I’d like to see us compete up there more.”</p>\n<p>However, Newfield said the most important issue to address is funding, as once funding issues are rectified then the UC system will not have the same problems rationing resources for students.</p>\n<p>“We’re sending you out there to compete with Stanford students, and you get one class in four years with 15 students,” Newfield said. “We fix the funding issue first. With the sufficient funds, I don’t think there’s going to be the same amount of rationing needs.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55283\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-13/forum-addresses-master-plan-reform-in-light-of-funding-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55283\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-13/forum-addresses-master-plan-reform-in-light-of-funding-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-13/forum-addresses-master-plan-reform-in-light-of-funding-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-13/forum-addresses-master-plan-reform-in-light-of-funding-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-13/forum-addresses-master-plan-reform-in-light-of-funding-issues/","id":3008,"author":{"id":184,"name":"Aditya Tadanki"},"related":[3007,3006,3005],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
