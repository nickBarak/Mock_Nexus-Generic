Carrozzo signed an administrative order to continue most cases in the Santa Barbara Superior Court to after April 3, 2020, delaying Galoustian’s sentencing again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This story will be updated once another date has been set for the sentencing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karapetian said it is expected that he will be sentenced to 18 years in state prison and will have to register as a sex offender for life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mr. Galoustian has taken full responsibility for his conduct,” Leonard B. Levine, Galoustian’s lawyer, said on Wednesday afternoon. He added that Galoustian would accept the court’s sentence “pursuant to the plea agreement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The district attorney’s office had initially charged him with 33 felony counts, which were filed on behalf </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/galoustian-will-face-charges-on-behalf-of-two-victims-during-january-trial/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two victims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Nexus previously reported. He had initially pled not guilty to all the charges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karapetian said that she selected the eight charges for the plea agreement based on the evidence behind each charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The eight charges] reflected his criminal conduct in different ways. Each count he plead guilty to reflected a separate crime he committed on each victim,” </span>Karapetian said in an email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said in an email that the last two counts of criminal threats are “serious felony strike convictions,” meaning that if he commits any “qualifying” felony offenses after his release from prison, “he will be looking at a minimum mandatory sentence of 25 years to life in prison.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UC Santa Barbara class of 2005 alumnus, Galoustian was well-known in the community as a long-time Isla Vista resident and as the owner of iVMenus, a food delivery service. He had operated the business from 2008 up until his arrest; it has since shut down, and the location where it used to operate, 910 Embarcadero Del Norte, has not been occupied since.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was initially arrested on Dec. 18, 2017, for charges relating to the rape of one victim; during the discovery process, prosecutors became aware of a second victim and filed charges on their behalf as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The long duration of the court case has been criticized by Judge James E. Herman, who has primarily been presiding over the case since June 2018. Galoustian switched attorneys during his court case, which is partially why the case has taken so long to litigate, as Levine </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/trial-for-iv-menus-owner-will-begin-in-late-july/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">noted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in March that he needed additional time to go through the evidence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before today’s court appearance, Galoustian had been scheduled to go to trial beginning Jan. 8, 2020. </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [3/17/20 4:24 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated [11:35 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Comer, director of SBC Public Health Microbiology Laboratory,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henning Ansorg, SBC public health officer in the Public Health Department, to elaborate on how the county is responding to the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would like to have everyone tested, but unfortunately, at the moment, we just cannot afford it. I’m looking forward to the next week or 10 days when we have a much better capability [for testing],” Ansorg said. “I urge people to understand that this is not in our hands. Nationwide, there are low shortages of important ingredients in these test kits.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ansorg explained that the county has created a priority tier system for those who need to be currently tested.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Tier 1 are the “most vulnerable,” such as elderly individuals in senior residential facilities and nursing homes, as well as health care workers such as doctors and nurses, whose services are “critical.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tier 2 is composed of severely ill people, cases “where it would make a big difference if they are diagnosed early.” In Tier 3, the lowest category, are people who are “very mildly ill.” Those classified in Tier 3 should isolate themselves until they are fever free for three days, Ansorg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panel members noted they’ve seen a number of questions from community members about how the virus is spread; Batson explained that the coronavirus is transmitted “via droplet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The coronavirus is] unlike other airborne diseases such as measles and tuberculosis that don’t weigh as much … Whenever someone coughs, the droplet can typically only go three feet,” Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That is one of the reasons we are encouraging social distancing because if you stay away from someone who is coughing and the droplet can only go three feet, then it is unlikely you would inhale the infectious droplet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the virus can also be transmitted by touching surfaces, which is why it is important for individuals to continually disinfect surfaces such as doorknobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ansorg said that while currently the county has “more than enough” collection kits to be able to test symptomatic patients, more test kits will be available as “more labs are coming online.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comer clarified that between the Cottage Hospital system and private offices, there are over 1,700 coronavirus testing kits. Van Do-Reynoso said that “to the best of our knowledge, [getting tested] is very affordable because it is free. There is no cost-sharing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you feel like you’re coming down with a sore throat, nasal congestion, a cough, a fever, please consider yourself a potential case. I don’t mean this in order to make people afraid, but take this seriously,” Ansong said. “Do not go to work. Do not mingle with people. Stay isolated and take care of yourself.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [March 17, 2:56 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
