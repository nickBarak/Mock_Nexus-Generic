Senate website by the end of the third week for both winter and spring quarters.</p>\n<p>Ornelas is responsible for making these updates to the website.</p>\n<p>The resolution also says senators should be making a larger effort to expand beyond their personal accounts to provide this information for the student body.</p>\n<p>Ornelas said he drew inspiration for the resolution from UC Berkeley and added that UCSB senator’s accounts would be modeled after those of Berkeley’s senators.</p>\n<p>The requirement of public Facebook pages will be later written into legal code with the senate’s approval, the resolution states.</p>\n<p><i>Aaron Berkness is a reporter at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

primarily caters to Latinx students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (S.T.E.M) majors and operates under the umbrella of the national organization who awarded the group the distinction, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE).</p>\n<p>SHPE has over 250 university chapters in the United States and selected Los Ingenieros due to its accomplishments in “ensuring the post-graduation collegiate success of their members and uplifting their local community,” Karen Siles, the chair of the SHPE National Affairs Committee, said in email.</p>\n<p>Siles also noted that Los Ingenieros has increased their membership by over 40 percent and that they have shown continuous focus on membership recruitment and retention.</p>\n<p>Still, Los Ingenieros isn’t new to recognition — the organization was awarded UCSB’s Student Organization of the Year for the 1998-99, 2001-02, 2008-09 and 2010-11 school years, according to the Los Ingenieros website.</p>\n<p>A main focus of the group is professional development, according to Enrique Guzman, a Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (M.E.S.A.) Program Coordinator and Gaucho alum who advises Los Ingenieros.</p>\n<p>Guzman was a member of the organization in his undergraduate career.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot more people doing internships and research in comparison to my years and a lot more students going to graduate school. The organization’s been growing and evolving with the times,” he said.</p>\n<p>One of Los Ingenieros’ efforts in professional development is the annual Professional Academy for Student Success (P.A.S.S.), a full day of workshops held in partnership with the M.E.S.A. program.</p>\n<p>At P.A.S.S., for example, “we… try to expose our members to the professional world and networking with other students,” Angel Rocha, fourth-year mechanical engineering major and Los Ingenieros president, said.</p>\n<p>In addition, Los Ingenieros works closely with M.E.S.A. in supporting community outreach.</p>\n<p>“One of our main events is Science and Technology M.E.S.A. Day. We bring in 500 middle schoolers and high schoolers to compete in engineering competitions,” Rocha said.</p>\n<p>The program serves local students from sixth to 12th grade.</p>\n<p>The [organization also gives tours and hosts science projects for more than 1,000 high school and middle school students who visit UCSB on school-organized trips per year, according to Micaela Morgan, K-12 programs director and M.E.S.A. director.</p>\n<p>Beyond professional development and community outreach, Los Ingenieros focuses on supporting its members socially and emotionally.</p>\n<p>“Being a S.T.E.M. student is difficult and staying in a S.T.E.M. major can be even more difficult and it is important to have that community where one can tap into,” Guzman said, noting that this is especially true since many of the members of Los Ingenieros are first-generation college students.</p>\n<p>Los Ingenieros partners up younger members with mentors, holds social events and seeks to build a community within the group, according to Rocha.</p>\n<p>“We create a sense of familia, a sense of family.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Jan. 11]: Morgan is the M.E.S.A. director, not coordinator, as stated in a previous version of this article. </em></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.3 of the Jan. 10 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Laila Voss is a reporter at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Shrunken Heads Production Company, a student-run theatre group that organizes various musical performances, will be offering several showtimes throughout the weekend, with performances at Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at Campbell Hall. Sing along to hit rock songs from the musical including  “Aquarius,” “Good Morning Starshine” and “Let the Sunshine In” while following the story of a group of young friends who navigate the trials of everyday life against the backdrop of the military draft and Vietnam War. UCSB Students and military members can get in for free; students can buy tickets for $5.50 and general admission is $10.50.</p>\n<p><strong>Venom</strong></p>\n<p>If you missed it in the theatres, the film “Venom” is coming to Isla Vista Theatre this Tuesday, Jan. 22. UCSB students can enjoy showings either at 7 p.m. or 10 p.m. by showing their ACCESS card at the door. The movie presents an alternative storyline related to the original “Spiderman” in which a journalist by the name of Eddie Brock contracts a mutant organism while investigating the nefarious experiments of scientist Carlton Drake. Brock struggles throughout the movie to control the raging power and superhuman abilities he possesses while trying to prevent Venom from overpowering him. Be sure to bring snacks along with your friends to enjoy the movie in comfort.</p>\n<p><strong>Pajama Party!</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t let the rain keep you indoors this weekend! A couple local bands will brave the storm to perform live music for I.V. residents. Stop by to see Close Out, a three-member punk, reggae, alternative rock band from I.V. and Peach Gazebo, another local band this Friday at 6666 Sueno Rd. Party-goers are encouraged to come dressed in their comfiest onesie or pajamas to dance the night away in style. Peach Gazebo opens the show from 9:20 p.m to 10:20 p.m. and then Close Out will finish out the night from 9:30 p.m. to 12 a.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Shopping in Style </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re one of those people who still don’t use reusable bags when grocery shopping, you’re still in 2018. Update your shopping routine while learning about the latest in zero-waste grocery shopping from staff at the I.V. Food Co-op on 6575 Seville Rd. This upcoming Wednesday, Jan. 23, from 4 to 5:30 p.m., Co-Op Sustainability Coordinator Allison will provide information on how attendees can reduce their “shopping footprint.” The workshop includes tastings of zero-waste recipes as well as raffles to win reusable water bottles and containers.

UCSB also ranked second highest in the UC system for most African-American student applications.</p>\n<p>According to Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services Mary Jacob, the university’s 85,208 applications reflect a larger amount of non-California applicants than ever before, with 18,420 of the applications coming from out-of-state and international students.</p>\n<p>“We continue to attract students from outside California, from other states in the United States,  and even from other countries abroad,” Jacob said. “There’s interest outside of California from people who would like to study here and study specifically at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Jacob said 10,930 of the non-California applications were from international students, exceeding the 7,490 out-of-state applications. She said this is due to the U.S.’s greater availability of higher education in comparison to universities and colleges abroad which tend to be more competitive.</p>\n<p>“American students, no matter where they are, have a range of choices of good quality universities to apply to in the same country, and that may not always be the case for other countries,” Jacob said. “It’s too competitive for them to go to the really good universities in their home country, so they look to study abroad in the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia or Canada if they’re looking to go to an English-speaking country.”</p>\n<p>UCOP spokesperson Shelly Meron said despite California residents’ criticism of UCOP for increasing acceptance of non-Californians, these acceptances are financially necessary as higher out-of-state tuition will allow the UC to provide funding for resident students amidst recent state budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“Admitting non-resident students helps UC subsidize California students and make up for some of the significant cuts in state funding the university has experienced in the last few years,” Meron said. “It’s also important to note that non-resident students are not taking the place of California students at UC; these are separate enrollment targets.”</p>\n<p>Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships Michael M. Miller said the amount of financial aid students receive will not be affected significantly by the larger pool of applicants, as the university will continue to enroll a consistent number of students to allow the university to properly fund them.</p>\n<p>“The campus is really good about hitting all our enrollment targets,” Miller said. “So while enrollment may fluctuate by a couple hundred students here or there, for the most part we know how many students we’re going to have and we can effectively fund them with financial aid. It’s not that big of a deal for financial aid.”</p>\n<p>According to Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop, the increasing number of applicants allows the university to select more academically adept students, leading to an increase in the value of a UCSB degree in the job and graduate school market.</p>\n<p>“The academic prestige of the campus will continue to rise high and you’ll see more high-achieving students in our classrooms,” Przekop said. “It means the value of your UCSB degree will continue to rise as you begin your career and/or apply to graduate programs.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said the only downside accompanying the increase in applicants is that the university will have to deny more students.</p>\n<p>“Competition for admission to UCSB will increase,” Przekop said. “Unfortunately, excellent applicants will be denied admission. It never feels good to deny access to wonderful applicants.”</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, the increase in applications can be attributed to the university’s growing public relations efforts, including an increased social media presence, a recently added virtual campus tour to the admissions website and the presence of more visits from California high schools and community colleges than in the previous year.</p>\n<p>“We have been more visible and active in our California outreach efforts,” Przekop said. “This fall we visited approximately 100 more schools in California than last year.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said the greater number of applicants can also be accredited to the university’s recognition worldwide, helped in part by recent Nobel Prize for Physics recipient Shuji Nakamura.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is recognized by top student scholars as a world-class university,” Przekop said. “We have a new Nobel Prize winner, which certainly drew global attention.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he attributes the record amount of applications to the university’s highly ranked education, prominent diversity, effective research and faculty.</p>\n<p>“This year’s record number of applications is a testament to UC Santa Barbara’s stature as a world leader in academic excellence and diversity, cutting-edge research and innovative teaching,” Yang said. “We are proud to be a campus of choice for talented and high-achieving students with diverse backgrounds who enrich our community.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, January 15, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/","id":2941,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2940,2939,2938],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
