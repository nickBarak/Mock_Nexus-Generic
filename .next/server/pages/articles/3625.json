None of the three assailants have been found.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit alleges that the UCSB Police Department was “understaffed and insufficiently trained” and says UCSB “did not reach out to a better equipped law enforcement agency to assist with the investigation and management of the case.”</p>\n<p>The student, who is referred to as Jane Doe, believes the assailants were familiar with the specific location because of the direct route they took from I.V. to the hidden area, according to the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>After several hours, the student, who began school at UCSB in 2012, was able to escape from the three men. She was recorded on a security camera at around 4 a.m. running back to her residence in I.V., where her roommate called police and medical personnel.</p>\n<p>The victim was then transported to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital where a rape kit was performed, but the lawsuit says the rape kit is “missing significant documentation including photos of her significant injuries.”</p>\n<p>As a result of the attack, the student’s eyes were swollen shut, her nose was broken and she suffered blunt trauma to her knees, hands and abdomen, according to the lawsuit. The student also contracted herpes from one of the attackers and had to take preemptive anti-HIV medication, although the lawsuit does not say she contracted the virus.</p>\n<p>The student is requesting damages from the university for personal injury, negligence related to the premises of the university and both intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Although the lawsuit does not specify the amount of money requested from the university, it states that when figures are known, the plaintiff will “amend this Complaint and allege said amounts.”</p>\n<p>A full copy of the lawsuit was <span style=\"color: red;\"><a href=\"http://www.keyt.com/blob/view/-/37650938/data/2/-/10fupes/-/Rape-Case-Complaint-Against-UC-Regents.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">made available by KEYT</a></span><span style=\"color: windowtext;\">.</span></p>\n<p>An initial case management conference is scheduled for May 27 in front of Judge Donna Geck, according to the Santa Barbara Superior Court <span style=\"color: red;\"><a href=\"http://www.sbcourts.org/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a></span>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Unusually high demand for housing has made it nearly impossible for students to find housing in Isla Vista, Goleta and even downtown Santa Barbara. Some students have resorted to staying in costly motels while they await assistance from the Community Housing Office (CHO), the university administration responsible for helping students find living accommodations.</p>\n<p>According to Community Housing Office Manager Roane Akchurin, in her 25 years of working with the CHO she could only recall one other year with a similar housing shortage situation, which was in 1989. According to Akchurin, approximately 100 students are still without housing, a shortage that did not become apparent to the CHO until a month ago.</p>\n<p>“It seemed like a normal year,” Akchurin said, “I’ve been here 25 years, up until August, then right when September hit we started getting phone calls from international students saying housing was tighter than usual.”</p>\n<p>Akchurin said the housing crunch has been the result of a multitude of factors outside of the University’s control.</p>\n<p>“It’s a way bigger issue than just UCSB,” Akchurin said. “There’s City College and Westmont students that impact the market place, as well as an influx of construction contractors working in Goleta that have added to the housing shortage.”</p>\n<p>According to Akchurin, her office has reached out to the broader community to provide housing for many afflicted students.</p>\n<p>“We sent a letter to local folks to ask people to come forward and provide housing, and the response has been amazing,” Aktchurin said. “The community has been great.”</p>\n<p>However, students like fourth-year international business major Daniel Luckyman remain homeless.

President Ali Guthy and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young. The event culminated in a surprise appearance and performance by UCSB alumni and rock musicians Jack Johnson and Animal Liberation Orchestra.</p>\n<p>As the first person to speak at the event, Guthy said “Come Together” was organized in order to honor the memories of six members of “our UCSB family,” — George Chen, Katherine Cooper, James Hong, Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, David Wang and Veronika Weiss — by remembering them while moving forward with efforts to improve the UCSB and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“As a new academic year has begun and we being to focus on the hopes, goals and dreams that lie ahead, we remember them,” Guthy said. “As we take those moments out of our busy day to cherish what it means to be a Gaucho and part of an extraordinary, caring family, we remember them.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, who said he still has “difficulty wrapping [his] head around making sense out of the senseless acts of violence,” of May 23, “Come Together” was formed in order to encourage students to define and determine the character and quality of the UCSB and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“You students individually and collectively have the ability to make Isla Vista and UCSB the kind of community that is not only extraordinarily beautiful and fun but also safe and healthy,” Young said. “I urge you to seize this moment and begin the important but hard difficult work of reclaiming and rebuilding our community. We got this.”</p>\n<p>After Young and Guthy spoke, Johnson and ALO musically collaborated, giving students a free performance for over an hour and a half. Throughout playing songs such as “Good People,” “Better Together” and “Banana Pancakes,” Johnson and ALO members commented on their time spent in Santa Barbara and reminisced on the fond memories they associate with their former life in I.V.</p>\n<p><em>A photo essay related to this article can be found <a

California’s postdoctoral scholars voted overwhelmingly to ratify a one-year agreement with the University between Oct. 19 and 27, ending long and sometimes tense negotiations between the UC postdoc union (UAW 5810) and the UC.</p>\n<p>The agreement, which instates yearly raises, increases health care coverage and loosens restrictions on international postdocs, was ratified by 98.8 percent of postdocs in a count of 3,471 to 42. Negotiations came down to the last hour on Oct. 1, with postdocs threatening to strike. After having to extend the previous contract to Oct. 9, the two sides reached a new one-year contract which the union ultimately ratified Oct. 27.</p>\n<p>The union, which represents more than 6,000 postdocs at all UC campuses, charged the University with “bad faith bargaining” and “refusing to provide the Union with information” necessary for negotiations in a document submitted Sept. 18 to California’s Public Employment Relations Board.</p>\n<p>Although the union never actually went on strike, president of the postdoc union Anke Schennink said she believes the threat of a strike led to concessions from UC negotiators who were “definitely aware” of the strike.</p>\n<p>“[The strike] was not mentioned at the bargaining table itself, but it came up in conversations in the hallway,” Schennink said. “We were willing to go on strike, and we were willing to prepare for that if the University hadn’t made any moves towards us.”</p>\n<p>Director of the UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program Mark Lawson said the agreement is an “accomplishment” for both sides.</p>\n<p>“I think it is important to look at the big picture and be happy that the UC and the postdoc representation are able to come to an agreement,” Lawson said in an email.</p>\n<p>The previous deal had run for three years, and Schennink said the new one-year contract means the union is already preparing for next year’s negotiations.</p>\n<p>“We have already started making plans and are already working on our strategy for next year,” Schennink said. “There is really no plan to relax.”</p>\n<p>The one-year time frame also allows the University and the union to get right to work on issues where there is common ground, according to Schennink.</p>\n<p>“We made some improvements and they are important, but there are also some other improvements that both sides wanted to see, definitely in terms of gender equity and childcare reimbursements,” Schennink said. “With a one-year contract, more post-docs will have more opportunity to participate and express their views and say what’s important.”</p>\n<p>Schennink said female postdocs face additional difficulties, referring to a UC Berkeley professor who was accused of kissing and groping female students against their will.</p>\n<p>“As a postdoc, you are in a lot of ways dependent on your professor,” Schennink said. “A professor in your postdoc can make or break your career.”</p>\n<p>In October, Schennink said members of the negotiating team “don’t respect postdocs.” When asked if that is still the case, she said the new contract would not immediately change that feeling.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that changes in a month or in a couple of months,” Schennink said. “I think this takes years, given how lengthy the process was for bargaining … and how ridiculous and absurd the University’s comments were.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara unit chair for the union and postdoctoral fellow in UCSB’s materials department Patrick Callahan said he voted for the deal and expected it to pass.</p>\n<p>“I did expect [the vote] to be about as overwhelming as it was,” Callahan said. “We didn’t really lose anything so I’m not really surprised.”</p>\n<p>Callahan said while other postdocs would benefit from the contract, his job would not change much, if at all.</p>\n<p>“One of the things we were really fighting for was protections for international postdocs, but I’m not an international postdoc so that doesn’t really affect me,” Callahan said. “I don’t expect things to change for me, but for other people I’m sure it will make some difference.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
