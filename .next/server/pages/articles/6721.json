It is an influential, forward-moving scene and a genre that has seeped into countless others. Many Top 40 hits of the past decade wouldn’t have existed without the influence of electronic music. And yes, the Isla Vista music scene as we know it today wouldn’t exist without it, either.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is difficult to trace the genesis of an entire music scene in any community, especially when you consider something as vague as the  “electronic” label. There isn’t any particular strain of electronica that is unique to Isla Vista — walking down the street on a Friday night, you’ll encounter dubstep, house and all of the other niche sounds in between. These sounds are integral to our infamous party scene, and they provide the soundtrack for many weekend experiences, from the smallest house parties to the most ridiculous fraternity ragers. Despite this, however, most of the live music that one can experience in I.V. is confined to the realm of guitar music. There is not much by the way of live deejay sets, which is actually surprising considering the diverse community of musicians residing in Isla Vista. But at one time, electronica was dominating the live I.V. music scene. In fact, one of our most famous alumni is Steve Aoki, world-famous musician, deejay and record producer, and the roots of Aoki’s chart-topping career can be traced back to Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1996, the then-college student started throwing shows in his two story apartment located on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde, later known affectionately as the Pickle Patch. This infamous, residential music venue and part-time living room was home to a plethora of live shows featuring artists like Jimmy Eat World and At the Drive In.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Aoki was merely 19, he was throwing roughly 20 shows a month out of his living room, recording tapes of every single one. The artist once noted that he made around 400 individual recordings during that time. It was also from the Pickle Patch that Aoki founded his record label, Dim Mak. Now 21 years old, Dim Mak has promoted artists ranging from Bloc Party to The Kills and is host to a roster packed with newcomers such as Keys N Krates.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78734\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Take-home-issue-graphic.....jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1590461283\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78733\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78734\" data-attachment-id=\"78734\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/aoki-electronica-and-the-live-i-v-music-scene/take-home-issue-graphic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Take-home-issue-graphic.....jpg?fit=2048%2C1638&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1638\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Take home issue graphic….\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Take-home-issue-graphic.....jpg?fit=250%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Take-home-issue-graphic.....jpg?fit=888%2C710&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78734 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Take-home-issue-graphic.....jpg?resize=888%2C710\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"710\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Take-home-issue-graphic.....jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Take-home-issue-graphic.....jpg?resize=250%2C200&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Take-home-issue-graphic.....jpg?resize=768%2C614&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Take-home-issue-graphic.....jpg?resize=1024%2C819&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Take-home-issue-graphic.....jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78734\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important, however, to note that the shows that Aoki produced were not electronic. During that period of time, the genre wasn’t a mainstay in music, and it was barely putting down roots in underground scenes. The long-haired music mastermind was a punk aficionado back in those days, organizing shows at the popular housing co-op Biko. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biko, located on the 66 Block of Sueno, is known for its role in campus activism and strengthening diversity in the I.V. network of housing co-ops. Aoki was a student of color at UCSB when the concept of diversity was way more of a question and concern than it is now. However, a student of color organizing hardcore rock shows would be something slightly out of the ordinary even in the present. Although it is not clear whether his focus on electronic music endeavors heightened before or after UCSB, his influence on the Isla Vista rock scene is undeniable, and the world-famous DJ still maintains a punk rock performance ethic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you attend a Steve Aoki show, you are there expecting at least one thing: cake. His performances have become infamous because of his habit of throwing full, frosted sheet cakes into the audience. This carefree, slightly reckless approach to performing is something that can still be found in the ethos of Isla Vista backyard show culture. There is still a clear emphasis on letting go, getting pushed to the front of the crowd and getting a little messy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2010, Aoki returned to Isla Vista for a show in the Hub, organized by A.S. Program Board. It was free of charge and sold out very quickly as word moved across campus that one of our own would be returning to grace the stage. He said to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “My expectations are all over the place, I didn’t realize that it was going to sell out. It’s cool to hear that, of course.” Indeed it was, no matter how nonchalantly the then-almost superstar tried to play it off. It is important to note that this was a year when electronic music in the mainstream was taking off in a major way, signaling a turn of the decade trend. Electronic music influences began to creep their way ever so subtly into pop, alternative and hip-hop, and it barely created a fuss. Now electronic music is not merely a trend, but a phenomenon across the country, including in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the live music scene privileges guitar music over basically everything else, there is a strong love for electronica that flows through the veins of Isla Vista. Almost any significant party or event is bound to feature tracks with a bass drop, which is welcomed, loved, and expected. Aoki is one of many Isla Vista musicians who has gone on to do things beyond the single square mile radius of our beloved town, but he is one of the few that had an unmistakable mark on its culture.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1706.jpeg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/zoejones/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Zoe Jones</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Zoë has been an Artsweek Editor since the 2016-17 school year and enjoys it much more than she lets on.

I came across concertgoer Dorothy Tang near the front of the stage and asked if she was prepared to mosh her heart out, responding by pointing at her five inch black heeled boots and saying, “These shoes weren’t made for moshing, but I’m ready to head-bang my heart away on the side!” This show was a prime example of concerts bringing complete strangers together, creating a safe space where chaos and camaraderie can coexist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three opening acts had brief sets before The Garden was scheduled to take the stage, reminiscent of a Beach Goth-esque festival setting. The second opening act Heyrocco brought forth a Nirvana atmosphere to the stage, building up to a grunge momentum and emitting songs about the never-ending wave of sadness found in a teen’s heart. Heyrocco’s union of engaging lyricism and thrilling instrumentation amplified the intensity of the purple-lit Velvet Jones. Once The Garden hit the stage, Wyatt Shears transfixed a laser-like focus on channeling a spastic diorama of sound. The bleak lyrics provided an addition to the polyrhythmic precision as Wyatt repeatedly yelled out, “I like cereal, but I’m not a serial killer.” The Garden does not rely on impressive theatrics nor grandiose stage backgrounds to get the crowd entranced, hyped up and sweating profusely on each other. During the performance of the track “All Smiles Over Here,” the crowd turned into a maelstrom of failed stage dives, checkered Vans flying in the air and Wyatt handing the mic to ecstatic fans so they could shout out the chorus. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Midway during the set, the sonic distortion escaping from Wyatt’s buoyant vocals in “Crystal Clear” created a journey of sensory annihilation. The bass riffs combined with Fletcher’s thunderous drumming when performing the single “Egg,” displayed The Garden’s stylistically diverse dynamic. The audience reciprocated the same chaotic energy that The Garden put into their performance, creating a symbiotic relationship between fans and the band. The eager fans erupted in a rage for an encore, pleading for one final song to draw the night to a close. Fletcher and Wyatt responded to their dire calls and performed “I’m A Woman,” an ode to the twins’ ability to defy gender roles. A realization hit the audience that perhaps The Garden’s songs were meant to be sung together, in a space where everyone feels at ease and accepted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crowd dispersed toward the entrance of Velvet Jones, people lit their cigarettes with sweat shining from their foreheads and exchanged words about Wyatt’s spontaneous dance moves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sum up the show, second-year Chloe Anderson said, “The night was fun and interesting, but most of it consisted of me desperately trying to avoid getting caught and trampled in a giant mosh pit.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Garden provided a show composed of unbridled energy, innate eccentricity and polite fans offering a helping hand to anyone who dropped on the floor during the escalated moshing intervals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shears twins don’t adhere to any guidelines, rules  or preconceptions — they embody their own conceptual style of music. Their music is centered on having free reign on creative landscapes and being able to illustrate a panel of alluring emotions through the medium of unconventional sounds. In The Garden’s world, there is no focus on wanting to fit in with what is deemed to be cool in the punk scene. They dare to defy gender roles, genre molds and the tangents of normality.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74161\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74161\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/","id":6718,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6717,6716,6715],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Morrissey Lights Santa Barbara Aglow for Dia de Los Muertos","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/morissey.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/morissey.jpg?resize=699%2C578&ssl=1","description":"As I passed a group of sequin-clad skeletons savaging a Donald Trump piñata, something occurred to me: Morrissey couldn’t have picked a better event to play.

On Saturday, the plainly commercial space of the Santa Barbara Bowl was awash in a tide of local culture, and the walkway up from the front gate to the concert stage was transformed into a vertical street festival. Altars dedicated to lost loved ones flickered under the candlelight, and stray flower petals seemed to dance aloft on the voices and hands of missing friends. Tributes to fallen idols were in abundance; I teared up a little as I passed two candy skulls painted in the likenesses of David Bowie and Prince. Our own KCSB even had a small shrine dedicated to the programmers that have passed on over the years. In a patio area halfway up the slope, as I passed a group of sequin-clad skeletons savaging a Donald Trump piñata, something occurred to me: Morrissey couldn’t have picked a better event to play.<br>\nAs I stood in the pit waiting for Moz, music videos and movie clips lit up a gigantic projector screen behind the stage. The mixture of Sex Pistols, New York Dolls, James Dean and Cher made it immediately clear that these had been selected by the man himself. When he finally did take the stage along with a band of dashing young skeleton men in shirtless tuxedos, the crowd responded like drought victims in a rainstorm. He immediately dove into “How Soon Is Now?” and the tremolo set us all rippling. It was a smart call for the opening song, as the dominant sentiment in the audience was something along the lines of, “I’d throw myself in front of a bus for Steven Patrick Morrissey, but he had better play some goddamn Smiths tunes.” Alyssa, a senior at Cal Poly, echoed these sentiments after the show saying she was, “very stoked on him, but he was a bit of a tease. I [wanted] more Smiths.”<br>\nAfter the cheering died down, he quipped, “I sure hope you all enjoy yourselves, because you’re all royally screwed come Tuesday.”  A Cheshire grin flashed across his face as the crowd erupted once more. Mozmania had officially set in, and he could now say essentially anything he wished.  Luckily he (usually) uses this power for good, and after a couple of songs the charming man paused, and the screen behind him lit up once more.  As he sung the opening lines of “Ganglord,” harrowing scenes of police brutality played out behind him. Men in riot gear dashed people’s heads against walls and shot dogs in the street, and the number of fists raised around me made it clear these scenes were all too familiar to the crowd. A round of sober applause sounded out as the last image of an officer smiling behind a riot mask faded to black.<br>\nMorrissey was quick to liven up the audience again, starting up with a cover of the Ramones’ “Judy Is a Punk” leading into “You’re the One For Me, Fatty” and “Ouija Board,” two of his solo classics.  Afterward, he performed several of his newer songs, and I admit the show might’ve lagged (musically) at this point. However, Mozzer’s signature brand of animal magnetism seemed to carry us all through the middle. The entire time, eager fans attempted to catapult themselves onstage only to be intercepted mid-flight by a group of expert bouncers. One man in a full skeleton costume was able to make it all the way and gave Morrissey a tender bear hug before a baldheaded man in a polo shirt sprang like a puma from stage right and whisked him away.<br>\nBefore the set’s finale, the Irish crooner took the time to thank his band, whom he described as “the best platoon from here to the moon.” They all bowed reverently and then polished off the crowd with “Everyday Is Like Sunday” and “First of the Gang to Die.” Morrissey’s dulcet tones were drowned out by a chorus of tearful voices, but not a soul complained. He gave the crowd a coy wave as he and the band left the stage, everyone in attendance knowing full well that the pause before the encore was mere formality. In another calculated move, Moz finished with the raucous Smiths tune “What She Said,” making a heady and frenzied end to the performance. As I walked back down past all of the altars, candles now blown out, I knew that Morrissey had done right by the spirit of the Day of the Dead. He’d awoken a light in all those watching that would never go out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74106\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74106\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/","id":6719,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6718,6717,6716],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"First Lady of Folk Joan Baez Sparkles at Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=306%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=306%2C306&ssl=1","description":"For the past 50 years, Baez — a dedicated social activist — has explored forms of social expression through her music.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Lights dim, spotlights focus and she steps on stage, donning a “Nasty Woman” T-shirt, a red bandana scarf and a smile that prompts thunderous applause. At 75 years old, Joan Baez appears as effortlessly cool as she did when she rose to fame in the 1960s as the next great American troubadour. Now, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award holder and Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Nominee, Baez continues her contemporary folk rock legacy, most recently performing at downtown Santa Barbara’s Arlington Theatre. There’s no question that Baez’s command of the stage is nothing short of powerful, for after a quick greeting, she strums her guitar, allowing the entire room to melt into its seats, a collective release of tension.<br>\nBaez led with a rendition of the song “Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word” by the musician she helped bring to fame, Bob Dylan. She joked that she would sing a few Dylan songs in light of it being “Bob Dylan appreciation month,” referencing his recent Nobel Prize in Literature. Vocally, Baez fluctuates between her signature soprano trill and a mature, light, husky tone. The familiar tune prompted many audience members who had come with their significant others to cuddle up to her sweet and sentimental serenade.<br>\nJoining her onstage was her band, who appropriately entered wearing “Bad Hombre” T-shirts to accompany Baez’s own wardrobe, which was the first of many 2016 election references of the night. The team consists of Dirk Powell, who played a variety of stringed instruments throughout the show, and Baez’s only son, Gabriel Harris, who provided percussion. “Turns out she can sing,” Baez said of her personal assistant, Grace Stumberg, whom she also invited on stage to accompany her through backing vocals and little duets. The talented bunch even did so well as to steal the spotlight from Baez at times, especially in the case of Stumberg, whose impressive belt brought a modern complexity to the music.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74110\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1436783336\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74109\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74110\" data-attachment-id=\"74110\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/3523-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?fit=306%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"306,306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"3523-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?fit=306%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-74110\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Arts and lectures\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3523-1.jpg?w=306&amp;ssl=1 306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Arts and Lectures</p></div>\n<p>Kathryn Krebs, a Santa Barbara local, reminisces “[going] to the county Bowl when the lawn seats were $5. I saw her when she played for Cesar Chavez and the farmworkers.” Another audience member, Martha Donovan, expressed her love for the song “Deportee,” claiming, “It’s so appropriate now.” Baez, who is of Mexican descent, obviously agreed, as she placed heavy importance on the song before performing it. Her version is touching, tender and a perfect example of how her music immediately impacts the audience, as it left Donovan dabbing tears from her eyes. Powell, Baez’s accompanist, targeted the crowd, mentioning that if the song strongly resonated with anyone, he urges them to vote in the upcoming election. In particular, he promoted his stepmother, Joan Hartmann, who was recently elected Third District County Santa Barbara supervisor.<br>\nBaez, whose setlist flows through personal anecdotes of her journey to musical recognition or her social activism, continued with songs such as “Prison Trilogy,” which she penned when her then-boyfriend, David Harris, who was arrested for resisting draft in 1969. Today, the song continues to hold significance to Baez as she revealed her tour is in conjunction with the Innocence Project, a program that, according to its website, “exonerates the wrongly convicted through DNA testing and reforms the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice.” Baez even recounted the inspiration she drew from visiting a man who had recently been acquitted after 28 years in prison and his outlook on life. “He’s not bitter,” she said before claiming that it’s cases like those that call us to, as the song says, “raze the prisons to the ground.”<br>\nShe went on to perform many favorites such as “She Could Never Resist A Winding Road,” “Me and Bobby McGee” and “Do Right Woman, Do Right Man.” Her most stunning part of the set, however, was the haunting “Diamonds and Rust,” an entirely dark acoustic performance, set in front of an ethereal and foggy background that left me with chills down my spine. Baez, who seems to find the humor in all of her music, tweaked the end of the song by adding, with a devious twinkle in her eye, “if you’re offering me diamonds and rust … Well, I’ll take the diamonds,” before nonchalantly taking a sip of tea, as the audience roared with cheers and laughter.<br>\nAs the concert progressed, it became obvious that for many, Baez’s music brings forth a collection of memories of youth and rebellion. The messages of the music, while more common nowadays, were themes that began a revolution for many of the adults that sat in the theater that night. “I grew up with Joan Baez. She represents all of the angst of growing up,” Krebs affirmed. Donovan added, “I first saw her in eighth grade. I snuck into this little club in Los Angeles, and I remember thinking, ‘We need more people like that in our world.’” Others discovered identity and individuality through the music. Debra Stanfield, who saw Baez live for the first time that night, talked about how Baez helped “develop what [she] believed about society.” Adding to her sentiments, Stanfield concludes that Baez influenced her as a person, because her songs “related to the needs that people had. I’m a psychotherapist, so I guess I found some personal meaning from her.”<br>\nTo round off the night, Baez answered the demand for an encore with a rendition of the traditional gospel standard “Swing Low Sweet Chariot.” The stage was a modern echo of her famous performance of the song at the legendary 1969 Woodstock festival. Likewise, the Arlington Theatre was transported to a dimension of nothing but “peace and music.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74109\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74109\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/first-lady-of-folk-joan-baez-sparkles-at-arlington/","id":6720,"author":{"id":709,"name":"Tamara Luechinger"},"related":[6719,6718,6717],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
