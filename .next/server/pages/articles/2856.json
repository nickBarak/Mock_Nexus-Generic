Officers reported the male caller to have said in the voice mail, “I’ll kill you and kick your ass.” He followed by more name-calling and said, “If you don’t settle down, you will lose your job.”</p>\n<p>The supervisor suspects the caller to be one of the students with whom he had a confrontation in the weight room last week. During this incident, the supervisor confronted two male students who were using weights unsafely and they responded with verbal hostility.</p>\n<p>Detectives are still following up on the students that the RecCen supervisor thinks might be responsible.</p>\n<p>Signs of Intoxication</p>\n<p>Saturday, Oct. 2, 2:16 a.m.: UCPD officers responded to reports of a man in the median of El Colegio Rd. near the Santa Ynez Apartments hitting road signs with a four- to five-foot pole. When officers arrived at the scene, they found two men walking in the median toward Francisco Torres, hitting road signs with poles. Officers spoke to the men and determined that they were intoxicated.</p>\n<p>Both men were arrested for public intoxication and sent to Santa Barbara County Jail pending sobriety. The road signs were checked but found to have sustained no significant damage from the poles.</p>\n<p>Cheech and Chong</p>\n<p>Friday, Oct. 1, 1:17 p.m.: Officers were stationed at the intersection of Pardall Rd. and Embarcadero del Norte to watch for seatbelt violations. Officers spotted the male driver and passenger of one passing vehicle hurriedly putting their seatbelts on. The vehicle was stopped for questioning and officers discovered that stereo equipment was being illegally sold out of the vehicle without a permit.</p>\n<p>While the entrepreneurs were being warned about the possible consequences of their illegal sales, the officers noticed a marijuana pipe in plain view on the center console of the car. A search of the vehicle revealed the driver to be in possession of marijuana and a suspended license.</p>\n<p>Officers seized the marijuana and the driver of the vehicle was cited for driving with a suspended license, driving without a seat belt and possession of marijuana. </p>\n<p>– Compiled by Lindsey Miller</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-7967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-7967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2004-10-08/ucpd-police-blotter/","id":2856,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[2855,2854,2853],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell","biography":"Not available","articles":[1284,3495,3499,3521,3528,3569,3575,3577,3578,3580,3809,3810,3834,3836,3837,3838,3840],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Positions to be filled include President, Internal Vice President (IVP), External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA), External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), Student Advocate General (SAG) and off-campus and on-campus senators.</p>\n<p>Third-year history of public policy major running for A.S. President with OPP Jimmy Villareal said one major project he was involved with last year was a general poll that allowed students to give input to A.S.</p>\n<p>“An effort that I was kind of a part of was the Associated Students strategic plan, and that was basically something I did last year,” Villareal said. “We took surveys from over 1,800 students, kind of asked them what they wanted to see from us, what does A.S. do well, what does A.S. not do well, how can we improve and what do they want to see from us in the future.”</p>\n<p>According to Villareal, his main goal is to anticipate and cater to the wants and needs of the student body.</p>\n<p>“That’s really what I want to focus on, is what kind of services we’re providing for the students, how can we take the services that we had already and make them better,” Villareal said. “How can we be more efficient with those, and how can we identify things that students really want, that we aren’t providing already, and find a way to do that and make it feasible.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running for A.S. President with FTP Jason Garshfield said he is running in order to provide students with an option to choose a candidate that is “a little closer to the average students and their wants and needs.”</p>\n<p>“I want the students to have a choice this year. I think it’s disappointing that there’s only one political party and I thought that to remedy that situation I would run,” Garshfield said. “I haven’t been building up my resume for three years and I think that makes me a unique candidate, as opposed to people who have been devoting themselves to A.S. and don’t really have any other interests.”</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, he would place greater importance on protecting students’ rights as opposed to forcing his agenda on them.</p>\n<p>“I think the changes that I implement would be a subtraction rather than addition because I think that ultimately my job as A.S. president is not to force my agenda on the students. My agenda is to protect the fundamental rights of the students and to treat everyone as an individual,” Garshfield said. “If that involves subtracting some things from the office and subtracting the power of the president, then I will definitely do whatever’s in my power to do so.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major running for IVP with OPP Kimia Hashemian said she wants to bring back a system called Gaucho Rewards in order to increase student participation at university and Isla Vista events.</p>\n<p>“It’s a program to increase attendance to the different events we have on campus,” Hashemian said. “Go to a sports game and get 50 points, if you go to town hall you get 100 points, and these points can be redeemed for cost-free things, such as going up Storke tower, or having lunch with the A.S. president, something like that.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major running for EVPLA with OPP Paola De La Cruz said her main focus would be to address issues concerning housing, sexual assault and community building on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am running because I want to improve the quality of life of students in Isla Vista, and really voice concerns and experiences that I went through,” De La Cruz said. “I really want to work towards creating some temporary housing on campus; then for sexual assault I want to develop and execute a campaign to battle sexual assault in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running for EVPLA with FTP Brandon Morse said medical marijuana dispensaries in I.V. could be beneficial in generating revenue for self-governance and other community-based purposes.</p>\n<p>“I think the one thing we’re missing out on is revenue streams as far as the cannabis industry,” Morse said. “I think that there are a substantial number of medical cannabis patients in the Isla Vista area, and the fact that we don’t have immediate safe access for patients is a travesty, and it is also something that we’re lacking as far as a potential revenue source to be able to support things like self-governance.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies major running independently for EVPSA Mohsin Mirza said he hopes to address the issue that “the cost of school is going up while the quality is going down.”</p>\n<p>“I am running because we’re at a crossroads right now in higher education. The cost of school is going up but our quality is going down,” Mirza said. “As part of my platform I’ve got several things. The first is mobilize students against the tuition hike through educational actions leading to actions to put pressure on the governor to fund the UC’s more.”</p>\n<p>Third-year anthropology major running as EVPSA with OPP Carlos Lopez said he wants to better inform students about student debt and budgeting to better involve students in discussions involving tuition increases.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I did in my second year was I put on a weeklong event called the week of revenue. It talked about student debt, how student debt has risen in the last years, and a couple of things that we can try to fight the rising and tuition,” Lopez said. “So I’m hoping to have something every single quarter to try to engage students more.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running independently for SAG Jorge Escobar said few people know about the SAG office, and publicizing their service would be one of his priorities.</p>\n<p>“The office of the Student Advocate General is relatively new, people don’t know us, but we’re a great resource on campus,” Escobar said. “One thing we want to work on is solidifying the office, making sure that we progress. We’re still learning, we want to be able to utilize our resources better.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major running independently for SAG Anais Zavala said the office gives advice and helps students with “anything that has to do with campus policies.”</p>\n<p>“If you get written up in the dorms, plagiarize, break a student code of conduct, we know what to refer you to or we can just give you advice on what to do,” Zavala said. “That’s something that I’m really familiar with, and I’d just like to let people know more about our office.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/","id":2853,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2852,2851,2850],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Note-Taking Tool in the Works","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students’ Office of the Controller is currently conducting research on how to improve student information gathering in the classroom through a new collaborative note-taking program.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_54246\" style=\"width: 834px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MyLastLecture_Vandenbelt.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"995623800\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61385\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54246\" data-attachment-id=\"54246\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/curiouser-and-curiouser-last-lecturer-shares-his-story/mylastlecture_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MyLastLecture_Vandenbelt.jpeg?fit=1498%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1498,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Peter Vandenbelt VBDphotos.com\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1393445111\",\"copyright\":\"Peter R.

The research has taken place in several academic subjects including sociology and communication over the course of 11 total lectures.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year electrical engineering major and A.S. controller Amir Khazaieli, research is still in its experimental stage but the goal of A.S. is to eventually offer a medium that would allow one to become more engaged with their lectures.</p>\n<p>“This is a very, very extensive project that has been in the works for over a year,” Khazaieli said. “Half of it is just providing new tools in lecture to gather information. The other half of it is to provide an interface for students to be able to collaboratively edit and review this information.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said while the Google Doc program is still in its “inception” phase, the program offers a wide variety of benefits to students.</p>\n<p>“The notes that come out of this kind of situation have proven to be a lot more complete, in the sense that a lot more thought-driven analysis goes into what they’re [students are] hearing rather than trying to frantically copy and paste everything that’s said,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>However, classics professor Helen Morales said she prohibits A.S. from passing out flyers promoting the program outside her Greek Mythology lecture because the program allegedly violates UC policy on lecture material distribution.</p>\n<p>“In a nutshell, the A.S. shared note-taking initiative breaks UC Policy 102.23 which expressly forbids students from recording lectures or discussions and from distributing or selling lecture notes and all other course materials without the prior written permission of the instructor,” Morales said in an email.</p>\n<p>Morales said the initiative seemed a lot like <em>studysoup.com</em> and other online initiatives which sell lecture notes to students.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line for me is that students who use them don’t do as well as students who don’t use them,” Morales said. “It’s important to realize that the process of taking notes during lectures is as important as the notes themselves. … So I think that this initiative encourages students not to take their own notes.”</p>\n<p>According to Khazaieli however, the research A.S. is doing is legal and unlike other online note-sharing programs Morales mentioned.</p>\n<p>“I think some people are equating what we are doing with other services that get students to upload lecture slides, content and notes, which they sell to other people to make money,” Khazaieli said. “This is not what is being done at all.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said the note-taking program would only allow access codes within the course to access the document if the program is introduced as an option for lecture attendees.“In order to access the Google Doc you need to get the unique link that we would pass out as you’re walking into class, so it ensures you have to be in class to first access the Google Doc, and then it’s taken down afterwards,” Khazaieli said. “It would also be moderated, so anybody who is not actively participating will be kicked off. So it’s not like you can access it and not take notes.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli also said the note-taking program’s collaborative nature is not breaking UC policy because it will give all students an equal opportunity to contribute to the Google Doc.</p>\n<p>“We would not be taking lecture content and lecture slides,” Khazaieli said. “Its student’s interpretations and what they’ve heard. The only difference between this and taking paper notes is that this is online.”</p>\n<p>According to Khazaieli, the A.S. Office of the Controller is in the process of finding the best way to implement the program to make it as easily accessible and function as possible.</p>\n<p>“It’s been about doing more controlled research tests to figure out how to tune the cogs and the wheels so that when the final product comes out it’s something that everybody loves and can use effectively,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>First-year economics major Brian Lee said he would be open to any type of effort by A.S. to make information gathering in classrooms more collaborative, but said he would not use the technology himself.</p>\n<p>“I think something like this would be useful for studying because other people could clarify ideas from lecture,” Lee said. “I don’t think I would use it because I feel like I get a better understanding of material by putting it in my own words.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Any individual can register and participate, and at the first Dance Marathon event held last year, hundreds of dancers participated and raised around $13,000 for Cottage Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biological science major and co-chair of Dance Marathon Molly Morrison said there are over 250 college campuses that put on dance marathons, making Dance Marathon the largest collegiate philanthropy effort in the nation.</p>\n<p>“I helped found dance marathon, but our first event wasn’t until last March 1,” Morrison said in an email. “This year, we have 600 students registered to go to the event, and our goal is $25,000.”</p>\n<p>According to Morrison, the event raises money for the Children’s Miracle Network hospitals, specifically the Cottage Children’s Hospital in downtown Santa Barbara, which, according to Morrison, is an essential part of healthcare on the central coast.</p>\n<p>“Cottage Children’s Hospital is the only hospital with a level 2 neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric intensive care unit in central California, making this hospital a vital one for many families in the state,” Morrison said in an email.</p>\n<p>At the Dance Marathon event, food will be provided and participants will be split into teams, each representing a different patient from the Cottage Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>“The food is catered, entertainment is provided, including student DJs, a cappella groups, and dance groups from the UCSB campus,” Morrison said. “In addition, dancers are split into color teams, with a child ambassador from Cottage Children’s Hospital on their team. It’s a great way for UCSB students to make a tangible difference in their community during their time here, and to see exactly where the money they raised is going.”</p>\n<p>According to Morrison, Dance Marathon aims to expand even more in the coming years.</p>\n<p>“We are very excited to see our growth from last year to this year, and to see how dance marathon can grow on this campus, and perhaps one day be the philanthropy by what UCSB is known for!” Morrison said.</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Claire Meyer said she just joined Dance Marathon this year and that the group has been preparing for the event for the past few months.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working for months with fundraising,” Meyer said, “I can’t wait to meet the kids and families that we are fundraising for. My brother did a dance marathon at Ohio State and he said it was one of the most awesome experiences of his college career.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61441\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61441\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/students-to-dance-for-charity-saturday/","id":2855,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2854,2853,2852],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
