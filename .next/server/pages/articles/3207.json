Similarly, having Derrick Rose on your team won’t guarantee you a win either.</p>\n<p>It’s been over a year since Rose tore up his knee in last year’s postseason. Yet, the Bulls have managed the entire season without him and are in just as good of a position right now compared to if he were in the lineup. Cleared by doctors to play two months ago, the lingering question remains: Why hasn’t he stepped on the court yet?</p>\n<p>In sports, we’re constantly reminded of the heroism that comes with playing injured. Images of a hobbling Willis Reed walking onto the court with a torn thigh muscle in game seven or Michael Jordan scoring 38 points while playing with a 103 degree fever in the NBA Finals will forever remain etched in basketball lore. However, Rose and the Bulls have taken a completely different approach to handling their situation, and that is to sit and wait until Rose is completely ready.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Skeptics argue that Rose is being selfish and putting himself before the team. With teammates like Joakim Noah battling with plantar fasciitis and still willing the Bulls to the semis, Rose’s toughness and dedication has been questioned.</p>\n<p>But what Rose is doing is the right choice not just for himself but also for the Bulls organization. For a player that is only 24 years old, there is no need for him to risk coming back from a career threatening-injury for a slim chance of defeating the Heat in a seven-game series. Let’s face it, the Bulls caught Miami by surprise in game one, but don’t count on that happening again.</p>\n<p>With the year Adrian Peterson had still fresh in our minds, it’s difficult to remember the numerous instances where other athletes never recovered from this injury, such as Olympian Michael Redd, who had his career cut short because of the ACL tear he suffered.</p>\n<p>The underlying issue here is not whether Rose is physically ready to play but whether he is mentally prepared to take the court. A player cannot be effective if he doesn’t trust his own knee to make sharp cuts and is repeatedly fearful of re-injury. The real topic of concern here with Rose is when he will finally be ready to get past that final mental hurdle; obviously, he still isn’t there yet.</p>\n<p>Let’s not forget what the other Bulls players have done in the playoffs either. While the basketball world was shocked that the Bulls went into Miami with one day of rest after defeating the Nets in seven games, the Bulls, on the other hand, were not surprised at all. They expected to win.</p>\n<p>Noah and Jimmy Butler combined for 34 points with 25 rebounds in game one, and Nate Robinson filled the role of the go-to guy for Chicago, scoring 27 points on 50 percent shooting. Chicago stuck to its game plan, and that is to play physically against an undersized Heat front court. They finished with a 46-32 advantage on the boards and outscored Miami 40-32 in the paint. If the Bulls continue to do this throughout the series, James and company will have to wait for ring number two until next year.</p>\n<p>Miami has much more to worry about than wondering if Rose will come back and play in the series because in all likelihood, Rose probably will not see any action in this round of the playoffs or for the rest of the postseason. However, when he does come back, all eyes will be on him and his knee.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Biology is something that students see in high school, they already have an exposure to it,” Stopple said.</p>\n<p>Stopple acknowledged the tendency for biology majors to declare the major with a pre-med track in mind, only to realize how overwhelming the major can be later on.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes [they switch out] because their grades were not good enough to get into medical school. They think ‘well if I’m not going to be a doctor then, I don’t want to do biology after all,’” Stopple said.</p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> reached out to students to gain insight on their perspectives regarding the department of biological sciences at UCSB, and found several recurring complaints.</p>\n<p>While it is to be expected that S.T.E.M. majors be rigorous and require strong academic engagement, many students expressed frustration with the difficulty of prerequisite classes, as well as an initial lack of emphasis on biology during the foundational coursework.</p>\n<p>“A lot of Bio students come in unsuspecting of how difficult the gen chem series is, especially resenting it because they’re not interested in studying chem in the first place, or necessarily good at it,” second-year pre-biology major Aja Whitehead said in an email.</p>\n<p>Many students found that the administrators and advisors were at best overburdened and at worst outright unhelpful.</p>\n<p>“The school would probably like to think that the major is hard and that’s why people are dropping it, but in all honesty I think the lack of support from the department itself plays a larger role,” Aidan, a fourth-year biology major who declined to give their last name, said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had great professors, but the advisors and administrators have never been helpful to me.”</p>\n<p>Olivia, a fourth-year aquatic biology major who asked that her last name not be used, expressed similar discontent with advisors who she felt encouraged her to take an excessive course load during her first quarter after transferring to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I really do feel that students look to the advisors for guidance and help with structuring their plans here and they do not provide that,” Olivia said.</p>\n<p>Ivan, a fourth-year biology major who asked that his last name not be used, was among a group of about 20 undergraduate molecular, cellular and developmental biology (MCDB) students who were part of an external review committee. The committee invites other faculty from universities around the west coast to evaluate the department, gather input from students and make recommendations.</p>\n<p>“The complaints against the Bio department were pretty strong… comments ranged from poor class structures during the first two years all the way to a deficit advisory team,” Ivan said.</p>\n<p>However, members of the faculty have coordinated with students in attempts to raise retention rates. Mike Wilton and Eduardo Gonzalez, two lecturers in the MCDB department, have worked to make more resources available to incoming freshmen who declare as pre-biology majors.</p>\n<p>Associated Students On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal has also been collaborating with Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) — alongside Wilton and Gonzalez — in an attempt to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>“[Wilton and Gonzalez] introduced the mentoring series MCDB 11, 12 and 13, which are to be taken in conjunction with the gen chem series,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>MCDB 11, 12 and 13 serve as chemistry support classes, so one can establish a community of like-minded peers with who to study and hold each other accountable. For classes like the general chemistry series which lack a section, Nagpal believes that these provide a more collaborative and intimate setting.</p>\n<p>“Having these support programs that [Wilton and Gonzalez] create is essential to student success,” Nagpal said. “They see that students who take MCDB 11, 12 and 13… these students specifically have higher retention rates in the pre-biology major.”</p>\n<p>EOP students are a demographic which leave the biology major at a much higher rate than the general student body, Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>“Low-income students have to work for college compared to their more-privileged peers… because of this they can’t devote as much attention to their academics,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>Nagpal is advocating for the expansion of financial support to more EOP-eligible students, which he hopes will alleviate some of this financial stress.</p>\n<p>“EOP has an emergency grant alongside A.S., and as a senator I have taken it upon myself to work with the director of EOP, Aaron Jones, to revise the A.S. EOP grant and essentially expand this,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>Although a consensus from students is relatively easy to find just by surveying the academic body, extensive qualitative information regarding the “why” of switching majors has not been compiled.</p>\n<p>“I’d love to have more data in many ways, and know more about the process by which students change majors. We could do better generally, as a campus, in collecting data,” Stopple said.</p>\n<p><i>Updated [9:46 p.m.]</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-82096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SB 461 will provide up to nine units of financial aid per session to students eligible for Cal Grant. <em>Will Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>In its current iteration, Senate Bill 461 (SB 461) will provide up to nine units of aid per session to students eligible for Cal Grant, and would be valid for four-year students for two summer sessions, and valid to transfer students for one summer session.</p>\n<p>Generally, summer sessions are six weeks long, shorter than the standard 10 week quarter.</p>\n<p>“There are a couple changes this year, but it doesn’t have to do with the bill, it has to do with the climate,” Kuvimbinashe “Eddy” Chikukwa, chair for Coalition for a Better UC, said.</p>\n<p>He cited the election of California Governor Gavin Newsom as a reason for why the bill may pass this time.</p>\n<p>“[Newsom is] more favorable towards funding higher education… and really willing to reform the Cal Grant system in a way that we did not see last year.”</p>\n<p>Newsom, who previously sat on the UC Board of Regents, has been much more receptive to suggestions compared to former governor Jerry Brown, who had “a very antagonistic position with regards to the UC,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>“[Newsom] got to hear a lot of the complaints people had, and he got to hear a lot of the solutions people had regarding this issue… Gavin understands that you need to fund higher education so that students have adequate aid to get out faster.”</p>\n<p>Alongside the bill, students are pushing for a budget request to ensure that money is allocated specifically for summer aid.</p>\n<p>“Last year, a lot of people were hesitant to support it because if the bill were passed it would be drawn from the general fund, and there were concerns that this money could be taken from other students,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>SB 461 has drawn more support and grown a larger coalition of interest groups that are invested in reforming Cal Grant. The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) is co-sponsoring the bill, while the CSU Chancellor’s Office and the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) are also in support of it.</p>\n<p>“There is also the will to reform Cal Grant. There is an actual desire which is evidenced by the recent assembly,” Chikukwa said, in reference to the joint legislative hearing chaired by California State Assembly Members José Medina and Kevin McCarty on Feb. 6, where “Closing the Degree Gap” was discussed.</p>\n<p>Regarding the necessity of summer aid for eligible students, Chikukwa noted the projected deficit of college graduates by 2030.</p>\n<p>“We’re acknowledging the fact that there’s a 1.1 million college graduate deficit that’s going to happen, we’re acknowledging the fact that low-income students tend to be the ones who don’t graduate on time, and we’re acknowledging the fact that we need more of these students to graduate faster.”</p>\n<p>Chikukwa also noted how S.T.E.M. students, who don’t necessarily always pass their major classes, often must resort to taking summer classes.</p>\n<p>Another issue which arises is that major classes during the year are often overenrolled.</p>\n<p>“So the state is making us enroll all these students into these courses and we don’t have space to put you in right now, so the best option is summer, and the state is making the UC do this and not providing summer aid, which is problematic,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>The bill has a long way to go, however.</p>\n<p>“We just introduced it, this is still the ‘hip hip hurrah’ phase.”</p>\n<p>In order to become law, SB 461 must make it through the Senate Education Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate floor. Then, after this, it must go through the California State Assembly.</p>\n<p>However, Chikukwa is optimistic.</p>\n<p>“It was really scrutinized heavily last year. A lot of people looked at it and they made their suggestions, and so this year I haven’t heard too many objections because the final objection last year was the lack of a budget request. People didn’t have any problems with the language of the bill.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
