Taylor as the primary option in the backcourt to go along with rising sophomore Duke DaRe, who received a large amount of playing time at the end of last season.</p>\n<p>Headlining the three new recruits is Zalmico Harmon, a 6’0” point guard coming from Ventura College, where he led the Pirates to the postseason and received First Team All-State honors.</p>\n<p>“His maturity, physically and mentally, is definitely something we need on our team,” Stock said. “That gives him a great chance to make an impact.”</p>\n<p>Along with Harmon, UCSB’s recruiting class includes another point guard in Eric Childress from Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, CA. Childress was named First Team All-CIF as well as Bay League Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Eric is a true point guard where he’s a pass-first point guard,” Stock said. “He has great poise and maturity for his age. He’s definitely a guy that will be a huge asset.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruiting class for the Gauchos is 6’10” forward Alex Hart from Kelowna, British Columbia in Canada. Hart averaged over 35 points per game in his senior season for Immaculata Catholic Regional High School and was a member of British Columbia’s U-17 team.</p>\n<p>“The unique thing about Alex is the fact that he can stretch the floor with his shooting ability,” Stock said. “He can stretch the defense and give Al the chance to pound it inside.”</p>\n<p>These three recruits will join a talented roster that includes First Team All-Big West selection in rising junior center Alan Williams, along with the Big West Best Sixth Player of the Year in rising senior guard Kyle Boswell. Rising sophomores in guards John Green and Michael Bryson, as well as forward Taran Brown, are also expected to contribute heavily for another youthful UCSB squad next season.</p>\n<p>“I think all three of [the recruits] have a chance to have an impact,” Stock said. “They all bring such different things to the table and definitely address different needs we have on our team.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Gauchos won their second straight in Santa Barbara, edging out the Aztecs 5-2. With this win, UCSB improves to 2-2 overall and SDSU is currently 3-2 with the loss.</p>\n<p>“Playing at home is truly phenomenal. There’s really just nothing like it,” sophomore Morgan Mays explained. “The fans were great and I really have to give them thanks for their support. They really helped pull us through today.”</p>\n<p>Mays was truly surrounded by support from the get-go when he and his teammate, junior Andrew Riminton, found themselves in the tiebreaker match for the doubles point. They battled to a 6-4 win to grab their first doubles point of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The sophomore stud found himself playing right in front of his cheering crowd of gold when it was time to break off into singles as well.

For the second time of the day, Mays bested Bertsch, in two straight sets of 6-4.</p>\n<p>“I executed my game plan really perfectly,” Mays said. “I wanted to dictate with my forehand and hit the shots he gave me, and I was very consistent.”</p>\n<p>Another exciting win for the Gauchos came from the No. 5 court where junior Nathan Eshmade looked for his second win of the day after contributing to UCSB’s doubles round. Eshmade took the lead early, winning the first set 6-4 before dropping the second by the same score. He finished his opponent off in the tiebreaker with ease allowing him just two games in the set, and clinched the Gaucho’s victory for the day.</p>\n<p>Freshman Cody Rakela was another Gaucho to add a point on the board for his team. The rookie continued to show his potential, winning his match on the No. 3 court in straight sets of 6-3, 6-3.</p>\n<p>The final match of the day took place on the No. 6 court where sophomore Teague Hamilton played to further stretch the lead of the Gaucho’s overall victory. He silenced his opponent in the first set, winning 6-0, and then edged him out once more in the second 7-6 to give the Gauchos a 5-2 victory.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be on the road next weekend playing at No. 37 University of San Diego Saturday and UC Irvine on Sunday. Matches are set to start at 1:30 p.m. and noon, respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/mens-tennis-take-down-sdsu/","id":627,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[626,625,624],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Season Ended in Big West Tournament\nSemifinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There will be no miracle run and no Big West Championship for the UCSB women’s basketball team this year.

A 62-43 loss to Cal<br>\nPoly yesterday in the semifinals of the Big West Tournament not<br>\nonly dashed any hopes of becoming back-to-back conference<br>\nchampions, but also ended the Gauchos’ season. “I don’t like<br>\nlosing. I don’t care what the name is on the jersey,” Head Coach<br>\nCarlene Mitchell said. “In the program I’m associated with, you<br>\nexpect to win every time you step on the court. All I can go off of<br>\nin my second year here is that last year I was sitting up here on<br>\nthis podium with a lot better feeling than I am right now.” Santa<br>\nBarbara finished the year at 16-16 overall, going 11-7 in<br>\nconference play. The Mustangs improved to 20-10 and will play for<br>\nthe tournament championship today. The loss is the third straight<br>\nto Cal Poly this year for UCSB. This also marks the first time that<br>\nthe Gauchos have lost to the Mustangs during the postseason. “The<br>\nrecord may not indicate the growth that we had and the competitive<br>\nspirit we had throughout the year, but I’m extremely proud,”<br>\nMitchell said. “This was a group that I was excited to go to<br>\npractice with every day and step on the court and go to battle<br>\nwith.” In every matchup, UCSB was unable to find an answer for 6-5<br>\nMolly Schlemer. Although the Gauchos were able to hold the junior<br>\ncenter to six points in the first half, Schlemer went off for 20 in<br>\nthe second half. “She’s the Big West Player of the Year and we knew<br>\nthey were going to go into her,” senior center Kirsten Tilleman<br>\nsaid. “There’s only so much we can do and I think we did play very,<br>\nvery good defense against her. A player like that’s going to get<br>\nher shots.” While the final score might not reflect it, UCSB got<br>\noff to a great start. The best defensive team in the Big West held<br>\nthe Mustangs to 0-8 shooting to start the game, including 0-6 from<br>\nthree-point range. “Defense is our identity, so we came out with a<br>\nlot of energy, trying to not give them their easy points that<br>\nthey’ve gotten in the past,” senior guard Angelei Aguirre said.<br>\n“That was our mindset – take away what they like to do.” Aguirre,<br>\nwho has played extremely well against Cal Poly this season,<br>\naveraging 11 points in the two matchups, caught fire early, scoring<br>\nSanta Barbara’s first two baskets. Then, Tilleman, last year’s Big<br>\nWest Tournament MVP, got in on the action, knocking down two<br>\nstraight baskets of her own to give the Gauchos an 8-2 lead. “I<br>\njust try do what I need to do,” Aguirre said. “I try to be<br>\naggressive and take open shots. We knew we had to be the aggressors<br>\nfrom the beginning, so I think all of us had that mindset.”<br>\nHowever, Cal Poly was never out of the game and drained<br>\nback-to-back threes to take a 12-10 lead. The score remained close<br>\nthe remainder of the half and the Mustangs eventually took a 22-19<br>\nlead into halftime. After starting the game 0-8, the Mustangs shot<br>\n9-16 for 56.3 percent the rest of the half. UCSB, meanwhile, was<br>\ntaking good shots, but was unable to convert shots it would usually<br>\nmake, shooting just 30.4 percent from the field. “I thought the<br>\nkids competed extremely well in the first half and shots didn’t<br>\nfall,” Mitchell said. “We got a lot of wide open looks and<br>\nsometimes you can only play the pressure defense for so long and<br>\nthen you have to get a point here or there to be able to keep that<br>\nup.” Cal Poly went to its Big West Player of the Year to start the<br>\nsecond half and Schlemer answered the call, scoring four straight<br>\npoints and sparking a 13-2 run to put SB in a 12 point hole. The<br>\nGauchos didn’t help their cause though, turning the ball over six<br>\ntimes and going 1-7 in first seven and a half minutes of play. “You<br>\ntry to full front [Schlemer] and they’ll lob over the top,”<br>\nMitchell said. “You try to play behind her and double and they have<br>\nblue-collar players that can knock down the 15 foot jumper.” As<br>\ntime went on, Santa Barbara continued to fall part as it could do<br>\nno better than just trade baskets with Cal Poly. The deficit<br>\ncontinued to grow and became too much to overcome. Despite holding<br>\nCal Poly to 22 points in the first half, the Mustangs unleashed<br>\ntheir potent offense in the second half, scoring 40 points compared<br>\nto UCSB’s 24. Overall, Cal Poly shot 43.8 percent from the field<br>\nand outscored the Gauchos 22-12 in the paint. Defensively, Cal Poly<br>\nlimited UCSB’s leading scorer, senior forward Sweets Underwood, to<br>\njust four points, nearly eight below her average. For the Gauchos,<br>\njunior guard Nicole Nesbit paced the team offensively, scoring 11<br>\npoints, all of which came in the second half. Aguirre also<br>\ncontributed 11 points while Tilleman added 10 rebounds in the<br>\ndefeat. “I don’t think we can ever be satisfied with not getting to<br>\nthe NCAA Tournament, but it’s also not about just this one game,”<br>\nTilleman said. “It’s about the journey we took as a team and the 32<br>\ngames that we played. So, I’m not satisfied, but I feel that we<br>\nlearned a lot this season and I’m going to take a lot from playing<br>\nwith these people and playing for this program.” The game marked<br>\nthe last time playing in a Gaucho uniform for seniors Aguirre,<br>\nTilleman and Underwood. While they leave the program with a Big<br>\nWest Championship from last year, they know that the UCSB women’s<br>\nbasketball team is about winning. Next year’s objective for Santa<br>\nBarbara will be no different – continue the Gaucho tradition.<br>\n  <em>This article is an online exclusive and did<br>\nnot appear in the print edition of the Daily<br>\nNexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50593\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-16/gauchos-season-ended-in-big-west-tournament-semifinals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50593\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-16/gauchos-season-ended-in-big-west-tournament-semifinals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-16/gauchos-season-ended-in-big-west-tournament-semifinals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-16/gauchos-season-ended-in-big-west-tournament-semifinals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-16/gauchos-season-ended-in-big-west-tournament-semifinals/","id":628,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[627,626,625],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall in First Round of WNIT","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There may be no “I” in team, but there is in win and Wed. night, senior guard Courtney Clements propelled the San Diego State women’s basketball team to victory.

With the loss, the season officially comes to an end for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finished the season at 16-17 overall while San Diego St. improved to 27-6. The 27 victories mark the most in program history for a single season.</p>\n<p>“They’re good; I’m going to give them credit,” Mitchell said. “They played with a chip tonight and shot lights out. There’s nothing more you can say but they’re bigger, stronger and quicker. That’s the reality of it. I think our kids competed, but sometimes it’s just not your night and tonight was definitely not ours.”</p>\n<p>Despite the blowout, there was one huge bright spot for UCSB. Senior forward Sweets Underwood, who was held to just four points in the semifinals against Cal Poly, was looking for a better way to end her season. She entered Wednesday’s matchup with 999 points and wasted no time hitting the 1,000 point mark, nailing a jump shot less than three minutes into the game. She becomes the 24th Gaucho to enter the prestigious 1,000 point club.</p>\n<p>Underwood accounted for half of the Gauchos’ points, finishing with a career-high 23 points and nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I’m extremely proud of Sweets because I knew with the competitor she was, she was going to have a hard time staying in her skin for the next few weeks knowing the way she ended at Cal Poly,” Mitchell said. “That wasn’t the way she’s played all year long. I can smile now knowing she’s going to feel better about that.”</p>\n<p>The Aztecs set the tone from the beginning, playing with a chip on their shoulder after feeling like they deserved to make the NCAA Tournament. They never trailed in the game. On the very first possession, even with a defender right on her, Clements drained a three to give SDSU a 3-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>In fact, Clements had an answer every time the Gauchos tried to make a run. She scored 10 of her team’s first 12 points and with SDSU up 15-12, Clements knocked down a three which sparked a 12-0 run for the Aztecs.</p>\n<p>“We can’t allow one person to get lose,” Underwood said. “We couldn’t find a weapon to stop her and she hit everything tonight. That was the most difficult part. We were staying down, we would have a hand in their face and they would just it. It was her night tonight.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UCSB’s offense became stagnant as the team went on a 7:42 scoring draught.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos entered halftime down 40-20. While UCSB is known for its defense, it had no answer for San Diego St., which shot 52.6 percent in the half, including 53.8 percent from behind the arc. In addition, with 21 points at halftime, Clements outscored UCSB on her own.</p>\n<p>To open the second half, the Aztecs continued to widen the gap, going up by 24 points. However, with a huge hole to climb out of, UCSB finally made a push to get back in the game. With 15:36 to go, junior guard Destini Mason hit a jumper to spark a 7-0 run. Mason was the only other player for Santa Barbara in double figures, tallying 10 points.</p>\n<p>“We knew we had to buckle down on defense,” Mason said. “We were there in their face and they knocked down some pretty hard shots, but we knew we got here with defense. We got some stops and tried to push it in transition.”</p>\n<p>In the first nine and a half minutes of the final period, the Gauchos outshot the Aztecs 41.7 percent to 23.1 percent.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, the run did subside and it could do no better than trade baskets with San Diego St. the rest of the game. UCSB did play SDSU nearly even in the second half though, as the Aztecs only outscored the Gauchos 29-26.</p>\n<p>Similar to the semifinal against Cal Poly, UCSB was executing on the offensive end, but could not get its shots to fall. The team shot just 33.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“Coach at one point had to call a timeout and she told us to just relax and hit open shots,” Underwood said. “I think we were just a bit frazzled because they were hitting everything and we were thinking too much into our offense. We had to relax and be confident because they were open for us as well.”</p>\n<p>While the box score doesn’t reflect it, the Gauchos didn’t play poorly. The Aztecs were simply the superior team on that night.</p>\n<p>“I think we came out to really play,” Mason said. “We played pretty good defense; they were just knocking down some really good shots. As a team, this is a better way to go out than against Cal Poly. For the seniors, you didn’t want them to go out that way.
