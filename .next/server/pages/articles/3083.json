He said the survey would be analyzed by graduate students in the Communication Department to assess social and academic conditions on campus and said the survey would give more immediate results than other similar ones.</p>\n<p>“We know that one came out recently campus-wide, but we won’t see the results for another three years, which is why we want to do one where we will get the results back in two weeks,” Rojas said.</p>\n<p>Amy Katz, representative for the new student organization Gauchos for Recovery — a campus group in the Alcohol and Drug Program — requested $1,285 to participate in the Fourth Annual Texas Tech University Collegiate Recovery Conference. The event would allow the UCSB group to attain valuable new information on issues of recovery and addiction, Katz said.</p>\n<p>“We can bounce off ideas with students from other universities for our own campus’ benefit,” Katz said.</p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 3 of March 5th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50478\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/a-s-finance-board-deliberates-campus-organization-funding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50478\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/a-s-finance-board-deliberates-campus-organization-funding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/a-s-finance-board-deliberates-campus-organization-funding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/a-s-finance-board-deliberates-campus-organization-funding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-05/a-s-finance-board-deliberates-campus-organization-funding/","id":3083,"author":{"id":196,"name":"Tiffany Park"},"related":[3082,3081,3080],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":196,"name":"Tiffany Park","biography":"Not available","articles":[3077,3083],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"TBL Continues Campaign for Student Lock-In Fee","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tbl.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tbl.jpg?resize=474%2C419&ssl=1","description":"Next week’s Associated Students elections ballot will include a proposal for a $1.69 per quarter student lock-in fee in support of The Bottom Line, A.S.’s weekly campus newspaper.

If passed, the money would go toward providing new equipment, more content and covering of travel costs. The fee, which is one of two new A.S. lock-in fees being voted on this election, would go into effect next fall and be subject to reaffirmation every two years.</p>\n<p>Domenighini said the lock-in fee might also allow for more compensation for writers and editors to offset recent pay cuts.</p>\n<p>“One of our biggest setbacks is that we had to considerably reduce the amount of money that staff members are being paid,” Domenighini said. “So every staff member saw their paychecks go down very considerably. Editors had … the amount of money that they’re making reduced by over half.”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez, TBL was allocated $12,000 from A.S. for honoraria earlier this year, and covers a large portion of its printing costs through grants the staff applied for. However, Martinez said some of these grants may not be available next year, and the paper needs a more stable source of funding in order to continue to cover costs.</p>\n<p>Though the fee initiative failed to pass last year, Domenighini and Executive Content Editor Kelsey Gripenstraw said they remain confident it will pass this year, considering it fell short of the necessary 50 percent majority of 7,100 voters by only a couple hundred votes.</p>\n<p>“Our promotional campaign … wasn’t as strong as previous years,” Domenighini said. “Last year we really ramped that up, so I think the number one factor that we were facing last year was just that people didn’t really know who we were, so they were probably voting for a lock-in fee [when] they didn’t really know, exactly, what the publication was going through.”</p>\n<p>According to Gripenstraw, TBL’s weekly publication is not likely to change regardless of whether or not the initiative passes, but they may be forced to work with less if the measure fails. However, she said having more than one campus news source is important for the university and their readership.</p>\n<p>“We value having multiple media sources on campus, because think about how the United States would be if there was one source of media. It would be insane,” Gripenstraw said. “Like, you can’t just rely on one news source for the entire school, especially with a school as huge as UCSB. So we’re here just to provide another voice.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 10 of the April 18th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/","id":3080,"author":{"id":181,"name":"Daniel Slovinsky"},"related":[3079,3078,3077],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

These forms will then be sent to the Director of Accountability in the Office of the Internal Vice President.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Miya Sommers, who authored the bill, said the goal of the action is to implement a more efficient system for ensuring that senate members are performing their duties to the best of their abilities.</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja, a proxy for Off-Campus Senator Genesis Herrera, added that the bill will hopefully resolve what she perceives as a general lack of effort on the senate’s part.</p>\n<p>“I feel like a lot of people here … haven’t been doing the job with the power they were given to do this. They’re not holding office hours … they’re not going to the meetings and getting involved and taking students’ voices into account,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>Several senators brought up concerns with the ambiguity of the bill. According to Off-Campus Senator Alessandra Cianni, the provisions of the bill will not necessarily lead to the desired effect.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel like this bill does what it says it’s going to,” Cianni said. “It doesn’t feel like a transparency issue … I just feel like we already do this each quarter with [applications for] honoraria.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Kyley Scarlet said she would like to see more clarification of what particular information would be required on the evaluation form before making a decision on the bill.</p>\n<p>“I personally don’t feel comfortable passing something when I don’t know what it’s going to look like,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>Senators voted to hold a twenty-minute working meeting, in which they could offer their suggestions for the bill without adhering to the formal meeting procedures. During that time, Sommers discussed the language of the bill in order to clear up some of its more vague pronouncements. Senators passed the revised bill in an 18 to 3 vote.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed the progress of the proposed taxicab program, which would allow UCSB students to charge cab fares to their BARC accounts. External Vice President of Local Affairs Rhandy Siordia, who spearheaded the project, said the next step in the process will be choosing a company to partner with.</p>\n<p>“We’re at the point now where we can put a bid packet together and subsequently choose a taxi company,” Siordia said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also approved a motion to push back the start of their weekly meetings from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in order to better accommodate Senators’ class schedules.</p>\n<p>After adjourning last night’s meeting, Senators went into a closed meeting for an hour. The meeting’s purpose was to discuss personal matters and reduce some of the negativity and contention that has been building among senators over the last few weeks.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 21st 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Benjamin Pu/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50271\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50271\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/","id":3081,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3080,3079,3078],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Hold Symposium About  Violence, Effects on Underrepresented Students","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SCORE-picture.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SCORE-picture.jpg?resize=400%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Associated Students’ Student Commission on Racial Equality (SCORE) hosted a conference called “Against the Gun: Deconstructing Narratives of Violence in Communities of Color” on Saturday in the ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students’ Student Commission on Racial Equality (SCORE) hosted a conference called “Against the Gun: Deconstructing Narratives of Violence in Communities of Color” on Saturday in the SRB.</p>\n<p>The eight-hour event, which was the organization’s 14th annual Facing Race Conference, consisted of workshops and lectures aimed at examining the concept of violence and how it affects various communities of color, discussing micro-aggressions, sexual violence and different forms of resistance used. SCORE focuses on any issues regarding students of color on campus and helps fund over 100 UCSB multicultural organizations, according to SCORE Co-Chair Navkiran Kaur.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, this weekend’s conference was one of the group’s most important events of the year.</p>\n<p>“We fund the delegation of UCSB students to go to the Student of Color conference which is an annual statewide conference,” Kaur said. “The other huge thing we do is this Facing Race conference, which is our own UCSB-wide annual conference.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, violence was chosen as this year’s topic due to the prominence of issues like gun control and terrorism in national discourse.</p>\n<p>“We felt violence was a very prevalent topic in today’s time, what with the professional violence that occurs in India, the different issues with gun control going on, terrorism, like so many different ideas of violence, it’s not just that mainstream idea of a gun,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>One of two guest speakers, Outreach Coordinator and Santa Barbara Unified School District consultant Ismael Huerta spoke on the importance of family ties and secure communities for future generations as a way of avoiding the spread of violence.</p>\n<p>Along with the set of lectures, SCORE held 16 different workshops available within three distinctive time ranges throughout the day. A workshop on the growing trend of terrorism as a method of violence hosted by A.S. Outreach Coordinator for Human Rights Board Will Ellis entitled “Who’s the Real Terrorist?” detailed the classification of certain groups as terrorists and the various outcomes that have resulted from creating stereotypes.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Lizeth Lomeli attended Ellis’s workshop and various other lectures during the event after learning about Facing Race through Womyn’s Commission. According to Lomeli, learning about terrorism from the point of view of those who have been wrongfully discriminated against opened up her perspective.</p>\n<p>“It was super interesting because I’ve never gotten that point of view from, I guess, people who have been called terrorists or have faced issues in post-9/11 aftermath society,” Lomeli said.</p>\n<p>Another workshop, “Migrant Realities” explained immigration policies from the past and their effects on the immigrant population of today.</p>\n<p>“I have parents who are immigrants and it was really interesting to hear those points of views from students who are undocumented now and just the bravery and courage that it takes for them to continue being in school and in an environment where they are risking everything to somehow better themselves,” Lomeli said.</p>\n<p>Attendees were also able to utilize caucus spaces, which served as meeting rooms for students who were interested in specific topics such as Mixed Heritage and Womyn of Color. Along with the guest speakers, workshops and meetings, Facing Race included entertainment at the end of the day’s events featuring Mexican folklorito dancers, SCS Zhangra Punjabi folk dancing and Iaorana te Otea traditional and modern Polynesian dances.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science and French double major Jonathan Fackler, a member of the Sigma Chi Omega fraternity, participated in his fraternity’s singing performance at this year’s Facing Race.</p>\n<p>“We were doing the performance and we thought ‘hey let’s check out the event and support our fellow fraternity members’, and it turns out, you know, this event was really well-coordinated,” Fackler said. “There were a lot of people, a big supportive crowd, food, snacks, the performances were amazing and it was really entertaining.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6> This article appeared on page 6 of February 25th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50329\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50329\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/","id":3082,"author":{"id":198,"name":"Carly Bates"},"related":[3081,3080,3079],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
