And in some cases, a fresh start is exactly what some teams need now that conference play has come to the forefront of the action. With championship bragging rights and a NCAA invitation bid on the line, these nine Big West foes will be battling all season in order to prove they are the better team, at least for this year. Whether UC Riverside will repeat as champs, or another squad will dethrone them, one thing is for sure, these conference match-ups will be some of the most intense basketball these teams have faced all season. With that being said the Daily Nexus Sports Staff presents a preview of each Big West squad, enjoy! <strong><em>Note: With the exception of UCSB, who was ranked No. 4, the rest of the teams are ordered from first to last according to the Big West coaches preseason polls.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Barbara – Sean White </strong></p>\n<p>Now two games into its Big West Conference schedule, currently 6-9 overall and 1-1 in conference play, the UCSB women’s basketball team is hoping to build upon last year’s postseason return.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos returned to the Big West Conference Tournament for the first time since 2013 after a 12-20, 8-8 conference finish last season. Winners in four of its last six games, UCSB managed to gain some momentum after going on a three-game winning streak but was unable to sustain its momentum heading into conference play with a 64-60 loss in its final nonconference game to Yale.</p>\n<p>Projected to finish seventh in the Big West Preseason Media Poll, the Gauchos are better geared for the conference schedule after an improved nonconference finish in year two with Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson. Santa Barbara improved by one win after a 4-12 nonconference finish during its 2015-16 campaign.</p>\n<p>Set to begin a three-game home stand versus UC Riverside this Saturday, UCSB’s home stay at the Thunderdome is a pivotal opportunity for the Gauchos to move up in the conference rankings.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the Gauchos allow an average of 60.2 points per game when playing at home. UCSB has crafted one of the toughest defenses in the Big West as it ranks second in points allowed per game (64.0) and third in opponent three-point percentage (28.8).</p>\n<p>Although UCSB hasn’t found much consistency offensively, ranking third last in scoring with a PPG average of 60.1, the emergence of sophomore guard Coco Miller has been significant in the team’s performance.</p>\n<p>Miller leads the Gauchos in scoring at 11.3 PPG. She has already tied her previous season-high mark of two 20-plus point games after recording a career-high 24 points versus Pepperdine and 23 points on the road at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The addition of redshirt junior forward Drew Edelman has provided the Gauchos with a post presence, a feature that had been missing on both ends of the court.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s 53.4 field goal percentage ranks third in the Big West. She has tallied three double-doubles thus far and recorded a career-high 20 points in the Gauchos’ victory over NAU earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UC Riverside this Saturday, Jan. 14 at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State – Ryan Burns </strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Long Beach women’s basketball team has enjoyed an impressive start to their season at 10-6 overall, 1-0 Big West, including a pair of wins over LMU and Nevada, proving themselves as an early contender for the Big West Crown. The Niners have also been tested against the nation’s very top teams including Duke and Florida, gaining valuable experience on the biggest stage.</p>\n<p>The team is led by senior forward Madison Montgomery who leads the team with 11.4 ppg on .456 shooting percentage, also a team high. The forward has shown marked improvement since last season when she finished the year with 8.6 points a game on .376 shooting. Behind Montgomery stand senior guard Raven Benton (10.2 ppg) and senior guard/forward Jewelyn Sawyer, the team’s leading rebounder with 6.9 boards per game.</p>\n<p>The trio of seniors link up to form a strong core of a team with high ambitions, hoping to leave with titles to show for their 49ers careers following last year’s 24-9 finish (12-4 BWC). Coming off a loss to Hawaii in the conference tournament and Oregon in the WNIT, leaving them with a bit of revenge to seek as Big West play tips off.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis – Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>No doubt, one of the biggest threats in the Big West women’s conference this season is the UC Davis squad, which was expected to finish in second place behind LBSU in the Big West standings at season’s end.</p>\n<p>The Aggies have put together a solid year thus far, boasting an 11-4 overall record and a 2-0 start in conference play after blowout wins against UC Irvine and Hawaii. They are also currently winners of five of their last six games.</p>\n<p>Although UC Davis only has five upperclassmen on the roster, the team is not short on talent. One example of this is redshirt sophomore Morgan Bertsch, who is following up an excellent rookie campaign with an even better second year as she is leading the Big West in points per game with 17.5. She also leads her squad in rebounding with 5.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>This year, the Aggies have been great on the offensive end as a team outscoring their opponents by over 100 points at 1097-969. They currently lead the Big West in points per game with 73.1 and currently hold the best assists per game as well at 17.1.</p>\n<p>UC Davis will face off against Long Beach State in what could be the game that decides the Big West winner on Thursday, Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside – Andrew Hernandez</strong></p>\n<p>Coming off of a disappointing early playoff exit in the 2016 Big West Conference tournament, the UC Riverside Highlanders look to repeat as Big West Conference regular season champions despite losing two-time Big West Player of the Year Brittany Crain.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders won their home Big West opener and are currently 1-0 in conference play, looking to leave behind a 7-7 record in nonconference play. The Highlanders’ win increased their regular season game winning streak — which dates back to last season — to 17.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have been depending on seniors Réjane Vérin and Simone DeCoud, who were on the 2016 Big West Conference First and Second Teams, respectively, to lead their offense.</p>\n<p>“Vérin and DeCoud are the engines that drives our team’s success,” Head Coach John Margaritis said. “We need them to produce with consistency for us to be successful and to allow our role players to fill in and contribute.”</p>\n<p>Vèrin, the team’s starting forward, scored 21 points, hauled in 10 rebounds and had seven assists in the Highlanders’ last game. The talented senior is currently leading the team in the blocks, points, assists and rebounds per game categories. Senior guard DeCoud is right behind Vérin as she is second in those same categories.</p>\n<p>UCR continues its road to Big West dominance when it faces Cal Poly in its second conference game of the season tonight at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii – Elliot Thornton</strong></p>\n<p>Capturing its seventh NCAA Tournament bid and first Big West Championship title since 1996 last season, the University of Hawaii has big shoes to fill following the departure of its five seniors and a 21-11 finish.</p>\n<p>Projected to land in the middle of the pack, selected to finish in fifth place in the preseason coaches’ poll, Head Coach Laura Beeman is mindful of the time it takes young teams like hers to develop and replicate a winning culture.</p>\n<p>“We’ve put last year behind us,” Beeman said. “We’re a totally different team now with new players looking to establish their own identity. We want to formulate our own traditions and use that as a springboard for this season and the next.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine sit at 4-10 on the year and 0-2 in conference play following a 68-57 loss to league favorite Long Beach State last Thursday.</p>\n<p>With a team that featured three All-Big West selections last year including Big West All-Tournament MVP Ashleigh Karaitiana, the pressure is on for upperclassmen junior guard Sarah Toeaina and senior point guard Briana Harris. Toeaina has emerged as an offensive catalyst for the Rainbow Wahine averaging 11.8 ppg. Hawaii will face Fullerton this Thursday at 7 p.m. HT.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge – Liam Bailey</strong></p>\n<p>Since winning back-to-back Big West tournament titles in 2014 and 2015, Cal State Northridge’s reign at the top of the conference has gradually diminished. The loss of talent after winning its pair of conference titles is what influenced CSUN’s downward spiral last season.</p>\n<p>After a fairly dreadful 2015-16 season in which the Matadors finished 7-24 and 5-11 in conference play, this season has certainly been an improvement for a young team featuring only one senior.</p>\n<p>Sitting at 8-8, 1-1 in the Big West, the Matadors are up showing many naysayers by being at the .500 mark. Despite not being consistent enough to achieve a winning streak beyond two games, Northridge has still played strong following its losses. Only twice this season has the team lost consecutive games.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the Mustangs’ Big West slate saw them handle Cal State Fullerton 58-41, before falling to Cal Poly 79-68. Sophomore center Channon Fluker has paced her team in points, scoring 15.3 per game on 49.3 percent shooting in just over 24 minutes per contest. She also averages a double-double, raking in a conference leading 11.1 rebounds a game, which also ranks as the most on her team by a sizable margin.</p>\n<p>Fluker’s post game is accompanied by redshirt junior guard Serafina Maulupe’s perimeter shooting ability, as her 39 three-pointers made leads for the team and contributed to her average of 11.5 points per contest.Maulupe is the team’s second-highest scorer and only other Matador scoring in double figures besides Fluker.</p>\n<p>Maulupe is the team’s second-highest scorer and only other Matador scoring in double figures besides Fluker.</p>\n<p>Despite several impressive performances on the year, including losing to Michigan State (12-4) by only four points, two-time Big West Coach of the Year Jason Flowers, and the Matadors seem to have a viable chance to return to their winning ways in 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly – Richard Benites</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly women’s basketball may not have begun their 2016-2017 season the way they wanted to, but they are now currently tied with UC Davis for first place in the Big West Conference standings.</p>\n<p>After Saturday’s 79-68 win over the visiting CSUN Matadors, Cal Poly is off to an impressive 2-0 start in Conference play. This turnaround mentality is exactly what the Mustangs were looking for as they exited the preseason at a meager 4-8.</p>\n<p>“Our pre-season had quite a few challenges. I would have hoped that we would have learned at a quicker pace considering that we had so many returners,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “The good news is that we have been learning and improving.”</p>\n<p>The improvements are evident as three different players have found themselves in the top 5 of the Big West’s Individual Offense Leaders category.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Dynn Leaupepe places fifth overall points per game for the Big West (14.9), just as her sister, junior guard Lynn Leaupepe, is second overall in Rebounds per Game (8.1). Coach Mimnaugh is impressed with the initiative these twins convey and how their talent complements the skills of fellow teammates.</p>\n<p>The third offensive leader is senior forward Hannah Gilbert, who is also praised for her defensive ability. Coach Mimnaugh also believes that Gilbert’s performance so far should warrant her consideration for Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Mustangs current showing promotes the notion that the team is headed in the right direction whilst being led by a splendid coaching staff.</p>\n<p>“We have an unselfish, hard-working group who have bought into the roles they play … a great sign for continuing to strengthen chemistry and teamwork,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>This week, Cal Poly will look to extend their undefeated streak on Thursday, Jan. 12, on the road against UC Riverside at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine – Spencer Ault</strong></p>\n<p>It was only three years ago that the UC Irvine women’s basketball team picked to finish eighth in the Big West preseason poll, surprised everyone by going 9-7 in conference play and managing to pick up a postseason victory in an overtime game against UC Davis in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Picked again to finish eighth this year, that recent history suggests it would be foolish to assume that the Anteaters will meekly fall into their predicted position.</p>\n<p>Early returns indicate that if UC Irvine does indeed defy this year’s preseason predictions, it might be in the opposite direction of what they did in 2013-14. The Anteaters entered conference play sporting a conference-worst 2-12 record and two ugly losses to UC Davis by a score of 89-48 and UC Riverside 76-58 haven’t helped matters.</p>\n<p>If Irvine stands a chance of turning things around and emulating that 2013-14 season, it will be on the strength of senior Shereen Sutherland, junior Sabrina Engelstad and sophomore Andee Ritter who are all averaging double digits in points per game.</p>\n<p>Sutherland, a 6’2” forward, is averaging a team-high 6.9 rebounds per game, while Engelstad leads the squad in blocks. Rounding out the trio, Ritter has come up with a team-leading 2.3 steals per game.</p>\n<p>These three players will be the key to a massive turnaround for first-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue’s team. The Anteaters have not helped themselves much so far this year, but UC Irvine of all teams should know that it’s still possible to defy expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton – Quinn Moslander</strong></p>\n<p>After a tough 2015-16 season, the Cal State Fullerton women’s basketball team has entered conference play with a two-game losing streak but looks to improve as the season progresses. So far, they sit at a 3-12 record, similar to their overall record of 3-27 last year.</p>\n<p>Despite recent losses, the team has increased their average points scored per game from 55.8 to 60.7 and improved their field goal percentage from 35.5 to 37.9 since last year.</p>\n<p>The Titans’ top scorers — senior guard Iman Lathan, junior center Daeja Smith, and senior guard Jordan Jackson — lead their team despite having not played last season. Grabbing a combined score of 38 points in their most recent conference game against the Gauchos, they also have the most playing time alongside sophomore guard Jade Vega and senior guard China Henderson.</p>\n<p>With only three wins under their belt this season, the Cal State Fullerton Titans have room to improve their record and play on the court. Their next game will be at the University of Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 12.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74737\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74737\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/2016-17-big-west-womens-basketball-conference-preview/","id":293,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[292,291,290],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Non-Conf.

Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi comes in at 4-5 as it is on a current two game slump. Able to recently overcome a nine game losing streak is North Dakota State as it sits at 2-9.</p>\n<p>Providing the most consistency has been the Gauchos’ backcourt duo of senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and redshirt junior guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>Although not widely known for their scoring abilities, with Jemerigbe and Toler averaging 8.4 and 6.9 points per game, respectively, the two have efficiently distributed the ball to create scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe’s total of 39 assists is tied for first in the Big West, while Toler’s 35 dimes ranks fourth in the conference. Both also rank in the top 10 of the conference in assists per game with Jemerigbe in second with an average of 3.9 and Toler in fifth at a 3.5 average.</p>\n<p>Most recently, it was Toler that emerged to get UCSB over its losing woes with the game-winning jumpshot in the team’s victory over Fresno State on Friday. She has been a pivotal asset in the Gauchos’ bench rotation as her PPG average leads all second unit players.</p>\n<p>Coming off its season-high three-point percentage of 50 percent in its win, it is likely UCSB will attempt to maintain its hot hand from long distance. On average, the Gauchos make 7.1 three-pointers per game and are just two three-pointers short of being tied with UC Davis for second place in total three-pointers made this season with a current mark of 71.</p>\n<p>Leading Santa Barbara’s three-point attack is redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter. She possesses a team-high total of 25 made three-pointers and is third in the conference in three-point percentage at 43.1 percent.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB has successfully defended the perimeter as well. The Gauchos lead the Big West in opponent three-point percentage, holding teams to a 25.9 average.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos may meet their match Monday afternoon facing Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi as the Islanders’ defense is one of the best of their conference.</p>\n<p>Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi ranks third in the Southland Conference in scoring defense, allowing 61.1 PPG. Most notably, the Islanders hold a conference-leading 29.6 opponent three-point percentage. They rank second in opponent field goal percentage too, restricting past teams to a 37.9 average.</p>\n<p>A pair of wins could send Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi into Southland Conference play with a winning record for just the third time in program history.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos will face more of a defensive battle in playing the Islanders, they will hope to contain North Dakota State’s junior guard Taylor Thunstedt.</p>\n<p>Thunstedt leads the Bison in scoring with 16 PPG which ranks third in the Summit League. She also leads the league in total made three-pointers with 42 and is fourth in points scored with 176 this season.</p>\n<p>Another concern for UCSB will be dealing with the size of senior forward Emily Spier. She’s behind Thunstedt in scoring with an average of 10. 3 points per game, but is the team’s leading rebounder, collecting eight per game, ranking third in the Summit League.</p>\n<p>Adding to the Bison’s presence on the boards is senior forward Brianna Jones. She is second on the team in rebounds at 7.4 per game.

In the top spot, Cal Poly finished the regular season 4-1. Since Pacific handed the Mustangs their only conference loss and the Anteaters beat UCSB 4-3 on Feb. 14, the Tigers earned the second seed and Irvine placed third.</p>\n<p>However, the rankings at the end of the season have not proven to be a significant threat to the Gauchos’ reign over the Big West. Although the top two seeds earn a bye in the first round of the tournament and play only two days of tennis instead of three, last season the Gauchos finished third in the conference and still beat Irvine 4-3 in the conference championship.</p>\n<p>Still, the Gauchos have had some trouble against the better conference teams during the regular season. They lost 6-1 to Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo and 4-3 to Irvine in Orange County.</p>\n<p>Freshman Benjamin Recknagel has arguably played the best tennis for the Gauchos this season. The Germany native has won all five of his matches in the second singles slot and earned Big West Player of the Week honors twice, and owns the best overall singles record on the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>With 2008 Big West Player of the Year, junior Philip Therp, back and healthy in the first singles slot of the starting lineup, the Gauchos are gaining momentum at the right time. The team has won six of their last seven matches.

With a current 2-0 Big West record, the Highlanders have now won 18 consecutive conference games.</p>\n<p>Allowing a combined 175 points in its two losses to the Highlanders last season, UCSB is committed to improving on the defensive end in attempt to contain the orderly ball movement and quickness of UCR’s potent offense.</p>\n<p>With the nearly uncontainable Brittany Crain, former two-time Big West Player of the Year and star player who put up a combined 56 points in two wins over UCSB last year  no longer in a Highlanders’ uniform, the Gauchos have one less worry to conquer in facing UCR’s arsenal of scorers.</p>\n<p>Following last season’s finish as one of the conference’s top defenses, UCSB has remained consistent defending the ball. The Gauchos are the third best scoring defense in the Big West, allowing just 64.0 point per game.</p>\n<p>Saturday has the potential to be a defensive battle as the Highlanders sit atop the conference in points allowed per contest, allowing 63.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Since the start of Big West play, UC Riverside has matched its stoutness on defense with improvements on offense as well. In two conference games, UCR is tied in scoring with an average of 72.0 points per game.</p>\n<p>A team that boasts three double figure scorers, at the forefront of the Highlanders’ offense is the versatile talent of senior forward Réjane Vérin.</p>\n<p>UCR’s power in the paint, Vérin leads the Big West in both scoring and assists per game at averages of 17.1 and 4.5, respectively. She is also known for her hustle on the boards as her 8.1 rebounds per game places her second in the league.</p>\n<p>Vérin has flat out been the best player in Big West play thus far, averaging a conference leading 23.0 points and 10.5 rebounds per game, respectively. Leading UCR’s frontcourt, she has tallied four double-doubles in addition to scoring 20-plus points in six games this season.</p>\n<p>Aiding Vérin is the backcourt duo of senior guard Simone DeCoud and junior guard Lauren Holt. With higher expectations placed upon them entering this season, both have emerged to help carry the offensive load for UC Riverside, averaging 12.5 and 12.4 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>Most notably, both have been impressive on the defensive end of the court as well after playing in two conference games. Since the beginning of Big West play, DeCoud and Holt each average 2.0 steals per game, tying for fourth most in the conference.</p>\n<p>In preparing to face a team that can be productive on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball, UCSB must remain committed to its pace of offense and not allow UCR’s fast paced strategy to dismantle its possessions as the Highlanders possess a conference leading 6.1 steals per game.</p>\n<p>Known for operating its offense around its shooters, UCSB plays at its highest level when it can knock down the three.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ last four games they have made at least six three-pointers.</p>\n<p>Typically known for her driving ability, senior point guard Onome Jemerigbe has been efficient from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>She currently leads the Big West in three-point percentage with a 45.9 average and is coming off a 3-for-3 performance from beyond the arc in UCSB victory over Cal State Fullerton last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Also within the Gauchos’ split of games during their pair of conference openers was the outstanding three-point shooting of sophomore guard Coco Miller.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB in scoring with 11.3 points per game, Miller made a career-high seven shots from behind the perimeter to end the game with 23 points in UCSB’s loss to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Helping spark the Gauchos’ three-point shooting has been the assisting of both Jemerigbe and redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler. Since the start of Big West play, Jemerigbe is tied for the conference lead with Vérin at 5.5 assists per game. Off by just .5 of a mark is Toler at 5.0 helpers per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Riverside will tip-off this Saturday, Jan. 14  at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-14/gauchos-to-host-uc-riverside-in-conference-home-opener/","id":292,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[291,290,289],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
