Yang email UCSC administrators and UC President Janet Napolitano to “denounce threats” of firing against graduate students at UCSC and call for system-wide cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) negotiations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA movements have popped up at every UC campus except for UC San Francisco, but the amount students are asking for varies from campus to campus depending on local housing costs. UCSB 4 COLA is calling for a monthly amount </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,807.51</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which would be given to all graduate students regardless of individual salary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although housing costs have been an issue in Santa Cruz for years, UCSC brought the discussion of a COLA to the forefront starting in September 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After delivering COLA demands to administrators in November, UCSC graduate students began a partial strike in early December by withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades, which at least 85 graduate students still have not submitted, according to a UCSC Graduate Student Association (GSA) email sent to UCSC graduate students on Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest points of tension between administrators and strikers is the withheld grades, for which graduate students at UCSC have been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-18/janet-napolitano-ucsc-administration-warn-of-termination-to-striking-ucsc-graduate-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sent termination warning letters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. UCSC Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer gave UCSC strikers a deadline of Friday at midnight to turn in grades and end their strike, but the graduate students voted at a meeting late Friday night to continue striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer sent an email Monday morning to UCSC faculty “to clarify that fall-grade submission … will be verified on Thursday, Feb. 27,” a change from the previous Feb. 21 deadline set by Kletzer to submit grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC GSA wrote in an email to graduate students that they </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consider [themselves] terminated from [their] employment” and that as of Monday morning, 351 graduate workers have committed to withholding Winter Quarter 2020 grades and several departments have committed to refusing Spring Quarter 2020 appointments if striking graduate students have their spring appointments revoked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Friday occupation of Cheadle Hall was organized in solidarity with the “doomsday strike” at UCSC, the name being coined due to the termination warnings and midnight deadline from administrators. Across the UC system, graduate students on almost </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/skamidi/status/1230910763281211392\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every campus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> held a demonstration, rally or other action in support of the UCSC strikers on Friday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC strike </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— and the imminent UCSB strike — is a wildcat strike, meaning that graduate students are acting separate from United Auto Workers Union 2865 (UAW 2865), the union that represents graduate students UC-wide. The current UAW 2865 contract extends until 2022, and a clause in the </span><a href=\"https://uaw2865.org/know-your-rights/contract/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contract states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “there shall be no strikes, stoppages or interruptions of work” while the contract is still active.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW 2865 </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQnj7hw2866SMHQiNM_NH1TWZQPm-cfG4CzlyohAl6s/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formally asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the UC to meet them at the bargaining table to negotiate a COLA for its members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cost of living concerns have consistently been a high priority for academic student employees, and we have bargained over these matters in every set of contract negotiations at the systemwide table since 2000,” UAW 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar wrote to Peter Chester, executive director of labor relations within UCOP. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe both the Union and the University have an interest in ameliorating the economic hardships faced by its academic student employees who face some of the most high-rent cities in the city and country, and welcome sitting down to negotiate over these matters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students have been organizing for a COLA since December, but most of the movement’s initial actions were in solidarity with the striking UCSC graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actions at UCSB began with a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-12-14/in-photos-ucsb-rallies-in-solidarity-with-ucsc-graduate-students/\">solidarity rally</a> in December and with a </span><a style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/ucsb-grad-students-hold-demonstration-in-solidarity-with-uc-santa-cruz-over-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">“sick-out”</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January, when approximately 150 graduate students, faculty and undergraduates marched from Storke Tower to the Arbor to coincide with the UC Regents meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers officially </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delivered</span></a> <a href=\"https://ucsb4cola.org/demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a COLA on Feb. 10 to Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall at Cheadle Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to calling for a COLA of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,807.51</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> per month, organizers demanded that the COLA payments do not come from “an increase in undergraduate or graduate tuition, campus fees, or university-owned housing rent.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers also emphasized that the university “must not retaliate in any form, implicit or explicit, against graduate students, undergraduate students, faculty, staff, or any other individuals who support and/or participate in the struggle for a COLA, regardless of citizenship or visa status.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands also say that the COLA must be adjusted from year-to-year depending on inflation, and that the university should further accommodate graduate students with dependents who might have additional financial needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We fight for a COLA not just for ourselves, but as part of a larger struggle for a dignified life for all at the university,” UCSB 4 COLA wrote in its demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A COLA is more than just a raise: it is a structural commitment by the institution, recognizing that this university would not function without graduate student labor.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers within the UCSB 4 COLA movement have emphasized the importance of undergraduate and faculty solidarity and have been circulating petitions calling on both of them to support the movement.

Some noted that they had not originally planned to speak but became convinced to after seeing others do the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many speakers urged for allyship from non-Black communities and emphasized the need for people in a position of privilege to self-educate about the Black community’s struggles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black people are everywhere and deserve to feel safe everywhere,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers expressed discontent with the Black student experience at UCSB, noting a lack of resources and a small population of Black students, </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currently at 5%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the undergraduate student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walk in I.V. and see what it feels like to have everybody staring at you for no damn reason,” one speaker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers shared personal accounts of police violence and fears that their Black loved ones could wrongly face violence or death at the hands of law enforcement. One speaker recounted a conversation with her younger sister in which her sister said she was afraid to go for a walk, or for her father to leave the house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I tried to tell her that she is safe, but I know in the back of my mind that that was not true. Even if she does everything right, even if she gives them no cause to bother her, there is a chance that she might become the victim of police brutality in this country just because of who she is,” the speaker said. </span></p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-94721-2-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94743\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94744\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94768\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94747\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94742\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94741\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94746\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94745\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94748\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94766\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethan Bertrand, a member of the I.V.

Some people may not think that you belong here, which you do, but some people don’t understand that, so please be careful,’” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so hard for us to find the strength to battle through our tears to say that once again, we’re going to stand together and stand up,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers also stressed the need for Black voices to be heard and acknowledged by non-Black communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pay attention to Black voices. Stop trying to speak over us. Stop trying to tell us what the answer is,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several UCSB administrators were in attendance at the demonstration, including Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life; Aaron Jones, director of the Educational Opportunity Program; and Diana Collins Puente, director of community affairs, student development and leadership at UCSB’s Associated Students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s absence and lack of communication prior to the start of the march was widely criticized by participants. About halfway through the speeches, Yang sent out a mass email to the student body that addressed Floyd’s death and expressed sympathy for those affected by his death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His words mean very little to me at this point,” one speaker said after reading aloud Yang’s statement to the crowd.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 1:30 p.m., protestors marched through I.V. chanting and holding homemade signs, as employees at local businesses observed from behind windows or stood outdoors to cheer on protestors. Once it reached Del Playa Drive, the crowd drew Isla Vistans out onto their balconies and into their yards. Some observers held their own signs and clapped for protestors, while others silently stared as the crowd marched toward Sands Beach, gathering more marchers along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surfers on bikes and families with children stood off to the side while protestors made their way down the dirt trail to Sands Beach, eventually gathering in a circle in a small field, where the demonstration’s organizers thanked the crowd for its solidarity and called for 30 seconds of silence to remember Floyd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those 30 seconds, protesters held their fists high in the air, some closing their eyes, the sound of the breaking waves the only noise.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

There’s definitely some unfair practices happening around the fact that the UC Regents refuse to discuss it; it’s pretty disappointing,” said Kate Ripley, a first-year psychological and brain sciences major who was there to attend her Feminist Studies 30 section.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In college, I’ve noticed in all of my classes that I don’t get nearly as much instruction from professors as I do from the TAs. The TAs are there to talk to you personally. The TAs are always there for you,” said Jamie Donofrio, a second-year computer science major. “They need to live, and that’s kind of a thing where if a person needs to live, we need to be there to support them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Ripley’s perspective, the themes of Feminist Studies 30, which including unfair labor practices and exploitation, are relatable to COLA movements across the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just find it very disappointing that in this situation, the graduate students have been kind of villainized and made to seem that they’re asking for too much or asking for more than others, when they’re just asking for enough to survive,” Ripley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially with the police force that was used at Santa Cruz, it is just really disappointing. As someone who is paying tuition, I know my tuition is going towards police brutality, and that is really frustrating.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both at the noon rally and throughout the day at Cheadle Hall, COLA organizers emphasized the importance of undergraduate support, encouraging them to attend COLA meetings and bring their friends.

I think UC bureaucracy is trying to keep this limited to a single campus because then they think they can quell the movement,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that, from her perspective, the representatives of UCGPC are “anti-COLA” and don’t represent the feelings of UC graduate students as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I guess my question at the end of the day would be why would she talk to COLA if she doesn’t want to legitimize the movement,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC’s GSA sent an email to Napolitano, the UCSC administration and UCSC graduate students in response to Napolitano’s statement, noting that “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCGPC has nothing to do with the COLA campaign [and] has refused contact since its inception.” They added that there is no UCSC representation on that council. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kavitha Iyengar, the president of UAW Local 2865, issued a statement earlier this morning echoing Sorin’s concerns about Napolitano’s invitation to UCGPC, saying the council did not “have legal authority to bargain on the workers’ behalf.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Conflating COLA negotiations with UCGPC’s other advocacy efforts is an attempt to buy time and deflate the energy of this movement — and it will not work,” Iyengar wrote, adding that UAW Local 2865 had </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQnj7hw2866SMHQiNM_NH1TWZQPm-cfG4CzlyohAl6s/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formally asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the UC to bargain with the union for a COLA in Janaury. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB 4 COLA plans to hold a General Assembly meeting on Monday at 6 p.m. in the MultiCultural Center, where they intend to discuss their actions moving forward and prepare for the Tuesday meeting with administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think in part some of that is going to be determined by what is happening at Santa Cruz come Monday morning,” Sorin said. “If folks are receiving termination letters, that may escalate things here faster, it may not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a collective movement and we are really doing our best to ensure that we are not making decisions without as many voices as possible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Sorin said she was “floored” by the response on Friday, particularly from undergraduates and faculty, and hopes to continue building a UCSB coalition moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been here for five years.
