He uses the words “fag” and “faggot” several times in the one minute and 34 second video, as well as the phrase “go fuck yourself.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand, who is openly gay, initially said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> that he was “especially disturbed” when Gelb followed him down the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Gelb <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/isla-vista-landlord-leaving-del-playa-drive-after-23-years-lists-properties-for-80-mil/\">made the decision</a> to sell all his properties in I.V. in October 2017.

CSD. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A designated sober party monitor is alerted through telephone if SBSO receives a noise complaint about the party. The monitor then has 20 minutes to shut down the party and lower noise levels, according to a <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/sheriffs-office-announces-iv-party-registration-program/\">press release</a> sent out by SBSO on Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is intended to foster a partnership between residents and police, allowing party hosts to remedy noise complaints without the need for a police response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy Justin Schroeder, community resource deputy for Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), announced the launch of the program at the April 23 meeting of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If a complaint is received, we then call or text that person and they have 20 minutes to mitigate that noise problem themselves without a police response. So our slogan for that is, ‘Get a text, not a ticket,’” said Schroeder at the I.V. CSD meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So we’re hoping people utilize that program, just to kind of foster a more community-oriented policing method out here in Isla Vista, and we hope it’s a popular program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Party Registration Program has been in Schroeder’s plans since his <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/foot-patrol-welcomes-new-i-v-community-resource-deputy/\">instatement</a> as Community Resource Deputy back in November 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think the students realize there’s like families and young kids that live in Isla Vista. We have some families that call every single night about a noise complaint,” Schroeder said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program builds on Schroeder’s goals of constructing a community-policing model and bridging the gap between law enforcement and community members. The program allows I.V. residents to monitor themselves, without the need for police intervention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar programs are also in effect in cities around the country. San Luis Obispo’s adoption of this program has been successful at California Polytechnic State University, according to the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents must follow a <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IV-party-registration-guidlines2.pdf\">set of guidelines</a> in order to register a party with the program. Parties must be registered at least 48 hours in advance and can only be registered for Fridays and Saturdays, as well as Sunday if the following Monday is a holiday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police will be dispatched if contact cannot be made with the party monitor, and a citation will be issued if noise violations are verified. A citation will also be issued if a second complaint is received by SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Properties will also lose registration privileges for nine months if complaints are received for two separate parties within nine months of each other. Individuals who have received a noise violation citation or a social host ordinance violation cannot register for the program for nine months after the last violation occurred. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, people who have received a public nuisance party citation cannot register with the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Juan Camarena of the IVFP also believes that the program will create a clearer line of communication between I.V. residents and law enforcement, along with establishing a safe environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This program embraces the idea of community-oriented policing and partners community members with law enforcement to solve the problem of noise complaints in Isla Vista,” Camarena said in the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It also creates an open line of communication between the community and law enforcement, shows transparency and cooperation, and encourages future partnerships to solve other crimes.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

arrested a 45-year-old Santa Barbara resident in Isla Vista last Tuesday for second degree attempt to commit burglary, vandalism and possession of burglary tools.</p>\n<p>The suspect, Jesus Lawrence Malagon, was found “trying to pry open the door to a storage locker” located in a carport on the 6600 block of Abrego Road, said Kelly Hoover, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Malagon used a knife –– gripped between a pair of pliers –– along with a screwdriver jammed into the door in his attempt to open the carport door.</p>\n<p>Police also reported finding other burglary tools in the vicinity, some of which included “a drill, hammer, fork, knife, and shim,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Malagon reportedly told police he wanted to pick up some of the items that he stored there and that he himself didn’t live in the area.</p>\n<p>SBSO contacted the property manager and some of the property’s tenants, all of who said that Malagon had no legal right to open the storage unit.</p>\n<p>Malagon was booked in Santa Barbara County Jail on a $20,000 bail.

<p>Police arrested a 20-year-old for cocaine possession, among other charges, in Isla Vista Saturday morning, during which a deputy “pulled out his service weapon,” according to police.</p>\n<p>The individual, Kole Yamashiro, was removed from his vehicle around 7:15 a.m. after deputies from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) observed said vehicle blocking a driveway on the 6600 block of Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>After approaching, deputies removed Yamashiro from the car and called medical officials for an unresponsive female companion who appeared to be suffering from an opioid overdose, according to Kelly Hoover, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Both were determined to be under the influence of a controlled substance, while Yamashiro was found in possession of cocaine and Xanax.</p>\n<p>A deputy then pulled his service weapon when Yamashiro “did not comply with the deputy’s commands regarding reaching into his pocket,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Manuel, a 22-year-old I.V. resident who asked that his last name not be used, initially posted on Facebook after he witnessed the incident.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the Nexus, he said the police had been called because the vehicle was blocking the entrance to his driveway.</p>\n<p>Manuel said he saw no sign of resistance during Yamashiro’s arrest and that the officer had taken “aggressive action.”</p>\n<p>According to Manuel, a police officer “pull[ed] out his gun” and “threatened to shoot [Yamashiro] while he was on the ground.”</p>\n<p>“The male was not armed, was clearly confused to what was happening because he was woken up by the cops,” Manuel said.</p>\n<p>The female, who Manuel said had woken up after police arrested Yamashiro, was shouting that it was Yamashiro’s fault they were locked out of their apartment and subsequently had to sleep in their car, according to Manuel.</p>\n<p>Yamashiro, who is on probation, was officially charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale, being under the influence of a controlled substance and possession of a narcotic.</p>\n<p>He was cited and released approximately 11 hours after the incident.</p>\n<p>It is unknown if Yamashiro is an Isla Vista or Goleta resident because the address provided on Yamashiro’s arrest log does not exist.</p>\n<p>Yamashiro initially enrolled at Santa Barbara City College in Fall 2016, but later withdrew later that quarter. He re-enrolled in Spring 2017, but again dropped his classes.</p>\n<p>Hoover said SBSO does not release body camera footage of an incident for an incident that is currently under investigation, in accordance with Government Code 6254(f).</p>\n<p><i>Updated [Aug. 24]: This article was updated to include Hoover’s statement regarding body camera footage. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
