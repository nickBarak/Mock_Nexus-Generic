Title IX is intended to end sex discrimination in all areas of education and has been applied to cases regarding sexual harassment and sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Melgoza’s sexual assault allegedly took place last year on Jan. 18, after which she filed for an investigation on Oct. 2014 after speaking to both Counseling and Psychology Services (C.A.P.S.)  and Campus Advocacy Resource and Education (C.A.R.E.)  in the Women’s Center about the assault.</p>\n<p><strong>Where Melgoza Says It Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>Melgoza said the reason she did not file for investigation until seven months after first approaching Judicial Affairs was because of their reaction to her case. She said she was discouraged by the Judicial Affairs officials who claimed that her case might just be about the perpetrator’s lack of performance during sex.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I didn’t file the investigation on March 13 was because I was discouraged to file it because they told me that maybe it was just … bad sex … what the official had said was … ‘If he was drunk maybe he didn’t perform as well,’” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza also said Judicial Affairs discouraged her by pointing out that she did not have the evidence to win a case and that the process to file it would be lengthy.</p>\n<p>“They were saying, ‘Well it’s going to be a long process, where [there’s] not enough evidence, you’re not going to be able to win,’ and at that point I was very upset and angry… and at that point I was just like, ‘You know what, fine, I guess I won’t file it,’” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>After filing the investigation, Melgoza allegedly repeatedly asked Judicial Affairs to not allow her perpetrator to enter her workspace before they gave into her requests in November.</p>\n<p>“Finally, at the end of November, they ended up getting him out of my job,” Melgoza said. “If I didn’t demand it then they probably wouldn’t have listened to me. They would have just given up.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Case Conclusions and Enforcement</strong></p>\n<p>Melgoza said it was decided by Judicial Affairs in January that she had enough evidence to file a charge against her perpetrator under Section 102.08 of the Student Code of Conduct, which allows campus regulations to apply to certain off-campus behaviors, including sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“In January … I got a phone call from Judicial Affairs and they ended up telling me that, yes, there was enough evidence to file a charge of sexual assault which in the student code is code 102.08,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>An email sent from Sexual Violence Conduct Committee (SVCC) Co-Chairperson Miles Ashlock to Acting Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Mary Jacob revealed the Committee met on Feb. 6 to hear the charges against Melgoza’s assailant and voted 3-0 that there was “sufficient evidence” that her alleged perpetrator was “responsible for sexually assaulting” Melgoza.</p>\n<p>On March 2, Melgoza received the decision from Jacob that the alleged assailant would be suspended for the Spring and Summer quarters of 2015, meaning he would not take classes or be allowed on university property.</p>\n<p>“I waited 15 days for the Vice Chancellor to make her decision … and in the first week of March I received a letter and an email saying that my perpetrator was suspended for spring of 2015 and summer of 2015,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>The March email from Jacob stated the three-member Sexual Violence and Conduct Committee “recommended a two quarter suspension,” without explanation for how the punishment was determined to be appropriate for the crime. Jacob approved the verdict of the SVCC, finalizing the decision by writing, “I find that I concur with the Committee’s recommendation and therefore suspend you for two quarters,” the email read.</p>\n<p>According to Melgoza, the alleged perpetrator was seen on campus by a friend in the first week of ring Quarter although she had the sanction in writing, indicating the Judicial Affairs was not enforcing the sanction on which they had decided.</p>\n<p>“Third day of my spring quarter, week one, one of my best friends … told me that she had seen him on campus,” Melgoza said. “In writing it clearly says that he cannot be anywhere affiliated with UCSB … the administration needs to know how to enforce their sanctions.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said although she would like to discuss a change of policies with Judicial Affairs, she is uncomfortable and will not be dealing with them regarding her own case any longer. Melgoza said she will be filing the Title IX complaint because many students go through the same process with Judicial Affairs and do not see justice.</p>\n<p>“I am done with Judicial Affairs. I would like to negotiate with them about policies and changes that need to be made but regarding my case I am not comfortable talking to them anymore,” Melgoza said. “I’m going to file Title IX because this is just an injustice and it happens to so many students.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she felt disrespected by the university for their mishandling of her sexual assault case.</p>\n<p>“I just felt completely not listened to and not respected by the institution as a whole because at the end of the day, I’ve been through every outlet possible … and I still haven’t had a result,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Soojin Ro said the sanction given to the perpetrator was not harsh enough and could not ensure that he does not sexually assault another person.</p>\n<p>“I think that the consequence for him is too weak since suspension isn’t enough to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” Ro said.</p>\n<p>Ro also said however there are different degrees of sexual assault, and depending on the details of the crime there should be harsher or weaker punishments.</p>\n<p>“If there is a first, second and third degree in murder, then sexual assault also has different degrees that relates to different punishments, so it depends on the details of the case,” Ro said.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes Can Occur</strong></p>\n<p>Melgoza said the only way change can occur in the system is through student pressure on the university to take action. She also added that this is difficult because it is a task that requires a lot of persistence.</p>\n<p>“If enough students file enough complaints and if they put more pressure onto the university then the university has to make changes,” Melgoza said, “because unfortunately the university does not feel the pressure because it is such a hard topic that it is draining.”</p>\n<p>According to Melgoza, it is vital that mental health professionals and more C.A.R.E. advocates on campus are made available on campus for students in need.</p>\n<p>“Mental health is so important and we need to increase the amount of staff that we have in mental health because it is just very necessary- extremely necessary for students,” Melgoza said. “As well as more advocates in C.A.R.E. because only four advocates in C.A.R.E. is not enough for the amount of cases that are handled at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Director of Counseling and Psychological Services Jeanne Stanford has stated on the C.A.P.S. website that as a personal mission, she intends to make counseling easily accessible to any student in need of it, while also eliminating the shame some students feel when seeking counseling.</p>\n<p>“One of my main goals is to make counseling available and accessible to all students,” Stanford stated. “I also strongly believe in erasing the stigma sometimes associated with seeking help so that students … know that counseling is indeed meant for all of us.”</p>\n<p>According to Stanford, there are multiple campus groups that mean to help sexual assault survivors and assist student recovery from unhealthy romantic relationships.</p>\n<p>“We have two healing after-sexual assault groups,” Stanford said. “And we also have a group called Empowering Us: Finding Wellness in Romantic Relationships, which has been a group where people can explore unhealthy romantic relationships that they’ve been in.”</p>\n<p>Director of News and Media Relations for the Office of Public Affairs and Communications George Foulsham said in a press release that the university offers support services 24-hours a day, seven days a week through C.AR.E. He stated that C.A.R.E. can help students report misconduct through multiple options, including filing a complaint via Title IX, the police and Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p>“The university provides individuals with confidential advocacy services through C.A.R.E., our Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct. These support services are available 24/7,” Foulsham stated in an email. “C.A.R.E. advocates can help students understand and access reporting options through Title IX, police and the Office of Judicial Affairs.”</p>\n<p>Foulsham also said he hopes to continue discussion on concerns that have been raised to the attention of the university.</p>\n<p>“We take concerns raised by our students extremely seriously and as such we look forward to having an opportunity to meet with our students involved in today’s action to continue to discuss their concerns in detail,” Foulsham said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Stanford, C.A.P.S. is an ally to the survivor community on campus. She wants students to know that C.A.P.S. provides services to help student heal after instances of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. is obviously an ally to the survivor community whether they’re male, female, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender,” Stanford said. “We do believe in helping students … We have healing after sexual assault groups here and that’s a kind of service that C.A.P.S. provides.”</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on the page 4 of Thursday, April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

and lack of adequate punishment of perpetrators. <em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students gathered for a sit-in outside the Student Resource Building on Monday in protest of the university’s alleged mistreatment of sexual assault survivors and lenient punishment of perpetrators.</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, a second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major, organized the event in response to the alleged mishandling of her case by the Office of Judicial Affairs when she reported she had been sexually assaulted. Melgoza claims she was repeatedly silenced and mistreated by Judicial Affairs staff, with her assailant receiving a suspension for two academic quarters and set to return to UCSB this upcoming fall quarter to continue his studies.</p>\n<p>Amidst protesters’ loud chanting, Melgoza said she was discouraged by Judicial Affairs when she reported she was sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p>“I was raped in my dorm on January 18, 2014,” Melgoza said. “I ended up sitting down with a Judicial Affairs officer and unfortunately she discouraged me greatly. She said there was not enough evidence — that it might be a long and arduous process, implying that I would never win.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If I cheat on a test, I am going to get suspended on the spot. But if I violate someone else’s body, that is not seen as something serious and the consequences are for a lifetime. – Alejandra Melgoza</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Melgoza, universities across the country are failing to properly address reports of sexual assault and provide support to survivors.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t stay silent because it’s such a huge problem,” Melgoza said. “Universities across the nation are protesting this because people are angry that such a horrible violent crime is not being treated seriously. If I cheat on a test, I am going to get suspended on the spot. But if I violate someone else’s body, that is not seen as something serious and the consequences are for a lifetime.”</p>\n<p>The university has released a statement on the matter, refusing to comment on the individual case but affirming the services available for students experiencing sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“In order to protect the privacy of individuals, and to encourage future reporting of cases, we do not discuss details of individual cases. The University provides individuals with confidential advocacy services through CARE, our Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p>The university also affirmed its adherence to UC policy and state and federal law.</p>\n<p>“We have a thorough student conduct process that we recently strengthened by moving sexual assault investigations to our Title IX office in accordance with UC policy and government guidelines. We take concerns raised by our students extremely seriously and as such we look forward to having an opportunity to meet with our students involved in today’s action to continue to discuss their concerns in detail.”</p>\n<p>Protesters called for UCSB administration and the UC system to restructure sexual assault policies and sanctions to allow for harsher repercussions for sexual assaulters and improved support for survivors. With these changes, protesters hope to eliminate the culture of silence surrounding the issue of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Kelty Kauffman, third-year feminist studies and English double major and co-chair of Take Back the Night, a student committee working with sexual assault survivors and advocates for the prevention of sexual assault, said the current sexual assault policies limit the university’s ability to properly discipline sexual assault perpetrators.</p>\n<p>“The only things the university can do are suspensions, expulsions and bans from campus — none of which they do very well,” Kauffman said. “I’ve personally never heard of anyone getting expelled for sexual assault. The maximum consequence for people who are found guilty of sexual assault is a two quarter suspension.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62371\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62371\" data-attachment-id=\"62371\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/students-protest-alleged-mistreatment/sit-in-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428935647\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"58\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TBTN Sit In\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62371\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sit-In-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62371\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Kauffman, staffers of the university’s existing support system for survivors are not properly trained and should be more accommodating to those who have been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p>“There is just consistent mishandling — the people who work in these spaces like the Judicial Affairs Office are obviously aren’t trained on how to talk or work with survivors,” said Kauffman. “When you’re going through a process that takes over a year and you’re constantly asked things that trigger you to think about something painful, that’s a big deal.”</p>\n<p>According to Tanya Cortez, a friend of Melgoza and second-year math major, when Melgoza went to pursue the case, Judicial Affairs allegedly reported no longer having evidence of the case.</p>\n<p>“Her perpetrator left for personal reasons and when he came back, that’s when she felt very uncomfortable,” Cortez said. “She went again to pursue it … and they had like no records of their case. She had already reported [the crime] in spring, and they had no idea where this case was.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the end of the day, life doesn’t stop. – Alejandra Melgoza</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Marlene Alcantar was among the line of students holding giant signs to protest the mistreatment of survivors and said change needs to be implemented across all UC campuses regarding sexual assault policy.</p>\n<p>“I’m here to support Alejandra but also any other survivor that the system has not given justice to,” Alcantar said. “I wish the system was not so lax.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said every survivor goes through different experiences and must do what is comfortable for them to move past their experience.</p>\n<p>“Finding a way to empower yourself is the best way to make this happen; for example, I just released myself to social media,” Melgoza said. “At the end of the day, life doesn’t stop. I want to make sure that these policies are enforced so I can keep moving on with my life and reach my goals.”</p>\n<p>[Update: A previous version of this article state the university did not return requests for comment.

Party candidate for College of Letters &amp; Science Senator, gives listeners at The Hub her platform. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juan Ornelas and Nima Bencohen, from the Isla Vista Party and Campus United respectively, presented their transfer-specific goals at the forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All four candidates for Letters and Science senators from the Campus United party, Joshua Takeuchi, Allison Adam, Gabriella Shofet and Emily Quach, were present at the forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Party put forth two candidates for the position of Letters and Science senators, Xochitl Briseño and Ricardo Uribe, who both attended the forum as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates were given 30 seconds to make opening remarks, which they used to introduce themselves, their majors, the party they were running with and the position they were running for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a breakdown of each candidate’s response to the questions presented at the forum: </span></p>\n<p><b>FIRST PRIORITY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bencohen wants to focus on expanding CLAS to upper division courses which he believes will benefit not only transfer students but all students at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas is interested in addressing complaints raised by transfer students about the lack of social interaction fostered between them. He wants to expand programs at the Transfer Student Center to make transfer students feel more at home at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe said his platform is built upon reducing food insecurity on campus and making food more accessible. He wants to accomplish this by expanding the meal ticket program to make food available to all students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeuchi said his main initiative is to set up a “comprehensive website” for student-run businesses that would allow students to gain experience that would prepare them to be competitive applicants in the job market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quach wants to use her experience in the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) office and working for lobby corps to revamp GOLD after “being inspired by other UC’s and what their students are pushing for on their campuses.” Specifically, she wants to implement a class selection shopping cart to streamline the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam wants her first project as a senator to be reading the entire legal code so that she can “know it like the back of [her] hand.” She would also like to create an A.S. school supplies bank, similar to the A.S. Food Bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shofet wants to create a website to connect students and researchers on campus to make research opportunities more accessible for undergraduate students because UCSB is “one of the world’s best research institutions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briseño considers the biggest problem at UCSB to be retention. She wants to “make sure that underrepresented communities have the resources they need to attend this school” and wants to form a committee dedicated to voicing student concerns to the administration. </span></p>\n<p><b>INVOLVEMENT AT UCSB:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briseño referenced her involvement with grassroots movements since her first day at UCSB. She wants to be somebody who “amplifies student voices.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeuchi spoke about his involvement in Sigma Eta Pi, an entrepreneurship fraternity, and believes that his focus on technology will help him come up with “efficient ways to solve student issues.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe cited his work on Pride Week and in helping to put together the Drag Show this past week as an example of how he “knows diversity.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam emphasized her experience working in the EVPLA office, where she helped put on workshops. She also cited her experience working as the CSD coordinator, where she gave students direct access to the local government and their programs, such as the CSO program or UCIV.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quach spoke about how her time in the EVPSA office gave her the opportunity to advocate against tuition hikes on the statewide level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bencohen talked about his involvement with the Gift of Life finding donors for bone marrow. He also spoke about his experience with the Transfer Student Association.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas cited his work on student government at the community college he attended as well as his work as a Student Apartment Complex Coordinator.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shofet believes that dialogue of any kind is important to “bring communities together.”</span></p>\n<p><b>PROJECTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam spoke about “constantly reaching out to the administration” and giving the university a “well-thought out plan” with input from various different communities to give projects a fighting chance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe emphasized his interest in carrying out a meal ticket program and believes that the biggest barrier to its execution is funding. He hopes to allocate the funds that A.S. has power over and work with the university to have an open dialogue about what the program would look like. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bencohen, speaking specifically about transfer students, said that one of the biggest problems is the diminished orientation program. He wants to work with the transfer orientation staff at the Office of Student Life to expand the program and pass a resolution within A.S. to allocate funding toward the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quach brought up her plan to revamp G.O.L.D., stating that she would want to work with the UCSB administration and reach out to other UC campuses to collaborate with them and learn about similar projects that they’ve done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas referenced Bencohen’s initiative to make the transfer orientation program more comprehensive, stating that it was a goal of his as well. He said he would want to speak to the Transfer Student Alliance and the administration to talk about how the program can be better.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takeuchi spoke again about his plan to create a “comprehensive website,” saying that he would pitch his plan to the administration and use his connections with them to market his plan to the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briseño spoke about wanting to be the voice of the students and cited her experience in grassroot movements on campus as beneficial for that. She believes that her work in those organizations will help her work with administration to ensure that diverse communities on campus are heard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shofet expressed interest in creating a council with student-elected representatives for “students and faculty to actually sit down together in a room and have a conversation.” She also spoke about her experience working with Katya Armistead and Margaret Klawunn to implement kosher and halal accommodations for Jewish and Muslim students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting for the A.S. elections begins Monday, April 23, and closes Thursday, April 26. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Zavala and Garcia presented their platforms and informed students about the office of the Student Advocate General, an A.S Executive office designed to help students with legal disputes, navigate casework and act as a liaison between students and UCSB Office of Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p>To begin the forum, the A.S moderator asked the two candidates what defined the role of the Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>Garcia said the primary responsibility of the Student Advocate General is to protect and uphold the rights of students.</p>\n<p>“The role of the Student Advocate General is to be a public defender,” Garcia said. “It’s to make advocating for students a primary concern, and make sure you spend time and effort on the struggles that students face in their everyday lives.”</p>\n<p>Zavala said the Student Advocate General serves to provide an unbiased space for students to voice their problems.</p>\n<p>“The role is to make sure students get their right for due process, whether it be through judicial affairs or the various other resources on campus,” Zavala said. “The Office of the Student Advocate General is supposed to have a staff with a non-partisan perspective that is there to provide students with the help they need.”</p>\n<p>Zavala said her experience working under three past student advocate generals and acting as unofficial student advocate general prepared her to actively take on the role. If elected, Zavala said she would implement a Gaucho safety app, legal observers for the office and residence hall accessibility spaces.</p>\n<p>“Working in the office, I’ve seen a huge gap in accessibility for students living in the residence halls,” said Zavala. “If elected it would be a primary concern to make sure the spaces in the residence halls like Santa Catalina and San Rafael are utilized to provide students with a way to get to resources without having to travel.”</p>\n<p>While acknowledging the differences between herself and Zavala, Garcia said she would also focus on making the Office of Student Advocate General readily available to students.</p>\n<p>“Although my experience level is different, my experience is crucial for the office to be successful,” Garcia said. “Having served as a co-chair for Student Commission on Racial Equality and the co-chair for United States Student Association, I know how to represent the student body, and I want to create an office that listens to the students.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Candidates also answered questions about police presence in Isla Vista and minority representation in A.S., as well as addressing scenarios in which students would request help from the student advocate general regarding legal issues.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">President’s Candidate Forum</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_62368\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62368\" data-attachment-id=\"62368\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-forum-brings-candidates-to-the-hub/president-panel-_-hari-patel-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428934699\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"President Panel _ Hari Patel-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62368\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Hari Patel/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/President-Panel-_-Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62368\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A.S. Presidential candidates Jimmy Villarreal (left) and Jason Garshfield (right). <em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Candidates for presidency in the upcoming Associated Students election held a forum in the Hub in the University Center on Monday discussing goals and policies for their potential terms next year.</p>\n<p>Jason Garshfield is running for A.S. President with the party he founded — the Free Thinking Patriots party (FTP) — and Jimmy Villarreal is running for A.S. President with the Open People’s Party (OPP).</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Garshfield said the main focus of FTP is to represent students and their opinions.</p>\n<p>“Our party platform is fairly simple. It was designed to represent the students of this university in a way they are not currently being represented in this association,” Garshfield said.</p>\n<p>Third-year history of public policy major Villarreal said OPP has many goals in mind for the next year pertaining to UCSB campus as well as Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Some of the things we really want to work on this year is varied areas such as academic excellence, fiscal responsibility, safety in Isla Vista, rolling back tuition and mental health,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he hopes to address police presence in Isla Vista as A.S. president.</p>\n<p>“If there has been a voice for civil liberties on the current A.S. board, I haven’t heard it,” Garshfield said. “Some students are happy with policing here, some aren’t. I’m going into politics so I can provide some sort of balance.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he believes the police presence in Isla Vista is too great, and I.V. should demonstrate the ability to function well without the current high levels of police occupation.</p>\n<p>“I want to work with the community and the police presence here,” Villarreal said. “I agree with Jason — there is too many police here and that is a natural response to what happened last year. But I think we need to show each other and the police presence here that we can take care of our own community and we can govern ourselves.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal also said funding mental health services is one of his top priorities to create a safe resource and community for mental health patients.</p>\n<p>“Mental health — that’s something I am very passionate about,” Villarreal said. “I am going to be working to bring a $125,000 federal grant so we can provide mental health first aid training to every student who would like it.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said freedom of speech is one of his main concerns and he is unsatisfied with UCSB’s current ranking provided by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is given a yellow light by F.I.R.E.,” Garshfield said. “I think that is unacceptable for a university of our caliber and as A.S. President I will work to modify speech codes so that they ban forms of harassment, forms of inappropriate behavior while allowing students the whole gamut of freedom of speech.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he hopes to assist students by expanding program such as the A.S. Food Bank, increasing grants and scholarship availability and communicating student opinion on a UC-wide level.</p>\n<p>“Some things we are going to do is to expand the A.S. Food Bank from three days a week to five days a week, as well as creating more scholarships and job opportunities for students,” Villareal said. “Finally, I am going to be working on a statewide level to bring every single students concerns to Janet Napolitano, to the Regents, to the state legislature.”</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, the self-governance issue in Isla Vista could be solved simply by opening more businesses in I.V., which would create competition as well as tax revenue to effectively convert I.V. into a city.</p>\n<p>“I think AB 3 doesn’t go far enough; I’d like to see Isla Vista become a city,” Garshfield said. “The reason that I’ve been told that that’s not feasible at this time is because of tax revenue. Bringing businesses into Isla Vista — I think that will bring down prices and that will bring up quality, and will help us become a city, and finally end this self-governance issue once and for all.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Collegiate Senator Candidate Forum</strong></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_62366\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62366\" data-attachment-id=\"62366\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-forum-brings-candidates-to-the-hub/collegiate-senator-panel_vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428924056\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"220\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Collegiate Senator Panel_Vivian Bui-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62366\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62366\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Six OPP members running for collegiate senator seats. <em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Six candidates running for positions as collegiate senators representing the College of Letters and Science (L&amp;S), the College of Creative Studies (CCS) and the College of Engineering spoke at a candidate’s forum in the Hub yesterday in preparation for the upcoming Associated Students elections.</p>\n<p>Four candidates will ultimately be elected to represent L&amp;S, one for CCS and one for Engineering as prescribed by the A.S. Legal Code. All six candidates at the forum are running with the Open People’s Party (OPP).</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, a second-year history of public policy major running for L&amp;S collegiate senator, said his past experience includes reforming police relations with the Isla Vista community and helping organize events such as Pizza with Police.</p>\n<p>“I’ve worked with police, primarily with Deltopia,” Minoiefar said. “Being an intermediary between the police and residents, letting them know of different ordinances that were in place, and letting them know if they were in violation of these ordinances.”</p>\n<p>According to Minoiefar, he is in constant contact with Lt. Rob Plastino of Isla Vista Foot Patrol to come up with solutions to safety issues for large-scale celebrations such as Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“Since Halloween I’ve been meeting weekly with Plastino and these meetings have resulted in many things,” Minoiefar said. “Primarily on the day of Deltopia we had the UCF program, like I mentioned is a volunteer program, and passed out over 5,000 water bottles.”</p>\n<p>Niki Elyasi, a second-year biopsychology major running for L&amp;S senator, said she hopes to create more resources for students on campus, such as greater numbers of campus study areas and a tutor service for students in majors in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).</p>\n<p>“I hope to establish a STEM mentor program as well as create more study spaces on campus,” Elyasi said. “Students don’t have to cram into the library or be uncomfortable throughout midterms or finals week.”</p>\n<p>According to Elyasi, she plans to communicate frequently with students and represent them effectively as a collegiate senator.</p>\n<p>“I hope that next year as senator this is something that I will be able to do very very well, to minimize the gap between students and their representatives,” Elyasi said.</p>\n<p>Dustin Larrazolo, a second-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major running for CCS senator, said he wants to work to increase diversity and representation in CCS programs.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to bring issues of diversity into CCS because it’s a fairly uniform program in the university that we see,” Larrazolo said. “A lot of students from underrepresented backgrounds aren’t really addressed with specific needs that need to be tailored to them.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said, as a queer student himself, he aims to make changes to CCS to ensure inclusivity towards people with different sexualities.</p>\n<p>“I want to also bring up the queer issues, as I am a gay student in CCS,” Larrazolo said. “There are a lot of students who are gay and lesbian or unidentified in CCS and I want to have their experiences be just as great as everyone else’s.”</p>\n<p>Heather Vest, a third-year biology major running for L&amp;S senator, said she is passionate about environmental issues and specifically wants to address the current drought and examine UCSB’s efforts to conserve water.</p>\n<p>“I hope to work on environmental issues across the campus including drought awareness,” Vest said. “We’re in a severe drought so I want to understand why our campus is so green compared to everywhere else in California.”</p>\n<p>Vest said she wants to provide specific resources including grants and on campus support groups to aid financially struggling students.</p>\n<p>“I also want to work with underprivileged students, like students with increasing hardships, especially financial hardships,” Vest said.</p>\n<p>Sara Maroofi, a third-year mechanical engineering major running for engineering collegiate senator, said there are programs available only on campus that students require, which she wants to make more accessible.</p>\n<p>“I would really like to help spread the software that a lot of engineers have used across the campus,” Maroofi said. “[The labs] often get crowded during midterms and finals so I’d really like to increase accessibility to labs for students on campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Maroofi, her position as a resident assistant with UCSB Housing and Residential Services allowed her to organize programs to integrate students and address diversity.</p>\n<p>“The first thing that comes up in a lot of people’s mind is race, however diversity also includes sexual orientation identity, race, class and gender,” Maroofi said. “Oftentimes these get forgotten and as an RA here at UCSB I’ve put on programs to help remind people of these issues.”</p>\n<p>Stevan Abdalmalik, a second-year history of public policy major running for L&amp;S collegiate senator, said he plans to actively work against UC tuition hikes.</p>\n<p>“Our state government has chosen to underfund your education,” Abdalmalik said. “Next year, your education will cost $500 more than it already does this year, and your financial aid will not be able to recover it, meaning you’ll have to take out more student loans.”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik said he recently lobbied in Sacramento to increase funding and successfully got two bills endorsed by two different congressmen.</p>\n<p>“As a lobby trader, I’ve been up to Sacramento several times this year to lobby on behalf of our students to ask our state to fund us,” Abdalmalik said. “I was just in DC two weeks ago, asking our Congress to stop the raid on student aid and fund higher education.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
