Texas State improves to 8-4 overall on the season picking up its first road win of the season.</p>\n<p>The redshirt freshman Dashwood wasted no time in taking control of the game early, allowing no hits, no base runners, and notching three strikeouts over the first four innings of the game. The southpaw was clearly dominant, getting batters to groundout when he wasn’t forcing them to swing at strike three.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Dashwood still looked to be in control headed into the top of the sixth despite allowing a single hit in the fifth, but the big lefty found himself in trouble after retiring the first batter he faced.</p>\n<p>Texas State junior Jacob Almendarez shot a single up the middle to reach first base who would reach second base in a tough play on a squibber down the line that would leave two men on first and second.</p>\n<p>Senior Derek Scheible certainly capitalized on what was perhaps Texas State’s only scoring opportunity, sending a shot into left field which brought Almendarez home from second base. Dashwood would pitch a clean 7th inning, before being pulled before the 8th to end his night.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the 7th was where the Gauchos found themselves the closest to home they would get during the game.</p>\n<p>The Bobcats quickly retired the first two batters in the inning, but the team would load the bases after a trio of batters were either hit by pitch or walked. Sophomore Eric Yang approached the plate looking to pick up the necessary RBI’s for the lead, but the catcher would strikeout swinging to end the threat from UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos put together an exciting two-out bottom of the 9th, when Jason Willow and Marcos Castanon each singled off of Bobcat reliever Cam Baird. Tevin Mitchell would take off to first after striking out swinging where a bobble from the Texas State catcher and a throw from his knees that enough to beat Mitchell who was called out at first on the last play of the game.</p>\n<p>Prior to starting Friday’s game, Dashwood struggled in his previous three starts where the southpaw allowed at least 3-plus earned runs, 6-plus hits, and 1-plus home runs. Also noteworthy before today’s game, Dashwood had not pitched past the sixth inning and only had 7 strikeouts on the season.</p>\n<p>Scheible’s lone RBI of the game was the senior’s team-leading 12th RBI of the season. The senior has been just a part of the prime offensive contributors for the Bobcats so far this season. The trio of Almendarez, Ortega, and Schieble each have 11+ hits on the season and their combination in the lineup clearly made an impact in the game.</p>\n<p>The big lefty responded well to his prior challenges, marking the first time he did not feature the same imperfections present on his stat sheet as previously mentioned. Should Dashwood continue in this newfound direction of success, he looks to be a key part of the Gauchos’ pitching rotation as they continue this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play the midway game

designated as an Ocean Friendly Restaurant (OFR), a restaurant has to commit to a series of sustainable practices as set forth by the OFR program’s requirement sheet, including eliminating the use of polystyrene products and plastic bags, adhering to proper recycling practices and providing reusable foodware to patrons dining in the restaurant.</p>\n<p>Additionally, restaurants are required to serve vegan and vegetarian-friendly options and provide a discount to patrons who bring their own cups and containers.</p>\n<p>And as of earlier this month, Cajé is doing all of these things.</p>\n<p>According to manager Troy Yamasaki, the decision to make Cajé more sustainable was a long time in the making. He said he believes that businesses need to step up to provide their patrons with sustainable options, especially in a town as environmentally conscious as I.V.</p>\n<p>“There is something to be said about the people who did it when it was the right thing to do and not the optimal thing to do according to market demand,” Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>Daniela Schwartz, co-leader of the OFR program within the UCSB Surfrider branch, echoed Yamasaki’s words: “Young people are always looking to do environmentally friendly things that are good for our planet.”</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.surfrider.org/programs/ocean-friendly-restaurants\">Surfrider’s website</a>, the perks of being OFR-certified include national recognition on Surfrider social media, logos and other marketing materials, launch parties, collaborative promotions and, in some cases, tax-deductible contributions.</p>\n<p>Surfrider was founded in 1984 to protect ocean health, according to the website. The organization focuses on water quality, beach access and preservation and the protection of marine ecosystems.</p>\n<p>One of the ways it operates is through the OFR program, which, according to the website, was founded in 2010 to combat the disposal of single-use plastics by restaurants. The program “increases awareness, drives behavior change, and ultimately creates scalable impact to reduce our plastic footprint.”</p>\n<p>According to Schwartz, restaurants in I.V. are reluctant to commit to OFR status because there is an assumption that sustainable practices are expensive and exhaustive. This widely held belief is perhaps rooted in the fee associated with becoming an OFR, Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>Schwartz explained that the OFR fee is $62.50 per year, and that the cost of committing to sustainable products does not make a difference in the broader financial success of restaurants. Cajé made minimal changes in order to receive OFR status, with the most significant being the elimination of polystyrene products and plastic bags, Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>While Yamasaki agreed that attaining OFR status was not a financial burden for Cajé, he said that while the current demand for sustainable dining practices is still small, “the market will demand it eventually and we are already seeing small shifts. The awareness is there and appreciated, but as far as actively producing new sales, we are on the cusp.”</p>\n<p>Although Cajé is the first restaurant in I.V. to receive OFR status, there are other OFR certified restaurants in Goleta and downtown Santa Barbara, including Mesa Burger, Jane at the Marketplace, Old Town Coffee, the Boathouse at Hendry’s Beach and the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, Schwartz hopes that making Cajé more sustainable will produce a domino effect in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to move beyond coffee shops to get a real restaurant [to become OFR certified],” she said.</p>\n<p>Schwartz and her team have presented the benefits of being OFR certified to the managers of Silvergreens and South Coast Deli in hopes that they will soon follow suit.</p>\n<p>While Schwartz thinks that it is unrealistic for all I.V. restaurants to become OFR certified, she believes that the OFR program is gaining traction this year.</p>\n<p>“Good habits that begin with OFR get carried on throughout life. The ball is rolling. We are hoping to get in touch with more restaurants as the year goes on, and to spread the word about being more sustainable in any way we can,” Schwartz said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the Nov. 21, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/","id":4269,"author":{"id":273,"name":"Madeline Myers"},"related":[4268,4267,4266],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB vs Texas St. Results in 4-4 Tie","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2018-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Baseball_vsFresnoSt-180221-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Baseball_vsFresnoSt-180221-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Immediately following its loss in the first of Sunday’s scheduled games, the UCSB baseball team attempted to salvage the final game of the series but were unable to push the go-ahead run in the latt...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_81756\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Baseball_vsFresnoSt-180221-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"747547114\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82132\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81756\" data-attachment-id=\"81756\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-10/gauchos-drop-pitchers-duel-in-opening-game-against-texas-state/luke-andrews-pitches-to-the-batter-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Baseball_vsFresnoSt-180221-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Luke Andrews pitches to the batter.

After a walk and single allowed by Clements, the run was brought home from third on a scoring sacrifice fly tying the game at one a piece.</p>\n<p>UCSB had their biggest offensive inning in the second where five runners each reached base. Leigh quickly allowed the bases to be loaded after Sam Cohen and Jason Willow each singled and Michael McAdoo was walked. The bases-loaded pressure clearly rattled the Bobcat’s starter, as evidenced by the two more walks he would allow, and essentially gave UCSB an effortless 3-1 lead once the Bobcats made the final out.</p>\n<p>Similar to the first inning, the Gauchos’ redshirt junior allowed the first batter he faced on base and was unfortunately never able to recover for the rest of the 3rd inning. The runner was subsequently able to get around to third on a two-out single to Jaylen Hubbard where he was finally brought home on a single to left by senior Luke Sherley. The Bobcats would put up another run in the frame off of a bases clearing, double by freshman John Wuthrich to give his team the lead 4-3. The extra-base blow was too much for Clements as he was pulled with one out remaining in the inning in exchange for Luke Andrews in relief.</p>\n<p>Leigh would go on to allow two hits in the fourth inning, giving the Gauchos the run they needed to tie the game at 4-4. The game would subsequently be called in the 8th inning as a tie, due to a travel regulation for the visiting team.</p>\n<p>The appearances by Luke Andrews and Chris Troye always kept UCSB in the game, as both pitchers were able to absolutely stifle the Texas State batters who could not come up with an answer to the Gaucho bullpen. From just before the third inning until the end of the game the two relievers would pitch a combined two-hitter with seven strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone the Bobcat bullpen was equally stellar in their relief appearances as three reliever hurled their own two-hitter after the fourth inning. The bullpens four innings of work preserved the lead for their team as starter Zachary Leigh’s struggles nearly became too much for Texas State to recover from.</p>\n<p>The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos will play their next game at home against Dartmouth University Wednesday, March 14 at 3 p.m. PST.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82132\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-12/ucsb-vs-texas-st-results-in-4-4-tie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82132\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-12/ucsb-vs-texas-st-results-in-4-4-tie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-12/ucsb-vs-texas-st-results-in-4-4-tie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-12/ucsb-vs-texas-st-results-in-4-4-tie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-12/ucsb-vs-texas-st-results-in-4-4-tie/","id":4270,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[4269,4268,4267],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
