Only the top eight teams will advance to the MPSF Tournament. As of now, BYU has secured the No. 1 seed, but there still is a very tight race for the seven remaining spots.</p>\n<p>“This week is big; we are currently tied for third with a few other teams,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “With these last four matches, you could finish anywhere from second to ninth.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will enter tonight’s match against Long Beach coming off of a recent loss at BYU. Typically, entering a match off a loss halts momentum, or lowers a team’s morale, but it seems to be anything but the case for this Santa Barbara team.</p>\n<p>“The mentality this week has been good. We consider BYU the best team in the country and we took them 15-13 at their place. No one else has been able to do that this year,” junior outside hitter Weston Nielsen said. “We know how good we can be and we are just trying to translate that over into practice for Long Beach this week.”</p>\n<p>The key to success for the Gauchos this season has been their ability to serve and pass the ball well. Heading into this week’s games, UCSB will look to senior opposite Evan Licht and senior libero Chad Kingi to uphold these elements.</p>\n<p>Licht has dominated the service line this season, currently holding a team high 32 service aces. Kingi has anchored the back row for the Gauchos all year and is currently averaging 2.17 digs per set.</p>\n<p>Another asset to the Gaucho lineup this week is junior middle blocker Jake Staahl. Staahl is ranked fifth in the nation in blocks, averaging 1.30 per set and currently holds a team high hitting percentage of .408. UCSB will rely on Staahl to shut down some of Long Beach State’s key players.</p>\n<p>Long Beach will enter tonight’s matchup coming off of a 3-0 loss to UC Irvine. Earlier this season when the Gauchos hosted the Prospectors they defeated them in a four set match.</p>\n<p>The biggest threat for the Gauchos heading into tonight’s game will be nationally-ranked senior outside hitter Taylor Crabb. Crabb leads the nation with an average of 4.80 kills per set and has yet to see a match where he hasn’t reached double digits. Another challenge for UCSB will be Long Beach’s impressive 9-1 record at home this conference season.</p>\n<p>“In the past we have gone down to Long Beach not ready to play,” Nielsen said. “We need to go down there ready to play from the beginning and we will be fine.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCSB will travel to play Cal State Northridge. CSUN currently holds an overall record of 8-15 and are ranked 10th in the MPSF. Last time the Gauchos faced the Matadors, they swept them 3-0.</p>\n<p>Junior middle blocker Greg Faulker will pose to be a threat to UCSB on both offense and defense. Faulker is second on the team in kills and holds a .447 hitting percentage. In addition, he has a team high 82 blocks on the season.</p>\n<p>“The biggest things is that our guys know that is they play well they can beat anyone,” McLaughlin said. “They can compete with anyone in the league.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game, and Saturday night’s game are scheduled for 7 p.m. start times.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 3rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54571\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/down-to-crunch-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54571\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/down-to-crunch-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/down-to-crunch-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/down-to-crunch-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/down-to-crunch-time/","id":5231,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5230,5229,5228],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson","biography":"Not available","articles":[595,5066,5085,5112,5113,5114,5115,5116,5117,5118,5119,5217,5219,5230,5231,5232,5233,5234,5237,5238,5239,5240,5241,5242,5254,5258,5259,5260,5263,5264,5265,5266,5267,5269,5287,5289,5290,5291,5292,5295],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Take Two Losses in Weekend Play, Fall to 2-1 in Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The #15 UCSB women’s water polo team saw its seven-game winning streak snapped on Saturday, falling to CSU Northridge 8-7.

With 3:44 left to go in the first quarter, senior utility Kathryn Nelson scored the first of her eventual four goals of the day, bringing her team-leading total up to 52, tying the game at one apiece. CSUN responded quickly but senior utility Claire Buchanan then notched two goals, extending her scoring streak to eight games to put the Gauchos up 3-2 with about a minute left to play. However, UCSB’s defense could not hold Northridge back, and the second quarter opened with the game tied at three.</p>\n<p>“We know we’re better than them in a regulation pool, but they have a really small pool and it suits their lineup,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “In a small pool we can’t really take advantage of our counter attack, which is one of our strengths. They have a lot of slow players, but their also really good shooters.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The momentum from that goal carried over into the second quarter for the Matadors, as they held UCSB scoreless and took a two-goal lead, which they extended further in the third quarter as they outscored Santa Barbara 2-1. In the final quarter of the game, sophomore utility Bryce Winton scored three goals in seven minutes to lead a furious attempt at a comeback. But the Gauchos fell just short of their eighth consecutive win as Northridge dealt them an 8-7 defeat.</p>\n<p>In the game against Cal Baptist, once again the Gauchos fell behind early. The teams then traded two goals each, including one from Buchanan — who will enter the final weekend of the regular season on a nine-game scoring streak — and the quarter ended with the Lancers up by one.</p>\n<p>Senior utility Christie Clark opened the second quarter with her first goal of the day to tie the game at three, but the Lancers quickly regained the lead. Each team would record one more goal in the quarter and the first half came to a close with the Gauchos down 5-4.</p>\n<p>“I think they just came out and played very physical, and in a small pool like that it was hard to control it,” Clark said. “It was still early in the game so we didn’t have that losing mentality.”</p>\n<p>The Lancers began the second half by taking a two-goal lead over UCSB, which lasted until the 4:50 mark of the third quarter, when sophomore attacker Shelby Haroldson scored to make it a one goal game once again. The Lancers would briefly regain their two-goal lead, but Nelson scored her second goal of the game to start a run of four unanswered goals that lasted into the fourth quarter, giving UCSB a two-goal lead of its own. At this point all UCSB had to do was hold the Lancers off, but with just over a minute left in the game the Lancers would rally to tie it at nine.</p>\n<p>“[Cal Baptist’s comeback] was probably just luck,” Nelson said. “They probably got a lucky shot in and our shots weren’t going in, because we were still playing great defense.”</p>\n<p>Though Cal Baptist was officially credited with a 5-0 win in the match, the game never actually got a chance to end. With 29 seconds left to play, Wigo was given a red card and UCSB was forced to forfeit the game.</p>\n<p>“It’s too early to tell [how the Big West will play out],” Wigo said. “It looks like a lot of teams are beating each other. We definitely have to go down and at least get a split next weekend.”</p>\n<p>Though Santa Barbara went 0-2 on Saturday, there were several bright spots, too. In addition to Winton’s hat trick and Buchanan’s team-leading scoring streak, the Gauchos continued to play strong defense.

On offense, senior utility Claire Buchanan has scored in eight straight games (all player stats from the game against Cal Baptist were discarded when UCSB was forced to forfeit) — her longest streak of the season, and has scored 17 goals over that period. Senior guard Kathryn Nelson is on a seven-game streak — her second longest of the season — during which she has found the net 14 times.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing two really tough defensive teams this weekend,” Buchanan said. “It’s going to be really important for the other girls to step up and start scoring. We’ve been working on taking outside shots and focusing on [Irvine’s and Long Beach’s] weak goalies. These are our last games on the road, so they’re really important, especially for the seniors.”</p>\n<p>Senior utility Christie Clark is also a force on offense. Her 29 goals this season have brought her career total to 145, just seven away from third place on Santa Barbara’s all-time scoring list.</p>\n<p>“My focus is entirely on the season at this point,” Clark said. “If the record comes that’s awesome, but I’d be happier with a Big West win or an NCAA win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense is anchored by sophomore goalie Ruth Milne, whose 11.47 saves per game ranks first in the conference and whose 265 saves this season are just 10 away from tying her own single season school record.</p>\n<p>“[Ruth] gives the offense a lot of confidence,” Wigo said. “Knowing we have a wall in the gates gives us some leeway and allows us to take some risks that we normally wouldn’t take.”</p>\n<p>This will not be the first time this season that UCSB has faced either UC Irvine or Long Beach State. On Jan. 30, the Gauchos suffered a 9-5 defeat at the hands of the Anteaters and dropped a game against the 49ers 5-2 on Feb. 12.. Winning this weekend will not only get the Gauchos some long-sought revenge, but could also secure them the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>Although Long Beach is 0-2 in conference so far and does not pose much of a threat to the Gauchos in terms of seeding, a win against them and then against Irvine — who is 2-0 in conference — would at least guarantee them the No. 2 seed behind Northridge, who is 3-0 in conference after beating the Gauchos last weekend.</p>\n<p>“The higher seed we have the better schedule,” Wigo said. “If we’re top two we get a bye in the first round, and if we’re No. 3 we have to play the No. 6 seed. So ideally we want to be in the top two, but if we can’t get that we’ll take the third seed.”</p>\n<p>Both games are set to start at noon on their respective days. Once Sunday’s game against Irvine is over, the Gauchos will be idle until April 29<sup> </sup>— the first day of the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36451\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36451\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/","id":5229,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5228,5227,5226],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 5 Gauchos Split Pair of Weekend Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.18.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.Stanford-14-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.18.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Volleyball.vs_.Stanford-14-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB fell to the top team in the MPSF in BYU this weekend in five sets.

The Gauchos started out the match trailing the Cougars 1-0. Multiple attack errors kept the Gauchos from holding on to the lead for more than a few points.</p>\n<p>Despite their slow start, the Gauchos were able to adjust to BYU’s vocal fans and pull ahead in the second and third set. Senior opposite Evan Licht and junior outside hitter Weston Nielsen led the dominant offensive push with 15 kills each. After multiple serving errors in the first set, the Gauchos found their rhythm and cleaned up their performance at the service line.</p>\n<p>Junior middle blocker Jake Staahl also had an impressive performance, leading the Gaucho defense with a team high of eight blocks. Despite holding the Cougars to a .107 hitting percentage in the second set and dominating in the third, the Gauchos lost their momentum and gave up the fourth set to the Cougars.</p>\n<p>“They turned it up with their serves,” Seif said. “Once they are in their complete rhythm they are a really tough team to stop.”</p>\n<p>After falling in the fourth set the Gauchos were unable to bounce back. The Cougars took the victory in the fifth set with a final score of 15-13. Senior outside hitter Taylor Sander led BYU with a team-high 27 kills and had eight blocks on the night. Sophomore opposite Matt Underwood also had an impressive performance against the Gauchos, ending the night with 11 kills hitting .625.</p>\n<p>Taking down UCSB and UCLA in this past weekend, BYU moves forward with an overall record of 18-4 and a conference record of 18-2.</p>\n<p>“It was frustrating that we lost, but overall it put us in a good position to show where have come as a team,” said senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson. “Going to five with the number one team in the league showed us that we could compete with the best, and potentially beat the best.”</p>\n<p>Earlier in the week, UCSB took down Cal Baptist on the road in a quick three-game sweep. The Gauchos were able to get their momentum going early in this game, holding Cal Baptist to .034 hitting percentage in the first set.</p>\n<p>A large determinant of the Gauchos’ success this season has been their overall number of digs in a game.
