The maximum a single student can receive is $300. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The emergency fund consists of remaining funds the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) would have spent on spring programs had the coronavirus pandemic not occurred, according to IVTU Chair Alex Young. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of April 15, the IVTU has conditionally approved $55,800, roughly 99% of its total available funds, for 186 out of 294 applicants, Young said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Moving can include gas costs for moving home, renting moving vehicles, hiring a moving company, moving supplies, and plane or train tickets to fly home; Storage costs include renting a storage unit; and Temporary Housing includes expenses such as hotel, motel, or Airbnb costs,” Young said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the conditionally approved aid is distributed, the fund will have just $450 left, but Young said he is expecting to receive additional funding over the next two weeks from the Associated Students (A.S.) External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office. He did not specify how much the IVTU expects to receive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EVPLA Christian Ornelas said in an email that his office has “set aside about $3-4k should [IVTU] need more money,” and that “The uncertainty of this whole situation has put people in a tough spot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside the IVTU, institutions throughout I.V. and the UCSB community have worked to abate the economic blow that the coronavirus crisis has dealt to students. The UCSB Graduate Student Association created a coronavirus relief </span><a href=\"https://gsa.ucsb.edu/covid19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the A.S.

And there’s a lot of students; if we’ve got a lot of people [securing housing in the fall], this could get really, really complicated,” Unander said.</span></p><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian was previously scheduled to go to trial on Jan. 16, 2019, the court decided in October. However, in December, his lawyers filed to change the trial date to a readiness and settlement conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Jan. 16, Galoustian’s lawyers then requested to continue the case until Feb. 13, and then again to March 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge James Herman granted the extensions both times, albeit reluctantly. At each court appearance, Herman criticized how long it was taking to resolve the case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At today’s appearance, Herman told both parties that they either had to settle or set a trial date today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jennifer Karapetian and Lauren Franco, the attorneys prosecuting the case for the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office, told the judge they “don’t oppose” the July trial date, given that Galoustian’s current attorney, Leonard Levine, had only joined the case in January. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine said he needed more time to review the hours of video footage from discovery, which is why he asked for the trial to be set for late July. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both parties said they anticipate the trial to take 15 court days, which includes jury selection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernan also set an interim court appearance for May 29 to check in on the status of the trial preparation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 33 felony charges were filed on behalf of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/galoustian-will-face-charges-on-behalf-of-two-victims-during-january-trial/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two victims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported in October 2018.

over the next days and weeks, Ansorg said.</span> <em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newest confirmed coronavirus cases are residents between 22 to 59 years of age, with four cases in South County and two cases in North County, according to Batson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the total confirmed cases, 19 are recovering from home, four have fully recovered –– and have completed 14 days of monitoring by the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department –– and only one person has been hospitalized due to the virus, Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batson said she and her team are preparing to present specific information about the locations and regions where cases have been identified in coming days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county plans to hold press conferences every day this week to update the public on the coronavirus spread and efforts to contain it, Gina DePinto, communications manager for Santa Barbara County, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the number of cases grows in the county, the department’s efforts will focus on mitigation, Batson said, adding that the department will “focus [its] investigation efforts on confirmed individuals who have had exposures in congregate settings such as health care facilities, correctional facilities, shelters, skilled nursing facilities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cases will increase and resources will be much more impacted,” Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Public Health Officer Henning Ansorg urged Santa Barbarans to stay at home as much as possible and to “assume the virus is in your community, assume you are at risk for contracting it and take actions to stop the spread.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant rise in cases is expected over the next days and weeks, Ansorg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t really anticipate the exact numbers or over what period of time they will occur, but we are really feeling comfortable that we can meet the demand,” Ansorg said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Sheriff-Coroner Bill Brown said at the press conference that “the vast majority of people” in the county are adhering to the statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect on Thursday evening, but that repeat violators of the order could be cited, arrested and jailed, “particularly if a violator has been made aware of the order and continues to violate it.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If a person or group of people willingly continues to break the public health order, they could be charged with a misdemeanor crime and they could be cited, and in certain repeated or egregious cases, they could be arrested and jailed for noncompliance,” Brown said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first tactic for officers in enforcing the stay-at-home order will be an “explanation” of the order and a “warning,” as Brown noted that some of those who have not complied with the stay-at-home order were previously unaware or confused about the restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown added that the number of law enforcement calls, medical service calls and arrests reduced significantly over the weekend, but said there has been an uptick in domestic disturbances since the stay-at-home order was placed.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa
