In its final regular season game on the road, Santa Barbara defeated the Aggies for the first time in seven games to enter playoffs in stride. Then, as the underdog sixth seed, it then went on to win three straight games and win the Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>“We all know that it’s win or go home, so there’s no reason I should have to light a fire under them or have to find some crazy way to motivate them,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We were in the same situation last year and they should remember at least those emotions from what we’re going to have to do to win three games in a row.”</p>\n<p>However, the team also knows back-to-back titles won’t come easy as the reigning Big West Tournament Champions have an extra target on its back in an already competitive conference.</p>\n<p>“I told them, ‘it can’t be shazam.’ There’s no magic wand that’s going to allow it happen like it did last year.” Mitchell said. “That was a perfect script. I’d like it to be rewritten that exact same way, but it’s not going to happen. Every other team in the conference is a lot better.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins postseason play tomorrow night in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament at UC Irvine, the same location the Gauchos started their championship run last year. After earning a bye through the first round of play as a result of securing fourth place, Santa Barbara will play the highest remaining seed after tonight’s first round games.</p>\n<p>That means the Gauchos could see Long Beach state, Cal state Northridge or UC Davis, teams that they have gone 5-1 against during regular season play.</p>\n<p>“We’ve beaten them all, so it doesn’t matter who we play,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “It’s going to be an all-out battle no matter who we play, but we’ll be ready for them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished conference play at 11-7 and enter tonight’s game at 15-15 overall. Yet, UCSB knows that none of that matters now when it’s win or go home.</p>\n<p>“Like coach said, we’re 0-0 now,” Nesbit said. “Everything’s kind of starting over. I think we’re excited to have a clean slate going into the Big West Tournament.”</p>\n<p>The only thing UCSB hopes to take into the playoffs is its momentum as the Gauchos have won their last three games.</p>\n<p>“[The momentum is] something we need to carry us through the tournament, but it’s a completely different mindset,” senior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “It’s about showing up on any given day and being the best team in the end. It’s do or die.”</p>\n<p>In its last game at home for senior day, Santa Barbara won back-to-back home games for the first time this season, defeating UC Irvine 49-40. The game began with a perfect script for UCSB as its three seniors each scored a basket to start the game for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Down the stretch, offensive rebounds earned the Gauchos the victory. A second chance basket by senior forward Sweets Underwood gave UCSB a four point lead with 50 seconds to go and would be enough to secure the win.</p>\n<p>“I think that at different times in the game, different people stepped up,” Mitchell said. “We made plays. I’m proud of our kids and finding a way to pull it out late in the game.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos won’t be playing at home, that might prove beneficial for UCSB. Santa Barbara has played some of its best basketball on the road and enters the Tournament with the second-best road record in the Big West at 8-5.</p>\n<p>Not knowing which team it will face, UCSB has had no other option but to focus on itself.</p>\n<p>“We have the skills, we have the talent and we know what we have to do, but it’s just doing that from the tip to the final buzzer,” Tilleman said. “Now during tournament play, everyone’s going to show up playing their best game, so we can’t have lapses where we’re not getting things done, so it’s having that focus and having that leadership.”</p>\n<p>All season long, UCSB has won games with its defense. The team ranks first in scoring defense and field goal percentage defense, holding its opponents just 52.8 points per game and 36.0 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>Defense will be especially critical not only to slow down the other team, but it also fuels the Gauchos’ offense. Santa Barbara is at its best when it can get out in transition.</p>\n<p>“Everything runs through our defense,” Tilleman said. “Especially in these last few games, it’s obvious that we’re best offensively when we get a stop on defense and we can transition. If we let them score, we have to get into a set offense and they get to get into their defense.”</p>\n<p>Despite ranking last in scoring offense, UCSB ranks third in field goal percentage, shooting 40.2 percent from the field. Execution will be very important for the Gauchos entering postseason play, considering the fact that they will most likely see zone defenses the majority of the tournament, which they have struggled against at times.</p>\n<p>“Our offensive execution is more mental than anything, so we know that when we have to score, we will,” Nesbit said. “We just have to relax on offense, trust the patterns and just play basketball because Coach gives us all the freedom in the world. We have to know what to do with it.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos offensively is Underwood, who was named to the Big West first team Monday. Underwood ranks tenth in the Big West in scoring with 11.9 points per game, fourth in rebounding with 9.3 per game and third in field goal percentage at 48.7 percent.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB is not a team that relies on one player and has many who can step up. Nesbit, an All-Big West honorable mention this season, averages 10.6 points per game and junior guard Melissa Zornig averages 8.4 points per game. Senior guard Angelei Aguirre, junior guard Destini Mason and Tilleman have all proved they can step up when needed as well.</p>\n<p>“Every player has played critical roles in helping us win games and that’s how we want to approach the tournament,” Mitchell said. “They’ve all been there, they’ve all helped us win different games in different ways and they should all be confident and know that at any moment, they’re name could be called.”</p>\n<p>This year, UCSB is a veteran team. The team returns eight of its 11 players from last year’s roster that took the conference tournament title, so experience could give Santa Barbara the edge.</p>\n<p>“The games are back to back to back and you’re just out there having fun,” Nesbit said. “It’s an exciting time of the year – March Madness. This is what any college player is waiting for, so we’re excited.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Wednesday at the Bren Events Center is set for 30 minutes after the conclusion of the first game, which begins at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A pass from Tilleman to Underwood down low put Santa Barbara up 2-0. The Gauchos’ second basket came on a 15-foot jumper from senior guard Angelei Aguirre. Then, with a layup from Tilleman, UCSB went up 6-0 and very fittingly, all three of UCSB’s seniors had scored.</p>\n<p>“We had it scripted. I don’t know if you guys knew that, but the seniors would score the first three buckets of the game, so it was all a plan,” Mitchell joked after the game. “Once again, I’m brilliant.”</p>\n<p>A baseline jumper from Tilleman put the Gauchos up 10-5 with all 10 points coming from the seniors. However, as both teams settled into the game, turnovers began to plague both sides. 11 combined turnovers in the first 11 minutes of play resulted in a sloppy game with neither team able to establish any sort of rhythm offensively.</p>\n<p>“They play a really high and wide zone, often a 1-3-1,” Tilleman said. “We’ve always struggled with that and we do best when we’re doing transition offense and don’t have to run anything, so I think it just took us a while to respond to that. [Irvine] was our first game of conference play and our last, so I think we improved, but we still have a lot of room to get better against those types of defenses.”</p>\n<p>UCSB went down 10-12, but was down for a total of just 26 seconds as the team finally found its stride, responding with an 8-1 run. However, the Gauchos started missing easy shots, finishing the half on 1-5 shooting. As a result, Santa Barbara entered halftime up by just one point at 20-19.</p>\n<p>“We got a lot of open looks today,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes they don’t fall, but if you continue to be consistent in the other areas you can control, it gives you an opportunity to win like it did tonight.”</p>\n<p>Up two with just over two minutes remaining, UCSB continued to earn itself possessions through hustle plays, keeping control of the ball for 1:15. Tilleman rebounded the ball on the defensive end and then went to work on the offensive glass, knocking the ball off of Irvine to earn Santa Barbara control of the ball.</p>\n<p>After junior guard Nicole Nesbit was fouled at half court, she took the inbounds pass and drove to the basket. Despite missing the layup, Underwood was there for the offensive board. Missing the first putback attempt, Underwood continued to go after the ball, grabbing her own miss and converting the second chance layup to put the Gauchos up 43-39 with 50 seconds to go.</p>\n<p>“Our team plays well when our backs are against the wall,” Underwood said. “We know we will give it our all to get that win. So I’m thinking, ‘okay I missed the first layup. I’m going to get this rebound and lay it back up.’”</p>\n<p>After a missed shot by Irvine, the Anteaters were forced to play the fouling game. Nesbit went 6-6 from the free throw line down the stretch, icing the game for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Overall, Nesbit scored a game-high 17 points while Underwood and Tilleman finished with 12 and eight points, respectively. Junior guard Destini mason grabbed a team-high 11 boards for UCSB and Aguirre tallied a team-high four assists.</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, UCSB was solid once again, holding the Anteaters to 23.1 percent shooting and outrebounding them 38-33.</p>\n<p>“I want our team to take pride in knowing if the team should only have 30 points, let’s only let them score 30,” Mitchell said. “We take a lot of pride in our defense. I don’t think that’s anything new to this group, but it will help us win a lot of games, especially as we get to March Madness.”</p>\n<p>While the game has no postseason implications, Santa Barbara knows the importance of entering playoffs with momentum.</p>\n<p>“You always want to win your last one and our last one just happened to be senior day for us,” Mitchell said. “We haven’t really worried about the record up until this point because now we understand that we’re 0-0. You’re next game is your last game, so these kids will know that every night, we’re backed into a corner and that’s how we’ll have to play is game by game.”</p>\n<p>Last year’s Big West Tournament Champions have now won three straight games and back-to-back home games for the first team this season.</p>\n<p>“There’s no magic wand that’s going to allow it to happen like it did last year,” Mitchell said. “That was a perfect script. I’d like it to be rewritten that exact same way, verbatim, but it’s not going to happen. Every other team in the conference is a lot better. You have Pacific and Hawaii that we know we can beat and you have Cal Poly, who at this point last year I think was undefeated or had one loss, so it’s kind of ironic how everything’s set back up where if we take care of ourselves, then we could put ourselves in that position again.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin postseason play Wednesday, playing the highest remaining seed from Tuesday’s first round games.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50585\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-10/gauchos-earn-big-win-on-senior-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50585\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-10/gauchos-earn-big-win-on-senior-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-10/gauchos-earn-big-win-on-senior-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-10/gauchos-earn-big-win-on-senior-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-10/gauchos-earn-big-win-on-senior-day/","id":621,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[620,619,618],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Long Beach, Secures Fourth Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When it mattered most, the UCSB women’s basketball team came up with the victory.

We were very efficient in the stats that we know we have to be efficient in coming down the home stretch.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got off to a shaky start, going down 17-10 as they struggled to handle LBSU’s trapping zone defense. However, with just under six minutes left in the half, UCSB found its stride, going on a 10-2 run that allowed the team to head into halftime down just four at 26-22.</p>\n<p>The momentum continued to sway Santa Barbara’s way to start the second half. A three from junior guard Melissa Zornig capped off a 13-3 run and gave UCSB a five point lead, which would never be relinquished.</p>\n<p>“In the first half, they changed defenses a lot, so we had to get used to it and in the second, we started to take it out faster and push the ball more,” junior guard Destini Mason said. “We got more stops on defense and once we got stops, we get out and run.”</p>\n<p>With a first round bye on the line and less than nine minutes remaining in the game, Long Beach made its final push, going on a 9-2 run spurred by the 49ers leading scorer and sophomore guard Alex Sanchez which narrowed UCSB’s lead to two at 42-40.</p>\n<p>However, that’s when senior center Kirsten Tilleman scored her first basket, sparking a 17-10 run to end the game. The Gauchos got out in transition, finding easy looks down the stretch.</p>\n<p>“When we can get stops and get out in transition, it makes us a lot better team, especially when they’re changing defenses,” Mitchell said. “It’s easier when you can push it and you don’t have to worry about what defense they’re in.”</p>\n<p>Per usual for UCSB, the team’s tenacious defense was a huge key to the victory, especially in the second half. The Gauchos held the 49ers to 26.1 percent shooting in the final period and with 10 steals on the afternoon, forced 15 Long Beach turnovers.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s solid second half defense led to a 37-point half as the team shot 50 percent from the field and tallied nine assists on its 13 field goals in the second half. Overall, UCSB shot 43.4 percent and recorded just nine turnovers.</p>\n<p>“We’re a defense first team and when we play good fundamental defense that we work on every day, that will lead to our offense,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “I think once we focused and were in the right position at the right time, that’s what led to the run we made.”</p>\n<p>The offensive production came from a multitude of players as three Gauchos finished in double figures. Senior guard Angelei Aguirre tied her career-high with 13 points on 6-10 shooting while senior forward Sweets Underwood tallied her 12th double-double of the season with 12 points and 14 rebounds. Nesbit finished with 12 points, including 6-6 from the line, and a career-tying eight assists. Finally, both Mason and Zornig recorded nine points and Tilleman grabbed seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Players scored in a lot of different ways, whether it was at the free throw line with Nic and Sweets or Destini gave us the energy in transition,” Mitchell said. “It’s always critical that you have three players in double figures.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has now won two straight games and will look to continue its momentum Saturday in its final game of the regular season. Against UC Irvine, the Gauchos will also have a chance to win back-to-back games at home for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>While nothing will be on the line standings-wise, UCSB knows the importance of taking momentum into the Big West Tournament next week. Not to mention, the team would like to send seniors Aguirre, Tilleman and Underwood, who will all be honored before the game, out with a win in their final game in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been a little bit of a roller coaster this year and if you go to the point we were at last year, we were losing by 30 points today at Pacific and then rebounded and beat Davis and never looked back,” Mitchell said. “To be at home, this is where we should be taking care of business. We have one more and I think our team has seen throughout the year the different [situations].

Bryson finished with 14 points and five rebounds while Brown tallied 11 points and eight boards.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s encouraging that [Taran] got some boards,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “I think it’s encouraging that he got to the rim and got two dunks. It’s a step up for him.”</p>\n<p>The Titans were unable to slow down UCSB’s inside game as they were outscored 40-14 in the paint. Fullerton sported a four or five guard lineup for the entirety of the game, with its lone forward being 6’7” junior James ‘Deuce’ Douglas.</p>\n<p>Without senior guard D.J. Seeley and senior forward Sammy Yeager, Fullerton’s second and third leading scorers, the Titans looked nothing like the team that entered last night’s game as the eighth team in the nation in points scored per game with 78.4. The Titans’ 50 points is a season low, the previous season low in scoring being 55, which came in a loss to Pacific last weekend.</p>\n<p>“It was different than the first time we played them when they were just running and gunning,” Big Al said. “I think they wanted to save their legs because they didn’t have all their guys; they’re pretty banged up like we are. We played solid, we held them to one shot most of the time and we were able to get out in the break for our advantage.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton featured a usual offense for a high-scoring team, holding the ball at the top of the key, often waiting to attack until only 10 to 15 seconds remained on the shot clock. The Titans ranked either first or second in the conference in the three major shooting percentages entering the contest, but finished with an unusually low .200 three-point shooting percentage, .591 free throw percentage and .354 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>“When we were disciplined and moved the ball and got great shots … we were pretty effective,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “I had no idea they would come in, hold the ball and go delay. They played fast, but only in the last 15 seconds of the shot clock.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton featured an effective one-man full court press on UCSB’s point guard for the majority of the game, causing nine of the Gauchos’ 14 turnovers in the first half.</p>\n<p>Up 23-22 at the half, UCSB came out aggressive to open the second half, going on a 14-4 run and never trailing in the second half. UCSB outperformed Fullerton on the boards as well, outrebounding the Titans 42-25.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Nate Garth returned to action for UCSB after an eight game absence due to a left hamstring injury, but was limited in action, receiving only one minute of play. He will be the lone senior honored on Saturday for senior night.</p>\n<p>“He just brings a presence that you want to play harder,” Bryson said. “He’s a very smart basketball player, so it makes you want to play harder for him and play smarter. If he’s just with us, we’re going to be a better team.”</p>\n<p>Riverside previously defeated UCSB 54-45 at home, so the Gauchos will look for revenge against the Highlanders with a chance to officially lock up the seventh seed for next week’s Big West Conference Tournament in Anaheim.</p>\n<p>“It’s a new season now,” Big Al said. “We’re going to be happy for about five more minutes and get ready for Riverside on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff for Saturday’s contest against Riverside is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1447241361\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50577\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/local-organization-opposes-beach-revamp-asks-county-to-reevalute/mensbasketball_markbrocher_03-07-2013_dsc_1214/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1362687406\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"140\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50571\" alt=\"MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>MARK BROCHER/ DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
