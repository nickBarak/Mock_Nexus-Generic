This was all led by one tall, gap-toothed and loud individual who goes by the name of Tyler, the Creator. Combine this with a bunch of debauchery and banter from elderly folks claiming that their kids are being brainwashed, and you’ve got yourself a group called Odd Future. On the cusp of their infamy, they decided to take on a ridiculous festival that has come to be known as Camp Flog Gnaw. On the seventh year of its illustrious run, Tyler has taken the monumental Dodger Stadium and transformed it into a ballpark for misfits with a stacked lineup of prominent artists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two-day festival first emerged in the form of a carnival, established by the noteworthy ferris wheel overlooking Los Angeles.The foundation of the carnival is the youth who have loved Tyler’s outlandish approach to the music world and fashion and have stuck around to build an empire with the most diverse fanbase up to date. The dark night was filled with bodies wandering through the ballpark covered by sprinkles of ash from the forest fires and cradled by the eccentric music that pounded from bass-heavy speakers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the “Camp” and “Flog” stages provided lethal performances from impressive artists ranging from the likes of young Indie icons Rex Orange County and hypebeast phenomenon Playboi Carti to boy band Brockhampton, while the “Gnaw” stage had significantly lower numbers in comparison. Despite the terrible air conditions, attendees shined in fluorescent outfits to scounder through the new venue in search of the best way to get the most out of the first of the two-day festival. The stadium was perfectly designed with beautiful flower patterns; deep-fried food scents lingered throughout, and people lined up for classic “Adventureland”-esque ring tossing games. Ultimately, everyone found solace in jumping in or sitting around crowds to enjoy the music. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crowds moshed heavily during sets like that of Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti. His sticky ad-libs and braggadocious lyricism, combined with toxic instrumentals, unleashed savage behavior and raised everyone’s adrenaline to a maximum capacity. Meanwhile, Indie-heads simultaneously danced passionately on the opposite end of the venue to Rex Orange County tracks like “Loving Is Easy” and helped further establish how the festival is far from being filled with unidimensional music enthusiasts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kali Uchis took her sensuality to the stage to put on a stellar performance with guitar solos and a guest appearance from The Internet’s Steve Lacy — who also performed earlier in the day — for standout track “Your Teeth In My Neck.” After a passionate performance from the Flog Gnaw founder himself, Tyler, the Creator, during which he channeled a variety of faces to help sing along to tracks that ranged from “Goblin” to “Flower Boy” and at least one track from everything in between, the night capped off with a ruthless performance from the unapologetic “G.O.O.D Music” rapper Pusha T. The infamous rapper put on a pure, captivating performance, creating a diverse setlist with his latest fully Kanye West-produced project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daytona, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and songs from 2013’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Name Is My Name</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Pusha took the atmosphere to the next degree with live installments of Clipse track “Grindin’ ” and even his Kanye West collab “New God Flow” to close out the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before it even began, day two of the festival had established itself as legendary simply based off of the lineup of musical enigmas like Ms. Lauryn Hill and the Kid Cudi/Kanye West duo, Kids See Ghosts. Early on, people stood in enormous lines for the overpriced </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kids See Ghosts</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> merchandise and Camp Flog Gnaw memorabilia. Nevertheless, sets from Taco and even Jaden Smith made for a perfect ending to fans’ anticipations. Taco enthralled the audience with the furious pounding from his trap-heavy DJ set, and Smith’s enthusiasm kept the environment lively. Soon enough, class was in session as Ms. Lauryn Hill took the stage and entranced the crowd with beautiful ballads from her iconic debut, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It was truly an impactful moment as she held her very own resurgence of soul at the carnival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As time passed, bodies rushed to the “Camp” stage and moved in close for Kids See Ghosts. The Cudi-Kanye dynamic duo hovered in a glass box that towered over the stage. The crowd flooded in as Metro Boomin’s signature line, “If Young Metro don’t trust you I’m gon’ shoot you,” played and the beat dropped in their collaborative effort, “Father Stretch My Hands Pt.1,” off of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Life of Pablo.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The two icons went through all seven tracks from their </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kids See Ghosts</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> album and dabbled in playing classic anthems like “Paranoid” and “Pursuit of Happiness.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the two jumped inside the transparent cube, voices joined and screamed lyric after lyric. In this crowd, along with the many others of the two days, there was one frequent face that shined with the most profound responses. Tyler sang along and danced to different performances with a genuine passion in such a childlike manner, proving that he’s honed his own personal playground and shares his enthusiasm for virtuosity. Tyler and Odd Future’s impact has been incredible and crucial for motivating the youth’s creativity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camp Flog Gnaw will forever provide a unique home for those who were stigmatized as slackers for wilding out to classic </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bastard</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-era Tyler, the Creator, trying to skate around and find for a place of acceptance. Although his own content has changed quite a bit, Tyler’s influence remains unchallenged and consequently proves just how significant of a role Camp Flog Gnaw plays in the live festival scene.

live. Musical artists are often solely defined by their music, but live performances allow for personalities and talent to shine in a way that earbuds could never replicate. Hozier, a 29 year old from Ireland, made me realize this with his incredible performance at the Santa Barbara Bowl last weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I bought tickets for his concert a few months ago with my friend for the experience of seeing live music. I’m from New York City, so going to an outdoor concert in California seemed like a dream — and I wasn’t wrong.</span><b> </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s an absolute pleasure to be standing in front of you in this extraordinarily beautiful part of the world,” Hozier said in his opening statement to the audience. With the ocean in sight, the colorful lights on stage, the trees swaying and the showgoers exuding good energy, the concert felt like paradise. More than that, Hozier surprised everyone by being extremely funny, relatable and more talented live than any recording could hope to express. Music should be an outlet from the constant thoughts flooding our minds, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a way to manifest our emotions </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and just something to dance to —  his concert had it all. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hozier started the show with a song dedicated to a girl in the crowd, making us all feel closer to him; he was no longer a mysterious character behind his music. To the girl in the crowd he said, “It was a pleasure to meet you … you know why.” With that being said, he began to sing and my friends and I started to sway endlessly to his music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Hozier has enough talent and personality to stand alone, he formed quite an iconic duo alongside violinist Emily Kohavi. She was wearing a grunge outfit comprised of Doc Marten boots and a mini skirt, her hair pulled back in a ponytail that she swung in sync with the music. The pair would often face each other and jam while constantly switching instruments. From concert violin to the electric guitar, Kohavi matched Hozier’s classic and electric guitar with fiery energy that lit up the whole stage. Each song was accompanied by a colored light projection and background video, which gave the tracks more character and provided a better understanding of what Hozier wanted the audience to take away from them.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90904\" style=\"width: 1451px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_5-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"584199959\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"90881\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90904\" data-attachment-id=\"90904\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/hozier-takes-the-santa-barbara-bowl-to-church/hozier_siavash-ghadiri_online_5-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_5-1.jpg?fit=1441%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1441,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Hozier_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_5-1.jpg?fit=176%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_5-1.jpg?fit=721%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90904\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_5-1.jpg?resize=888%2C1262\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1262\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_5-1.jpg?w=1441&amp;ssl=1 1441w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_5-1.jpg?resize=176%2C250&amp;ssl=1 176w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_5-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1092&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_5-1.jpg?resize=721%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 721w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90904\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The genre of Hozier’s work is categorized as blues, indie rock, soul and contemporary R&amp;B, but more importantly his music is simply the kind you want to sing along to. Hozier led the crowd to start singing the classic “oohs” to the song “To Be Alone,” while he said, “There is a light at the end of the tunnel but you have to let me fucking get you there.” The energy from the crowd singing and laughing in that moment is something that I will never forget. Somehow, we were all connected with the lighthearted energy Hozier projected from the stage; it was incredible. Together, we sang and danced with him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the song “To Be Alone” finished, Hozier continued to showcase the wit that he had been unveiling to us the whole night. “The best part about being in Santa Barbara is that you’re about a ten-minute Uber ride from the sun.” He wasn’t wrong ⁠— I mean it’s almost November and it has been 90 degrees out recently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Hozier had already established a friendly rapport with the audience, his level of intimacy expanded even further as he introduced to us a new song, “Jack Boot Jump,” set to release on his new album this coming winter. “Please avoid filming and put the phone away for a bit … or actually, in general, suffer being present for a moment I suppose,” Hozier said. This is exactly what being at his concert felt like, a place where everyone was in the present moment — no midterms, jobs, worries or text messages followed anyone into the venue. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90894\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_17-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1361229647\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"90881\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90894\" data-attachment-id=\"90894\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/hozier-takes-the-santa-barbara-bowl-to-church/hozier_siavash-ghadiri_online_17-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_17-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Hozier_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_17-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_17-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90894\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_17-1.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_17-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_17-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_17-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_17-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hozier_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_17-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the highlights was of course his famous “Take Me to Church,” which had the entire audience on their feet. The “amen” was angelic with everyone in attendance singing along; thankfully Hozier and his group’s voices overpowered ours, which made it sound so good. The highlight songs were definitely “Jackie and Wilson,” “Almost (Sweet Music),” “Someone New,” “Sedated” and “From Eden,” which had the whole crowd harmonizing with him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hozier repeatedly shouted out his group with Alex Ryan on bass and keyboard, Rory Doyle on the drums, Rachel Beauregarddoing vocals and percussion, Kristen Rogers with stunning vocals, Jessica Barry on keys, Cormac Curran on the organ and Kohavi killing the violin and guitar. They are an extremely talented group and their individual performances were breathtaking ⁠— the harmonies between Beauregard and Santo, Ryan’s bass solos and gripping jump finishes, Doyle’s banger beats, Curran’s booming organ, Barry’s beautiful vocals while playing the piano, Kohavi’s fierceness on the violin and Hozier’s enchanting guitar and vocals were all enchanting. They finished the concert with “Work Song” and the crowd went wild one last time. A red background was projected on stage and the crowd swayed together while singing along — it was a beautiful ending to an amazing night. Hozier is definitely loved by all of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><em><i>Corrections: An earlier version of the article misnamed the singer Suzanne Santo.

Artists like Pharrell Williams, for example, who seem to have production credits and contributions all over in pop culture, are rarely cited for their actual solo work, becoming (unfairly) more of an image than a powerful solo musician. Toro Y Moi has often been placed into this strange and often inaccurate box of music culture; he’s been seemingly everywhere across genre and style and influence. Any music fan can recognize his face and fashion, yet strangely enough, he is not praised for his music to the same degree that he should be. Despite all of this, Chaz Bear, more frequently known as Toro Y Moi, proves through his live presence and energy that he is a great performer despite these constraints, standing alone as not only an iconic image but also a major influence and pioneer of 21st century indie music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toro Y Moi hit downtown Santa Barbara’s SOhO last Thursday for a stop on his tour following his </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boo Boo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> album release and after announcing a new album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outer Peace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is coming early 2019. With a long, successful career and a ton of commercial buzz, Chaz beautifully arrived on stage, maintaining a delicate balance of high energy and chill waves and prompting one of the danciest crowds I’ve ever seen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaz began his set with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boo Boo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> album opener “Mirage,” which was met with a strong response from the audience. The energy didn’t reach full potential, however, until he performed his new single, “Freelance,” soon after, which seemed to be the true start of the night. Toro himself was alternating between keys, a beat pad and solo vocals, meshing seamlessly with his incredibly rehearsed backing band.

This moment in particular marked some of the highest audience involvement, with nearly everyone singing along to the catchy hook and dancing with the grooves. Despite the electronic-heavy landscape of “Boo Boo,” the live setting translated alarmingly well, with every 808 drum, groovy baseline and synth chord hitting hard and true. Much of the magic that Chaz Bear presents here lies in turning his recorded dreams into a live reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In person, Toro Y Moi was about as quaint and down-to-earth as I had imagined. He was a man of few words between songs and seemed to say more in performance than anything else. His movement and engagement were limited, yet effective, which made for a very intimate and immersive show. This mysterious and somewhat reclusive element of Toro is a bit of a staple of his image, and it proved extremely effective once paired with the strong backing band and lighting choreography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the more exciting moments mid-set came from Toro’s early classic album, 2013’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything in Return</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some of these deeper cuts worked as a nod to his more dedicated fans and provided a change of pace from the other tracks in the set. Moving emotional tracks like “Say That” and “So Many Details” were memorable moments at SOhO, and they personally took me back to my high school days when </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything in Return</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was first released. Toro Y Moi wrapped up his set with classic hit “Rose Quartz,” a track that is lodged in the memory of any true fan of Chaz’s music and one that marked the start of a huge career. The performance was extremely powerful in its nostalgic nature and celebratory tone, ending the night where a lot of Toro’s fans began with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toro Y Moi is a total icon, not only in image and cultural positioning but also in diverse musicianship, intimate performative value and sheer, raw talent. If a look into his discography doesn’t prove this, surely some time in his live setting will. After an incredibly fun and ultimately moving night at SOhO, I can assure you that Toro Y Moi isn’t going anywhere but forward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Co-op garage. A few couches accommodate hushed conversations amongst those already there, and any newcomer’s pre-existing social anxiety dissolves into the dim lights and welcoming energy. Some people have never been here before, but the Biko House has a way of making them feel right at home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranging from experimental folk to gothic electronica, an array of local and touring talent showcased their music at the Biko House in an event organized by Funzone on Oct. 17. This recurring DIY event operates under the mission of providing an accessible, diverse and substance-free music community to the Santa Barbara area. Bands such as Deanne Bunn, Diatom Deli, Serpent Season and Roper Rider entertained an intimate crowd of less than 30 attendees on what could have been another boring Wednesday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the time most of the people who come to these shows don’t know the bands who are playing, so it’s always exciting to see what’ll happen,” Serpent Season’s Randall Leong, a UCSB alumnus, said. “It should get pretty weird, probably.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leong, once a Biko House resident, returned to play at this event for the same reason he became involved years ago: the ability to share his music in an environment where creativity is celebrated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the spirit of festivity, Serpent Season wore Halloween masks as they strummed electric guitars to their self-described sound of “dreary, ambient folk.” With a single set of string lights illuminating behind them in the dark room, it felt like a live rendition of the scoring to a “Stranger Things” episode.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even the murals gracing the perimeter of the space introduced a newfound form of expression to the audience, especially as it mutated underneath a projector screening psychedelic images.

The garage space in particular functions as an all-purpose space for the community, hosting events such as art exhibitions and small concerts. The environment not only attracts performers and attendees alike, but is highly valued by those who live there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the best thing I’ve ever been apart of at UCSB and I wish I had lived at Biko last year, too,” fourth-year philosophy major Isabella D’Alessandro said. “It’s cool because things like this are so accessible, they’ve definitely been a highlight of my time here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event wouldn’t have been possible, however, without the help of Funzone. Once a location in downtown Santa Barbara, Funzone now operates through Facebook as a key organizational element for booking shows in the area. Working with radio station KCSB to promote events such as these, they are able to foster a space of music for all ages and give underheard bands a platform for exposure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Not only for high school students, but even at UCSB there are a lot of kids that are under 21 that can’t go to half of what happens downtown,” Spencer Von Hershman, Santa Barbara resident and creator of Funzone, said. “It’s a nice other option for people who don’t want to party all the time, or simply aren’t interested in partying at all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing an environment that unifies similar-minded people with something that they are passionate about is the ultimate goal of performances like Wednesday evening’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just a safe place to mess around, no one here is judgemental. People want to hang out with nice people who are here to enjoy themselves and be respectful,” Von Hershman said. “Santa Barbara is a really good community for that.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84776\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84776\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/experimental-folk-and-electronic-sounds-saturate-biko-garage/","id":6608,"author":{"id":689,"name":"Nicole Szczepanek"},"related":[6607,6606,6605],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
