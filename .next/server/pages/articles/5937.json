Winters delivered this one-liner during UCSB’s sixth annual Talent Trade, which took place March 7-8. The two-day conference featured talent industry professionals who discussed where they have been and how they got there. From learning how to brand oneself to finding the right agency, a wealth of knowledge filtered through a room on the fourth floor of the SSMS building.</p>\n<p>Like Winters, most of the panelists were former Gauchos. According to Talent Trade’s organizer Danielle Hakimi, alumni were the contacts who confirmed the quickest interest.</p>\n<p>“There’s a certain pride that comes with it — [Alums think] ‘I’m graduated, and now I’m successful,’” Hakimi said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Hakimi directs the purposely lower-cased “mab productions,” an organization which produces events and shows with the hopes of bridging UCSB’s film and theater departments. A third-year theater major, Hakimi is optimistic about mab’s role as a liaison.</p>\n<p>“[The theater department] has actors, designers, directors, people interested in writing and producing. People in the film department make films, look for actors, look for all these people who are five minutes away from them,” Hakimi said.</p>\n<p>Mab productions inherited the Talent Trade conference this year and made it a primary goal to meld together people from both departments. The final group was small — around 25 members — but the smallness allowed students to deeply connect with panelists. Casual networking occurred throughout the weekend, creating what Hakimi calls “a genuine connection.”</p>\n<p>While each session brought its own share of guidance, the agents’ workshop offered tons of practical advice. Here’s a choice selection of tips given by former-gauchos-turned-agents Sarah Agronow, Jackson Gibbon and Winters.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Becoming an actor: Get on Vine and YouTube. Tom Spriggs, a talent manager/producer who was also on the Talent Trade roster, scans YouTube on a daily basis for talent. The main draw is that successful videos already have a following and are marketable to a concrete number. Scrolling through YouTube led Spriggs to finding “Bath Boys,” a comedy group who has since then started doing movies.</li>\n<li>Moving to L.A.: Pick an apartment in Hollywood, Silver Lake or Culver City so you do not have to meander too far from the scene. Three months is the quickest anyone gets a real job, so be prepared for the starving artist life and eating Top Ramen every night.</li>\n<li>Making rent money: Work as a extra in a film or TV show for around $80 a day, or serve in a clap audience for TV sitcoms. Winters was an excellent clapper.</li>\n<li>Finding an agent: Get the phone number of your mom’s best friend’s nephew who has a friend with a brother who works for an agency. Contact them and offer to buy them coffee. Whatever you do, do not solicit at agency front desks and hand random people your headshots. Agronow works at a boutique agency that serves Danny Trejo (“Machete”) and throws lots of headshots away. Occasionally, she will save the funny ones — like man with Chet Faker facial hair and bowtie — to show at seminars like Talent Trade.</li>\n<li>Making an agent like you: Befriend their assistant, because they have all the power. As an agent assistant, Winters handpicked everyone his boss looked at. To get through the first line of defense, buy the assistant coffee and be extraordinarily courteous on the phone.</li>\n<li>Getting a job: Realize that cherry picking is a thing, and figure out your brand, aka that special thing that makes you marketable. Winters told a story about how the man who wrote “The Pirates of the Caribbean” branded himself as “the pirate guy” for several years before the multi-billion-dollar franchise got picked up.</li>\n<li>Getting another job: Gibbon recommended being easy to work with at your first job so that producers will recommend you for another gig. This means coming in on time, knowing your lines and avoiding on-set substance abuse. Apparently Tom Sizemore (“Black Hawk Down”) brought prostitutes to the set and would be engulfed with baking soda in the bathroom for hours. Don’t be that actor.</li>\n<li>Writing a screenplay: Carry a notebook, always. Winters advised to outline ideas fully until you nail the plotline and have an ending.</li>\n<li>Hating L.A. traffic: The general consensus was that L.A. traffic is terrible and will always be terrible, so find podcasts that you love and form a relationship with your car. Winters is always the only one laughing hysterically on the 405 while everyone else sulks into boredom and anger.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since it was an agents’ panel, advice on how to become Ari Gold from “Entourage” was included in the discussion. The main thing to know is that it is a holistically strenuous job. Winters reported that a lead agent at Innovative smashed cell phones with a hammer, while Gibbon ensured that angry spats are “99 percent about them, not about you.”</p>\n<p>The alphabet soup of top agencies to work for was poured out: CAA, UTA and WME. Creative Artists Agency (CAA) is the most prestigious of them all and has weird agent rules like no cell phone use when you’re a freshman. (Hence hammer-smashing). United Talent Agency (UTA) specializes in hot, new talent so they are a solid base for newbie actors. William Morris Endeavor (WME) is the largest agency in the world and supports giants like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington.</p>\n<p>Despite the large amount of celebrity name-dropping that occurred throughout Talent Trade, the conference was largely a casual experience. Panelists talked to attendees without PowerPoint or rehearsed dialogue. Attendees left dry-cleaned slacks at home and wore faded jeans and hooded sweatshirts. Sandwich lunches complete with juice and granola bars were shared amongst everyone. The air of informality was crisp and non-threatening.</p>\n<p>And yet, the informality made the conference all the better. Things didn’t get overcomplicated with resumes or dress code, and the casual attitude everyone held brought genuine connections throughout the weekend. The workshops were a bit ragtag at times, but all in all everyone walked out armed with ideas on how to join the Talent Industry after college.</p>\n<p>In addition to Talent Trade, the Film and Media Dept. has a large repertoire of events such as Word Farm, Reel Loud, Cam Con and the Digital Film Festival.

The injunction proposed that these individuals not be allowed in certain parts of Santa Barbara, which they refer to as “safety zones.” The rationale behind the gang injunction is to decrease criminal activity by preventing these individuals from associating with each other in the safety zones, wearing certain types of clothing, possessing weapons, using drugs or alcohol and recruiting for their gang in the safety zones. In addition, these 30 individuals would have to sign a legal document with the city attorney in which they formally surrender their affiliation with their gang.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In theory this injunction would decrease the gang activity in Santa Barbara, however, there are many problems with the gang injunction. One of the biggest concerns about the gang injunction is that there has been little to no transparency; there have not been any public hearings by the Santa Barbara City Council. The public is deliberately being excluded despite the fact that the injunction would have a great impact on the Santa Barbara residents and family.</p>\n<p>Another problem with the gang injunction is the people who are on the list, which are added solely based on subjective police discretion. A few of the individuals on the list have been able to turn their lives around, including some who are currently attending Santa Barbara City College. If the proposed gang injunction goes into effect these individuals would no longer be able to attend SBCC because it is part of the safety zones, which they would not be allowed in. This is problematic and counterproductive because the point of the gang injunction is to reduce criminal activity, however, banning them from SBCC would do nothing to keep these alleged gang members off of the streets. Instead of preventing these individuals from getting an education they should be encouraged to get educated. In addition, some of the people on the list are currently in prison, so there is something to be said about why these people were even placed on the list if they currently cannot go to the safety zones. Perhaps the answer to this question could reveal a hidden agenda. Proponents of the gang injunction are taking advantage of this vulnerable population and attacking them to make it seem like they have control over the crime in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the gang injunction would infringe upon the basic civil rights of the 30 individuals on the list and their families. People should not be told where they can and cannot go especially when some of the people were unjustly placed on the list. In addition, the gang injunction promotes ethnic profiling. Law enforcement is basing their decision to place people on the list based on the individual’s race or ethnicity.</p>\n<p>It has been estimated that the gang injunction has already cost over $500,000 in court filings and proceedings, and it has not even been implemented yet. Instead of spending all of this money on court filings and proceedings, Santa Barbara should be investing in gang prevention and intervention programs. By doing so, Santa Barbara could unite and work in cooperation with various agencies, schools, communities and recreational programs to provide alternatives to gang involvement.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, May 14 the Santa Barbara City Council will be addressing the gang injunction, and it is important for people to get involved and voice their opinions because of the impact the injunction will have on the Santa Barbara community. Someone needs to be a stop on this injunction, which promotes ethnic profiling and criminalization of people of color living in the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p><em>Brenda Maldonado is a UCSB alumna and is currently a graduate student at USC’s School of Social Work.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at dailynexus.com on Friday, May0, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51315\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/concerned-alum-speaks-out-against-sbs-gang-induction/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51315\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/concerned-alum-speaks-out-against-sbs-gang-induction/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/concerned-alum-speaks-out-against-sbs-gang-induction/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/concerned-alum-speaks-out-against-sbs-gang-induction/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/concerned-alum-speaks-out-against-sbs-gang-induction/","id":5934,"author":{"id":472,"name":"Brenda Maldonado"},"related":[5933,5932,5931],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ecological Storytelling Screens Miyazaki Classic: “Nausicaä of Valley of the Wind”","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind_592x299.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind_592x299.jpg?resize=592%2C299&ssl=1","description":"Graduate student Jeremy Chow from UCSB’s English department hosted the screening of the animated film “Nausicaä of Valley of the Wind” on Friday in South Hall room 2635.

For Nausicaä and the surviving inhabitants of the Earth, life is dominated by interactions with the ever-growing Toxic Jungle that was spawned in the aftermath of the war. The Jungle and the massive insects that evolved to protect it threaten mankind with extinction as they relentlessly consume the remaining human kingdoms, which are plagued by war and starvation. Confronted with this bleak reality, Princess Nausicaä devotes herself to understanding the mysteries of the Toxic Jungle to see if there is any hope for humanity to coexist with the Jungle and its giant insect guardians.</p>\n<p>Miyazaki cements his trademark motif of strong female lead characters in the film, with Princess Nausicaä Kushana fighting to defend the relatively prosperous Valley of the Wind from an invading army led by Princess Kushana, who seeks to revive a “Giant Warrior” from the Seven Days of Fire 1000 years prior. With the misguided plan of using it to “burn down the Toxic Jungle” and destroy the insects, Kushana battles with the militaries of other kingdoms in a desperate struggle for control of the Warrior and the fate of the planet. Ironically, as Nausicaä later discovers, the monstrous Giant Warriors and their weapons helped create the Toxic Jungle in the first place and that the Jungle is actually purifying the Earth of mankind’s past pollution.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The film’s strong environmental message, while laid on thick, is delivered in such a compelling and frightening manner it makes James Cameron’s “Avatar” and “Elysium” look like child’s play. In “Nausicaä,” the consequences of ecological degradation are taken to far more horrifying extremes, with the end of the human race seemingly inevitable. Despite the doom and gloom atmosphere, Princess Nausicaä’s optimism (or naïveté) that a different future is possible both bewilders and inspires.</p>\n<p>“Nausicaä” also conveys a subtler, yet equally powerful anti-nuclear message. In one of the most bizarre and mesmerizing scenes of the film, Kushana deploys a prematurely hatched Giant Warrior, essentially a living tactical nuclear weapon, against a stampeding horde of attacking insects with devastating effect. Kushana’s lieutenant, upon witnessing the enormous explosion caused by the Warrior remarks, “Incredible, no wonder the Earth was incinerated.”</p>\n<p>First-year English major Casey Coffee agreed the Giant Warrior was “allegorical for nuclear war,” given the context of the director’s early childhood living in Japan during the Second World War.</p>\n<p>“When it shot the beam out of its mouth, that explosion was definitely reminiscent of a cloud of destruction, and since Hayao Miyazaki is Japanese, I could definitely make a connection,” Coffee said.</p>\n<p>Every scene of the film is set upon a beautifully hand-painted background that brings each frame to life. The steampunk-style anime crafted by Miyazaki in the film creates a visually stunning futuristic world in which certain aspects of technology are far advanced, most notably Princess Nausicaä’s jet glider, while others remain primitive and medieval in style. Soldiers wield swords, wear plated armor and tunics, yet simultaneously drive tanks and pilot fighter jets. The contrast and contradiction between elements of the new and the old feel increasingly natural as plot unfolds and the verisimilitude kicks in. Somehow, Miyazaki makes it work.</p>\n<p>Second-year English major Hue-An Tran said she appreciated the unique, intentionally over-the-top style used by Miyazaki in “Nausicaä.”</p>\n<p>“The comicbook-style action sequences I thought was pretty retro and cool, because I know a lot of his other films aren’t like that,” Tran said.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most fantastic feature of “Nausicaä” is its beautiful original score by composer Joe Hisaishi, which elevates the emotional impact of the films most gripping scenes, and is occasionally nothing short of enchanting. Though the film was originally released in 1984, it was masterfully dubbed in English and rereleased in 2005, with voiceovers from an impressive A-list cast including Patrick Stewart, Uma Thurman, Shia LaBeouf, Edward James Olmos and Mark Hammond.</p>\n<p>More than 30 years later, “Nausicaä” remains a must-see for anyone with a taste for epic storytelling, quality science-fiction or just film in general. If you limit yourself from seeing this film because you “don’t like anime,” then you are missing out on a true work of art. There is a reason “Nausicaä” was selected as one of the few animated films screened by Turner Classic Movies because, at the end of the day, it is just a damn good movie.</p>\n<p>The event was hosted as part of an ongoing series through the Environmental Humanities Initiative. The next movie to be shown by the group will be “Princess Mononoke” on May 28.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63838\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/ecological-storytelling-screens-miyazaki-classic-nausicaa-of-valley-of-the-wind/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63838\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/ecological-storytelling-screens-miyazaki-classic-nausicaa-of-valley-of-the-wind/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/ecological-storytelling-screens-miyazaki-classic-nausicaa-of-valley-of-the-wind/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/ecological-storytelling-screens-miyazaki-classic-nausicaa-of-valley-of-the-wind/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/ecological-storytelling-screens-miyazaki-classic-nausicaa-of-valley-of-the-wind/","id":5935,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[5934,5933,5932],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Luhrmann’s Gatsby: Give It a Chance, Old Sport","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I’m not sure if one can be addicted to literature, or to the abstract theories and opinions of said works, but if so, I’m in need of a support group and a 12-step plan.

However, I have recently found a new argumentative vice, and it is of course, Big Baz’s <em>Gatsby.</em></p>\n<p>The overwhelming media attention the book and film have received in the past year because of Baz Luhrmann’s film adaptation makes the inner rebel in me hesitant to claim <em>The Great Gatsby</em> as my favorite book. But who am I kidding? I’ve read the thing cover to cover over 10 times. In my mind, there is no text superior to the legend that F. Scott Fitzgerald created in 1925. I feel it is my duty as a devout <em>Gatsby</em> groupie to tell you why all of the critics who have trashed the movie are ﬂamingly false.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The problem here is that most critics have ignored major components of both the novel and film in their reviews, and to paraphrase Einstein, we can’t be judging ﬁsh on their tree-climbing abilities. First, as I mentioned before, this ﬁlm is an adaptation. To adapt means to make suitable for a new use or purpose. There is no way to translate a book exactly to the big screen. This is primarily because there is neither enough time, nor is it possible for a director to match every reader’s individual understanding of the text. <em>Gatsby</em> has been made into a ﬁlm six times, and Baz Luhrmann needed to make this adaptation of <em>Gatsby</em> unique.</p>\n<p>Unique is also a way to describe Luhrmann. Any ﬁlm buff can recognize his work in an instant. He has his own style just like Tarantino and the Coen brothers. If you were to go into the new <em>Gatsby</em> expecting Robert Redford in a white suit while a soft jazz number plays in the background, you’re in for a surprise. This movie is abstract art — it is not literal, classical or straightforward by any means.</p>\n<p>When we meet Daisy in the novel, Fitzgerald describes the wind as it “blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale ﬂags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.” This is the kind of imagery Baz is working with here, people; get with it. To do these fantastic, romantic images justice, he’s got to have one hell of an artistic vision.</p>\n<p>And Luhrmann knows how to throw a party. Those who claim the festivities at Gatsby’s mansion were overdone must have missed Nick’s descriptions of Gatsby’s soirees. Luhrmann did not overstretch his creative license by throwing in a couple swimming pools and a few hundred dancing attendees. The ﬁlm’s soundtrack, produced by hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, has been criticized for being too modern, which is perhaps the most frustrating hater-ade. This ﬁlm wouldn’t have worked with a classical jazz soundtrack. For example: The scene in Tom Buchanan’s apartment was breathtaking because it was a genuine, hot, sweaty, drunken mess. Tell me, Isla Vista — how can you argue that “Into the Past” by Nero was inappropriately featured in that scene? None of you hooligans can deny that raging dubstep makes for a great party.</p>\n<p>As great as the parties were, the most outstanding feature of this ﬁlm is the incredible acting. Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan was just enough of a pompous, vulgar brute to make him and his love for Daisy the foil to Gatsby. Edgerton’s Tom succeeds because he has a protective and conﬁdent air about him that shows how Daisy, among others in the film, could be enamored with him. Tobey Maguire is a cutie. I think he was sincerely engaging enough to elicit empathy and trust from the audience, as Nick Carraway does in the original text. Daisy may be one of the most difﬁcult acting challenges a woman could face, up there with Blanche DuBois and Lady Macbeth, and Carey Mulligan does it with both grace and ease. The ﬁnal ensemble scene at the plaza sealed the deal for me — her pain, frustration and fear, all bundled into a few streaming tears and a slight shudder of the shoulders, was truly mesmerizing.</p>\n<p>And last, I will avoid obsessively praising the wonder that is Leonardo DiCaprio. In brief, he brought something to Gatsby that I have never encountered before. He clearly and honestly demonstrates Gatsby’s absolute commitment to Daisy and their life together. It was an impeccable performance.</p>\n<p>I understand why someone who loves the book could have been disappointed. There was an overall lack of development in Nick’s character and a near complete omission of the love affair he had with Jordan. There were some cheesy shots of ﬁreworks and googly-eyed Tobey Maguire that seemed a bit overdone; I’m not personally into 3-D, so that felt superﬂuous.</p>\n<p>However, in terms of adapting this novel (which I personally believe is too perfect for its own good) into a visually and emotionally stimulating experience, Luhrmann accomplished the near impossible.</p>\n<p><em>Nika Burnett is a second-year acting and philosophy double major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of the May 28, 2013 print edition of the <em>Nexus.</em></h6>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
