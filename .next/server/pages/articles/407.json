They combined for 46 points on 18-35 shooting and made 9-15 attempts at the free throw line. Green led the team with 24 points and was 5-5 at the line while Ogwumike scored 22 points and was 4-10 shooting free throws.</p>\n<p>Compared to Pepperdine’s field goal percentage of 35 percent and its three-point percentage of 20 percent, UCSB had a stronger performance shooting, 41.4 percent from the field and meagerly were better from three with a 28.6 percentage.</p>\n<p>However, the Waves’ 71.1 free throw percentage was better than Santa Barbara’s 55.6 percentage and proved to be the deciding factor in Sunday’s game.</p>\n<p>Leading the Waves’ 11-2 run to begin the game was Ogwumike with seven points. Despite allowing the scoring run, a make from beyond the arc by Roper sparked UCSB’s 11-0 run to take a 13-11 lead, forced a Pepperdine timeout and eventually ended with a 15-15 tie to end the quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ 28-27 lead with 2:35 left in the second quarter would be their last of the game. But jumpshots by Jones and sophomore forward Chaya Durr resulted in UCSB trailing 32-33 at the end of the first half. Durr registered a game-high 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s 10-point, 48-38 lead was its largest of the game at the 3:21 mark of the third quarter.  Contributing to the lead was the duo of Green and Ogwumike, scoring 17 points. The Waves’ lead lasted until the 1:43 mark of the quarter but was trimmed to 48-54 by UCSB’s 6-1 run to end the third.</p>\n<p>Two layups by Jones for UCSB, a layup by Ogwumike and a free throw for Pepperdine were scored to start the fourth quarter prior to neither team scoring for nearly the next two minutes.</p>\n<p>Similar to UCSB, Pepperdine found itself in foul trouble as well, committing a total of 28 fouls. But, ending the game’s scoreless streak was Roper, making a pair of free throws. Her ability to make free throws was most crucial in the fourth quarter as she made 10-11 and scored 14 points in the quarter.</p>\n<p>A missed layup by Pepperdine freshman guard Kayla Blair led to senior Dioseline Lopez scoring a layup to bring the Gauchos within two at 69-71. This prompted Santa Barbara’s plan to intentionally foul which landed Ogwumike at the free throw line.</p>\n<p>Ogwumike missed both free throw attempts while Jones grabbed the rebound for UCSB and led to the Gauchos calling a timeout with five seconds remaining in regulation. With little time remaining, Lopez attempted a game-winning three-pointer but came up short as UCSB loss 69-71.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has struggled to consistently knock down free throws in each game so far this season. Its 53.3 free throw percentage on Friday certainly was an influence in its loss.</p>\n<p>Season-highs in scoring, field goal and three-point percentage still weren’t enough in UCSB’s contest against Wyoming on Friday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 50 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from behind the three-point line to score 67 points, but a series of scoring runs in the second half and their ability to make free throws helped the Cowgirls defeat UCSB 76-67. Wyoming made 27-35 free throws for a 77.1 percentage.</p>\n<p>It was a career night for freshman shooting guard Coco Miller, recording career-highs with 24 points, four steals, and two blocks.</p>\n<p>A total of four Wyoming players scored 12 or more points on Friday. The Cowgirls established their offensive dominance early, opening the first quarter with a 10-2 run. Wyoming outscored UCSB 19-8 to finish the quarter. Combining for 12 of the team’s points were senior guard Marquelle Dent and freshman forward Marta Gomez. They ended the first with six points apiece as Dent shot 3-3 and Gomez went 2-3 from long distance.</p>\n<p>Dent led Wyoming in points with 17 and had a game-high six assists while Gomez was just one-point behind her lead with 16.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara a just three fouls in the first quarter but would commit many more through the second quarter and beyond, allowing Wyoming to build upon its lead at the free throw line. Wyoming’ largest lead of 15 points appeared in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB responded with a 9-0 run of its own to trim the Cowgirls’ lead to 21-27. Scoring Santa Barbara’s last five points to close the quarter was Miller as the Gauchos trailed 28-34 to head into halftime. Her performance in the second quarter was most pivotal as she scored 10 of her 24 points.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB managed to bring Wyoming’s lead within a single figure deficit, the emergence of senior guard Jordan Kelley to start the second half increased the Cowgirls’ lead back to double digits. She scored Wyoming’s first seven points to begin the third quarter to extend their lead to 41-31. Kelley concluded the game with 13 points and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>Helping UCSB to counter Wyoming’s scoring was its bench, outscoring the Cowgirls 26-9. Providing a career-high 11 points off the bench was sophomore small forward Taylor Farris to go along with a team-high five rebounds.</p>\n<p>An 8-0 run to close out the third quarter helped UCSB reduce Wyoming’s lead as a three-point basket by Miller brought Santa Barbara within four at 51-55. But the Gauchos found themselves down by double-figures at the start of the fourth quarter as Wyoming went on a 7-0 run to take a 62-51 lead with 8:17 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB’s 11 steals was its second-highest this season, Wyoming‘s 14 free throw attempts in the fourth quarter was its most throughout the entirety of the game and ultimately led the Cowgirls to their 76-67 win over UCSB. Dent shot all nine of her free throw attempts in the quarter, making seven and scoring nine points in the fourth. Nearly perfect from the line was sophomore guard Liv Roberts, finishing 8-9 at the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin the month of December hosting Santa Clara this Tuesday in the Thunderdome at 7:00 p.m. Currently on a four-game winning streak, the Broncos are 4-2 overall and beat UCSB 47-33 in last season’s matchup in Santa Barbara.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Looking to end a two-game losing streak, the UCSB men’s basketball team travels north to face San Francisco tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m. This will be the first of a nine-game stretch in which the Gauchos play eight times away from home.</p>\n<p>Losses to No. 14 Cal and Oregon St. have Santa Barbara at 1-2 overall through three games. Despite only playing one game at home thus far, the Dons have gotten off to an impressive 3-1 start to the season.</p>\n<p>Establishing a flow on the offensive end will be one of the keys for the Gauchos at this early point in the season as they look to replace their offensive focal point from the last three seasons in Alan Williams. While they went 5-2 without Big Al last year, they haven’t found as much success this season, already matching their loss total in games without him and shooting just 36.2 percent overall and 23.4 from three-point range as a team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The starting backcourt of reigning Big West Freshman of the Year Gabe Vincent and Eric Childress have struggled, with 25.8 and 31.3 percent marks overall, respectively.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson is the team’s top scorer, averaging 18.5 points a game. He has spent nearly every minute on the court after missing the first game due to suspension, leading the way at 38 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>Senior forward John Green has stepped nicely into his role as the No. 2 offensive option, being the only Gaucho to record double-digit scoring numbers through the first three games and averaging 16.7 per contest.

It will be very beneficial to the guard-heavy Gauchos if they can establish Beeler as an inside presence. While the team has struggled with shooting efficiency, the 6’10” senior has gone 9-12 over the last two games.</p>\n<p>San Francisco has already notched a couple of close wins this season, most recently a 58-57 victory over UC Riverside on Saturday on a game-winning layup by senior guard Tim Derksen with two seconds left.</p>\n<p>The Dons are led by Devin Watson, who scored a career-high 27 points in the win over the Highlanders. His 19.5 points per game is tops on the team, but he has been able to put up big numbers thanks to his average of over six free throw makes per game.</p>\n<p>After putting up 11 points and 13 boards on Saturday, Derksen has two double-doubles through four games. He is the team’s second leading scorer at 12.5 points and 8.5 rebounds a night.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Chase Foster has been knocking down the long ball this season, shooting 47.4 percent from three to give him 8.8 points per contest.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to end their two-game skid tonight at 7:30 at the Sobrato Center in San Francisco.</p><div

A jumper by senior forward Methlyn Onogomuho with 6:08 left in the half put UCI up 15-13, capping off a 10-0 run.</p>\n<p>UCSB once again took the lead with just over two minutes before the half, as senior center Clair Watkins’ lay-up put her team up 19-18. This would be the Gauchos’ last lead of the game, as Irvine’s sophomore guard Irene Chavez took over from there.</p>\n<p>Just before the half ended, Chavez knocked down back-to-back three-pointers to give her team a 24-19 lead heading into the break. Jemerigbe put in a lay-up to start the second half, cutting the Anteaters’ lead to three before Chavez answered right back with a jumper to make it 26-21. On the following possession, Chavez hit another three-pointer, her fourth straight made basket, to push Irvine’s lead up to 29-21.</p>\n<p>From there, the Anteaters were able to hold UCSB at bay. A lay-up by UCSB’s freshman forward Chaya Durr cut the deficit to 45-35 with just under six minutes remaining. Irvine then went on an 11-3 run which included seven makes from the free-throw line as the Anteaters pushed their lead to 56-38, the largest it would be all game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished the game out on a 7-2 run, capped off by a steal and lay-up by junior point guard Dioseline Lopez as time ran out, but their second half efforts were not enough as they fell 58-46.</p>\n<p>Chavez finished her night with a game-high 18 points on 6-12 shooting off the bench. More impressively, she knocked down 5-10 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos’ biggest weakness of late has been their poor rebounding, the difference in last night’s game came from the field. Both teams finished the night with 50 field-goal attempts, but UCSB was able to convert just 30 percent of its shots compared to 44 percent for the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>UCSB was only outrebounded 37-32 on the night, an improvement from their -9.8 rebounding margin coming into the game. The Gauchos turned the ball over 16 times to Irvine’s 19 as both teams finished the night with 19 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ bench shot an impressive 66.7 percent from the field, but only attempted six shots. The starters shot just 25 percent as a unit. Junior guard Jasmine Ware was the only starter for Santa Barbara that finished with an efficient shooting night, going 6-9 from the field for a team-high 12 points.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a road game against UC Davis tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61455\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/ucsb-nearly-out-of-playoff-contention-after-loss-at-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61455\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/ucsb-nearly-out-of-playoff-contention-after-loss-at-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/ucsb-nearly-out-of-playoff-contention-after-loss-at-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/ucsb-nearly-out-of-playoff-contention-after-loss-at-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-27/ucsb-nearly-out-of-playoff-contention-after-loss-at-irvine/","id":405,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[404,403,402],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Suffer 62-60 loss to UTGRV on Game-Winning Layup, Prepare for  Wyoming and Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11.24_StephenManga_WBBall-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11.24_StephenManga_WBBall-4-web.jpg?resize=533%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite a 21-point effort by sophomore shooting guard Makala Roper and a game-tying layup by senior forward Kendra Morrison, the UCSB women's basketball allowed UTRGV to score a game-winning layup for...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A game-tying layup by senior forward Kendra Morrison with seven seconds remaining in regulation knotted the UCSB women’s basketball team with the University of Texas- Rio Grande Valley at 60 apiece.

Protect the rim, make that kid make a pass at least. But we don’t lose it there. We lose it in all those stretches, we just kind of fall asleep and don’t attack. We didn’t rotate and protect the rim, it shouldn’t have never been.”</p>\n<p>Despite allowing an 11-0 run to open the third quarter and trailing 36-45 entering the fourth quarter, Santa Barbara nearly forced overtime in its comeback effort. Twenty-one points off the bench by sophomore shooting guard Makala Roper guided the team’s come-from-behind attempt. Her 21 points were a game-high in Thursday’s contest and were two points shy of her career-high of 23.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Savoy’s late basket handed the Gauchos their second consecutive loss, making them 1-4 overall while it boosted UTRGV’s overall record to 4-2.</p>\n<p>Although junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe and sophomore forward Chaya Durr were added to the team’s starting lineup for Thursday’s matchup, leading UCSB’s 8-1 run to start the game was senior shooting guard Jasmine Ware.</p>\n<p>In just five minutes of play, she scored six points on 3-4 shooting. The Gauchos’ success on offense eventually led to the Vaqueros playing a “one-man” full court press. This caused some problems for UCSB when inbounding the ball but was not the primary challenge in facing Rio Grande Valley.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t a full-court pressure,” Henrickson said. “The inbounder has to just let it go. You’re just letting one guy dictate the flow of the game. We looked better in the second half but we struggled in the first half with it. Not that we turned it over, but we didn’t get much flow and rhythm.”</p>\n<p>UCSB had a season-low 12 turnovers, but even more problematic was the Gauchos’ foul trouble. Freshman forward Kali Jones fouled out in the fourth quarter with 4:09 remaining in the game in addition to a total of five UCSB players had two or more fouls.</p>\n<p>UTRGV capitalized on UCSB’s abundance of fouls, going on a 10-0 run to take an 11-8 lead to end the first quarter. Prior to fouling out, Jones started to establish her presence in the paint in the second quarter. She scored four of her six points in the quarter and finished the game 3-4 from the field.</p>\n<p>Jones’ minimal production in the game helped jumpstart the Gauchos outscoring the Vaqueros 34-18 in the paint as Durr, Roper, Ware and Morrison carried the workload down low while Jones played just 18 minutes.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 37.5 shooting and 14.3 three-point percentages, Santa Barbara’s consistent drive to the paint helped it go into halftime with a three-point lead of 30-27.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB’s foul trouble proved to be costly in the third quarter. Having to send Jones, Ware and Jemerigbe to the bench nearly two minutes into the quarter, the Gauchos’ reserves were fatigued and it was evident as the Vaqueros outscored UCSB 18-6.</p>\n<p>Scoring eight points in UTRGV’s 11-0 run was junior guard Shawnte’ Goff. Despite an off first half in which she had four points all at the free throw line, she finished the game with 15 points on 4-10 shooting, 2-3 from long range and recorded three steals.</p>\n<p>“We had some momentum going into the locker room but came out flat,” Henrickson said. “We made some energy plays but that wasn’t until the last four minutes. It’s not who you play, it’s not where you play but how you play.”</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB’s bench outscored UTRVG’s 37-10, scoring 31 of these points were Roper and Morrison. In the last 3:26 of the quarter, the two scored the team’s last 11 points.</p>\n<p>Roper scored the Gauchos’ first six points of the fourth quarter, cutting the Vaqueros’ lead to five at 42-47. After playing just five minutes in the first half, Morrison went 4-7 from the field and had seven of her 10 points in the fourth quarter. She was also responsible for Santa Barbara’s last five points in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Despite Morrison’s game-tying layup, UCSB did not get back on defense quick enough and was beat by Savoy going coast to coast for the game-winning layup.</p>\n<p>In the 3:40 mark of the third quarter, Durr suffered an undisclosed injury while committing a foul.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road this Friday, Nov. 25<sup>th</sup> at Wyoming at 6:00 p.m. in Arena-Auditorium. Wyoming is 2-1 after its 61-56 overtime victory over Big West counterpart Cal State Fullerton on Thursday. Santa Barbara will continue its road journey against Pepperdine this Sunday, Nov. 29<sup>th</sup> at 1:00 p.m. in Firestone Fieldhouse.
