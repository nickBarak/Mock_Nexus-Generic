CSF Freshman Sahid Valenzuela then followed with a shot to left to score him and Hurst, tying it 4-4.</p>\n<p>Innings four and five were entirely scoreless as well, but the Titans broke the even score wide open in the bottom of the sixth to bring in four more.</p>\n<p>Fullerton senior shortstop Timmy Richards had the go-ahead RBI single to left, plating junior first baseman Dillon Persinger. Then junior catcher Chris Hudgins stepped up with two outs and went deep with a three-run homer to add some insurance.</p>\n<p>This carried the Titans to a victory, as the score remained 8-4 from the last out of the sixth all the way through the ninth after Nelson was relieved by junior RHP Steven Ledesma (1-5, 5.77 ERA), who was then followed by freshman RHP Liam Steigerwald (0-0, 0.00 ERA).</p>\n<p>Ace Noah Davis is returning to UCSB’s rotation, after having been out on injury, for Saturday evening’s game at 7 p.m. which will be aired live on FOX Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos still have the potential to win this series and damage Cal State Fullerton’s chances at locking down a region bid with Cal Poly still just one game behind the Titans in Big West standings, but they will need to find some inspiration at the plate to do so.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77851\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-13/ucsb-drops-8-5-decision-at-fullerton-in-game-one-of-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77851\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-13/ucsb-drops-8-5-decision-at-fullerton-in-game-one-of-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-13/ucsb-drops-8-5-decision-at-fullerton-in-game-one-of-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-13/ucsb-drops-8-5-decision-at-fullerton-in-game-one-of-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-13/ucsb-drops-8-5-decision-at-fullerton-in-game-one-of-series/","id":4255,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[4254,4253,4252],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley","biography":"Not available","articles":[1903,4040,4115,4116,4125,4129,4144,4210,4217,4248,4255,4952,5493],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Rally For 6-3 Victory to Give Checketts 200th Career Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2017-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-06-at-2.57.52-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-06-at-2.57.52-PM.png?resize=967%2C589&ssl=1","description":"Despite falling behind 3-0 in the early going, the UCSB baseball team rallied behind the performance of freshman utility Armani Smith to come out the victor 6-3 in game one of the series.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite falling behind 3-0 after giving up a home run in the third inning, junior left-handed pitcher Kyle Nelson rallied to allow just three hits and no runs over the last six innings to help the UCSB baseball team earn a 6-3 victory at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“He did a great job of bouncing back and being himself,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “His competitive spirit kicked in late in the game and he was able to ride that.”</p>\n<p>The win lifts the Gauchos to 20-22 overall, 6-7 in the Big West.

First, redshirt senior catcher Elijah Ontiveros reached on an error by the left-hander, then Ryan Hooper was hit by Nelson’s pitch putting runners on first and second.</p>\n<p>After a bunt to advance the runners, sophomore Ryan Anderson lit up the scoreboard hitting a home run to left field for his fifth homer of the year to help his team take a 3-0 lead through three full innings.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would respond in the third inning with a four-run rally which began with a single from redshirt senior catcher Dempsey Grover who would eventually score after a sac fly from junior shortstop J.J. Muno.</p>\n<p>With two outs in the bottom of the third inning, Smith came to the plate with a bases loaded situation. The freshman delivered with a three-run double to right field making the score 4-3 in favor of the home team, a lead it would not give up for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added an insurance run in the bottom of the sixth after Muno, reached on a fielder’s choice then stole second after a failed pickoff attempt from the Aggies’ starting pitcher, redshirt junior Orlando Razo. After a throwing error which allowed Muno to take third, sophomore third baseman Tevin Mitchell brought in the junior with a groundout RBI.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final run came in the bottom of the seventh inning after Smith hit a shot past the net in left field for a one-shot home run, the second of his young career, to make the score 6-3 through seven full innings.</p>\n<p>Nelson, despite getting into some trouble in the eighth and the ninth, kept delivering the crucial outs to help his team get the victory. The junior picked up his first complete-game finish of his career and his sixth win of the season after allowing six hits, three runs, two earned, but managing to strike out six batters.</p>\n<p>“He looked tired at the end but I think it was more him being a bit too catious than anything else,” Checketts said. “When we got the lead, he got some quick outs and in the ninth, those three outs, that’s why they pay guys a lot of money to get those final outs.”</p>\n<p>One of the best things about this win was the fact that the Gauchos were able to again rally. This team has shown signs of being a winner all year but has failed to live up to its expectation. Now, maybe this entire team is ready to rally.</p>\n<p>Due to whether inclinations, UCSB and UC Davis will be playing in a double header tomorrow meaning, that the home team, with two wins tomorrow, will not only complete a sweep of a conference opponent but be .500 overall and own a winning Big West record giving them the confidence it needs heading forward.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara faces Davis at 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, May 5th at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Game two of the doubleheader will take place 30 minutes after the conclusion of the first game at the same location.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

but it was changed for the preservation of local wildlife. <em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) Board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/\">discussed plans</a> to open the park in February, according to Jacob Lebell, the Chairman of the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD).</p>\n<p>Construction for the park was expected to begin during spring. However, the construction was delayed until August, Lebell said.</p>\n<p>About 30 members of the I.V. community were in attendance at the grand opening, alongside four IVRPD Board members, including Pegeen Soutar and Matias Eusterbrock. Both worked alongside Lebell during the construction process.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD made several changes to the park in order to made it dog-compatible, including securing the perimeter with fences and altering the landscape to make it a safer space, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>“[The IVRPD] secur[ed] the fence in the back and [ran] a fence in the front with a double gate, as well as a vehicle access gate, and then we took out all of the rubber multrain on the place structure and replaced it with wood chips,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>The board hopes to add several more features to the park, including sprinklers, tables, an additional mutt mitt dispenser, a tunnel bridge, ramps and slides, according to Soutar.</p>\n<p>Soutar said the biggest setback the IVRPD faced in establishing the park was “finding the right park that would work… having enough space and [finding] a neighborhood it wouldn’t be a problem in.”</p>\n<p>The IVRPD initially planned to create the dog park in Anisq’Oyo Park. However, it was found unsuitable due to incompatible aspects of the terrain, according to Soutar.</p>\n<p>With the growing population of dogs in I.V., concerns with the safety of residents has risen, Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD is providing a dog training course that is free and accessible to all residents in I.V. The board is working with Jeike Meijer, Associated Students external vice president of local affairs, to help fund this program.</p>\n<p>The dog training courses will be every Sunday at 11 a.m. at Sueno Park, beginning on Oct. 21. A trainer from “Four on the Floor,” a locally based training company, will teach the dogs a basic set of behaviors.</p>\n<p>The training course’s’ main objective is to “help students afford an opportunity to train their dogs and also have a better relationship with their dog,” Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>In addition to the training courses, the board would like to work with Progressive Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.), a national charitable organization, to offer a mobile health van that provides dogs with medical resources such as vaccinations, spaying and neutering.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the board hopes to “build a community around dogs in I.V.” that helps foster a welcoming environment, Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p><em>Katie Wolf contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84361\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84361\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-15/isla-vistas-bark-park-now-open/","id":4254,"author":{"id":241,"name":"Medlyn Grasheyella"},"related":[4253,4252,4251],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
