Clinic building.</p>\n<p>Participants discussed the use of a $126,000 budget for committees and services outlined in Das William’s Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) to make I.V., currently an unincorporated area, into a CSD. The selected services, which will be aided by a $200,000 pledge by UCSB after the CSD is created, will be sent to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for approval and placed on the 2016 ballot for voters to a decide on an eight percent utility users tax. The services to be sent to LAFCO are the Municipal Advisory Council, the Tenant Mediation Program, the Area Planning Commission, a parking district, police protection services, community facilities, sidewalks, lighting, gutters, trees and graffiti abatement.</p>\n<p>George Thurlow, Alumni Affairs Office assistant vice chancellor, said although the pledged funds will not be available until after the CSD is created, it should still be included in the report to LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“My suggestion would be that you come up with a wish list for two years, 2017 and 2018, a $200,000 budget for each one and decide which projects and programs you want to fund,” Thurlow said. “Put that in front of LAFCO because they’re going to be criticizing [that] it’s not enough money or good enough services.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, field representative for Williams’ office and UC Santa Barbara alumnus, said the term “police protection services” should be defined before deciding on an alternative community policing program that would cost $75,000.</p>\n<p>“To me, it could be contracting law enforcement to host a few self-defense classes every quarter,” Schunk said. “That to me is contracting for additional law enforcement services and that activates that power just fine, and we also have a contract.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said contracting more law enforcement officers from Santa Barbara County or UC Police Department (UCPD) would “tie” the CSD to the police collaborative board.</p>\n<p>“I just wonder whether or not contracting with them is getting actual on-the-job police services or contracting something small like liaison work,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Pargin, second-year math major, said it would be more beneficial to get additional police services from UCPD because it would come out of the university’s budget instead of the CSD’s budget.</p>\n<p>The collaborative program is based on the S.N.A.P. program at Cal Poly which hires students to be first responders and provide campus warnings. Since the university does not want to expand the CSO program into I.V., the contracting cadets would not be UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliot, community organizer from Das Williams’ office, said the CSD could replicate S.N.A.P., but will not be an extension of the program.</p>\n<p>“They could work with student groups with whatever project they’re working on,” Elliot said. “These cadets do not carry weapons and are in training to eventually become officers. It would be better because they would learn to respond without weapons and have training that didn’t incorporate immediate arresting.”</p>\n<p>Jonathon Abboud, Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus, said it would be best to fund as many services as possible through LAFCO’s approval and distribute $200,000 in UCSB pledge funds afterwards.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually better and more effective in the long term with the money we have instead of spreading the budget out way too thin where you couldn’t do that much per year,” Abboud said. “I think it’s a much more prudent approach to LAFCO where you’ve already thought of eight percent.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67671\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67671\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/stakeholders-discuss-finances-budget/","id":4581,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[4580,4579,4578],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick","biography":"Not available","articles":[2552,4570,4572,4579,4581],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

The UUT would provide $512,000 for services in I.V., ranging from administrative positions to a parking plan.</p>\n<p>The CSD administration is expected to receive an estimated $257,000 from the budget. This will include an IVCSD general manager to oversee public engagements and contracts for services, as well as the implantation of programs decided by the board of directors.</p>\n<p>Lanny Ebenstein, UCSB professor of economics, said he was unsure if the general manager would be a part-time position.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if there is going to be basically one full-time person, because the clerical is part-time and the transaction is part-time, and the recourse development person is part-time,” Ebenstein said.</p>\n<p>The general manager would have a salary of $162,500 and a part time clerical staff would receive compensation of $31,250 and other office expenses.</p>\n<p>Ebenstein said the salary of the general manager would be too costly for the budget.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure if that is the amount required to get someone to fill the responsibilities of the general manager of IVCSD,” Ebenstein said. “I think that is something that merits further consideration … there might be other comparable positions in I.V. I think the figure is too high given the budget.”</p>\n<p>LuAnn Miller, the Executive Director of Isla Vista Youth Projects, said an eight percent tax could be a concern for voters, especially with the addition of a new administrative position.</p>\n<p>“I wonder about any intentional kickback from voters who are going to be looking at this and say, ‘You’re asking us to add this utility tax and part of it would go to administration. I won’t be voting on that,’” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Ken Masuda, a volunteer with Assemblymember Das Williams’s office, said the $30,000 allotted for improved I.V. parking will benefit current and future residents because it will present a new plan based on the size of groups of individuals who park in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think the parking study we want is going to be a little different in the sense that when we were discussing parking, we made a list of groups we wanted to have parking and a list of groups we want to discourage from parking,” Masuda said. “But we don’t know anything about the size of any of those groups.”</p>\n<p>According to Masuda, understanding the sizes of the different groups of people who park in I.V. would be useful for the Community Service District (CSD) in planning better parking.</p>\n<p>“One thing [that] would be helpful for the CSD-sponsored parking study is to try to get at what are the sizes of those different groups,” Masuda said. “And so in that way, the cost of the study could be more when you’re trying to get that level of detail.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, field representative for Assemblymember Das Williams’ office, said visual changes in the community would show taxpayer money directly at work.</p>\n<p>“Sidewalks, lighting, and trees are some of the most immediately visual impacting things you see in a community, and it may serve the CSD well to be able to do small projects that have striking visual impact,” Schunk said. “That way, people associate that with the work the district is doing.”</p>\n<p>The other services in the budget amounted to $204,000. The Community Service District (CSD) would support tenant mediation as well as community Facility Recourse Development, which includes community health and economic development programs.</p>\n<p>The proposal must be finalized within a month to be presented to the LAFCO. After an application has been accepted, a hearing will be scheduled within 90 days.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67887\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-budget-potential-ivcsd-general-manager/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67887\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-budget-potential-ivcsd-general-manager/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-budget-potential-ivcsd-general-manager/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-budget-potential-ivcsd-general-manager/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/i-v-stakeholders-discuss-budget-potential-ivcsd-general-manager/","id":4578,"author":{"id":250,"name":"Amanda Wright"},"related":[4577,4576,4575],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic building to discuss potential forms of tenant mediation in I.V. if it becomes a Community Services District (CSD) in the November 2016 county election.</p>\n<p>The group met with Andrea Bifano, representative of the Community Development Department Rental Housing Mediation of Santa Barbara County, to discuss further plans for mediation. UCSB students, who have access to mediation through the University, are currently the only I.V. residents with such services.</p>\n<p>According to Jay Freeman, who is running for Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor, stakeholders should consider the fact that UCSB students already have free mediation at their disposal.</p>\n<p>“Some of the tax money people are paying is to go towards this service that they are also getting from somewhere else,” Freeman said. “I don’t think we should fully discount them. The board will make a decision on who they want to serve. UCSB is not running this government.”</p>\n<p>Carlos Lopez, fourth-year anthropology major and A.S. Lobby Corps director, said he is interested in a new mediation program that would educate renters on how to communicate with landlords about property maintenance.</p>\n<p>“I think the ability to inform students on what their rights are when living in a house is good,” Lopez said. “There have been only a few situations when something might be going on in your house and you’re not sure if it’s your job or your landlord’s job to fix. For a lot of students who are only going to be living there for a year, it’s kind of easier to put up with it for a year.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said it is important for renters to uphold open communication with their landlords about what to do if a property needs maintenance.</p>\n<p>“Even in my house there was something wrong with our fence and one of our neighbors was talking about how when they called the landlord they got a way different response than when they went online to deal with the problem,” Lopez said. “So it’s good to establish some level of consistency in treatment on issues for tenants and the things that happen.”</p>\n<p>Audrey Tamayo, a member of the Isla Vista Tenants Union and third-year political science major, said the University mediation program does not always take into account the point of view of everyone in tenant-landlord mediations.</p>\n<p>“From my accounts with people that I know, the University’s program has not been as effective as they should,” Tamayo said. “Some of the problems include mediators twisting the words a bit, so in one instance where my friend and her roommate were having an argument and one of the tenants had pushed her up against the balcony, the mediator rephrased it as a push-shove fight. That implies a mutual kind of pushing and shoving, [but] it was only one tenant who was pushing.”</p>\n<p>According to Tamayo, many tenants, including her own housemates, fear going to the University for help with mediation because they believe it will end in a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>“I guess they are kind of scared in a way, since others are always saying that they’re going to sue you if you go do this,” Tamayo said.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, Santa Barbara City College trustee and UCSB alumnus, said he appreciates that the program will provide safety for many tenants who oftentimes end up experiencing difficulty with legality.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate hearing the fact that it ultimately can result in a legally binding contract or document,” Abboud said. “A lot of the times, dealing with landlords and property managers, you might come up with a spoken agreement, but when it comes time to resolve it, there’s another thing that ends up happening.”</p>\n<p>The task force of mediators would be neutral between tenants and landlords, with discussions of creating workshops where all parties could come together to receive education on renting in I.V. The proposed tenant mediation would be incorporated into the eight percent Utility User’s Tax, which will be on the November 2016 ballot.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68049\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/i-v-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-potential-tenant-mediation-programs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68049\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/i-v-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-potential-tenant-mediation-programs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/i-v-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-potential-tenant-mediation-programs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/i-v-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-potential-tenant-mediation-programs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/i-v-stakeholders-meet-to-discuss-potential-tenant-mediation-programs/","id":4579,"author":{"id":131,"name":"Amanda Quick"},"related":[4578,4577,4576],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Giovanni’s Pizzeria To Reopen","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gios-Closing_by-Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Giovanni’s Pizzeria, which closed last Thursday to the dismay of many Isla Vista residents, will be reopening tomorrow under new management by Gio’s franchise owners Danny and Debra Babai.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Giovanni’s Pizzeria, which closed last Thursday to the dismay of many Isla Vista residents, will be reopening tomorrow under new management by Gio’s franchise owners Danny and Debra Babai.</p>\n<p>According to the Babais, Gio’s closed temporarily to allow the new owners to transfer business and alcohol permits back to the location from previous owner Matt Metzka. The Babais have been doing restoration work inside the restaurant and will be opening the restaurant tomorrow at 11 p.m. as “Founders Family” Giovanni’s Pizza Isla Vista, with a grand opening from January 29 to 31.</p>\n<p>Debra Babai said the staff will remain the same as it was before the temporary closing, but the new managers will be Indres Govender and Carrie Leonard. Danny Babai said the ownership change was due to confidential reasons.</p>\n<p>“We took it back from the franchisee — it was confidential but we had to get it back,” Danny Babai said. “We hired back all the people who used to work here.”</p>\n<p>Founder’s Family Giovanni’s Pizza has operated in the Santa Barbara area since 1979. According to a statement from the Babais, Danny Babai opened the first Founder’s Family Giovanni’s Pizza on State Street in 1979 and continues overseeing the business. Garrett Gruendyke, one of Danny’s sons, has owned and run an additional location, Giovanni’s Pizza on the Mesa, since 2009.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67600\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/giovannis-pizzeria-to-reopen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67600\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/giovannis-pizzeria-to-reopen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/giovannis-pizzeria-to-reopen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/giovannis-pizzeria-to-reopen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/giovannis-pizzeria-to-reopen/","id":4580,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4579,4578,4577],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
