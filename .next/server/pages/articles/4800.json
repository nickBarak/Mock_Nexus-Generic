The meeting was hosted by Santa Barbara Assemblymember Das Williams, who on Monday introduced a bill to the California State Assembly seeking to establish I.V. as a CSD through the legislature, rather than through Santa Barbara’s Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), the county entity responsible for overseeing changes to county and municipal governments.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, an elected body governing I.V. as an incorporated city could potentially alienate long-term residents who are not students.</p>\n<p>“If I could wave a magic wand, I would be for Isla Vista becoming a full-fledged municipal government with the powers and resources of a full-fledged municipal government,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>“However, I think the flaws of it is that the question of how long-term residents would effectively continue to have a political voice in a demographic where the population became a larger population of students over the years, that was never really effectively answered.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he does not currently support cityhood for I.V. because it would not be possible to provide the variety of I.V. residents with appropriate political representation.</p>\n<p>“I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not possible politically because of that basic question of, how do you balance representation to represent all of the Isla Vista community?” Williams said. “How do you represent the 7,000 … people who live here longer than four years at a time when the vast majority live here for a shorter duration?”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59083\" style=\"width: 431px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59083\" data-attachment-id=\"59083\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/iv-self-governance-forum/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IV-Self-Governance-forum-by-Alex-Nagase_for-12.04.2014-1-of-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1100&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1100\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Assemblyman Das Williams speaks in the Isla Vista self-governance forum.

You can do almost everything except land use policy.”</p>\n<p>Another potential policy that was discussed at the meeting was the implementation of a UUT — a form of tax levied on the consumption of utilities services, such as water, telephone and gas — specifically to raise revenues to fund additional services for I.V.</p>\n<p>According to Jay Freeman, an alumnus and local business owner, a utilities tax could provide the funds for better services for I.V. residents to the tune of roughly three million dollars.<br>\nFreeman said he suggests further research be conducted as to the effects a UUT would have on I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“That kind of balances the books with what we would be trying to do with a city,” Freeman said. “I’m really interested in the idea of maybe trying to construct a new financial study that instead of just looking at what we have looks at what we have combined with what we do.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr was skeptical about the logistics of implementing taxes in I.V. if it remains unincorporated as a CSD.</p>\n<p>“It’s difficult to carve out one part of the unincorporated area for something to apply to,” Farr said. “The Board of Supervisors could look at trying to put a UUT on the ballot but it would have to apply to county-wide in all of the unincorporated areas.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy said the student body is not satisfied with the status quo regarding I.V. and would support the establishment of a stronger form of local government.</p>\n<p>“I think students are really on board with this movement,” Guthy said. “We’ve been having these conversations in summer and I think there were questions before about do we like the status quo? In the conversations I’ve just been having, speaking from a student perspective, is ‘No.’”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, students feel the current level of safety in I.V. is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p>“Students feel unsafe walking just to their homes at night, you know, just walking from the library and that sense of insecurity in our own community is problematic,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>No decisions about the most suitable form of self-government were made at the meeting. However, it was stated that more roundtable meetings and public forums will be held at times and locations yet to be determined.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59080\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59080\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/community-meets-for-latest-on-i-v-self-governance/","id":4800,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4799,4798,4797],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.: A History — Part II","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Although Isla Vista tried and failed for cityhood in 1973, the I.V.

Community Council (IVCC) made several other attempts to give I.V. a more sustainable form of government in the years following.</p>\n<p><strong>1972: I.V. Creates Community Services District (CSD)</strong></p>\n<p>Other options for self-governance for I.V. also included the 1972 passage of a bill by the California legislature establishing the I.V. College Community Services District (IVCCSD). This action created a community services district (CSD), a small form of independent government that allows a given unincorporated area to tax itself to provide certain services to itself that cannot otherwise be provided by a county government.</p>\n<p>According to alumnus Josh Plotke, who acted as a research assistant to the recently released UCSB Foundation Trustees’ Advisory Committee on Isla Vista Strategies, I.V. residents pushed for a CSD in hopes of working up to later establishing a city.</p>\n<p>“They tried to create a city without calling it a city,” Plotke said. “They tried to create a law with a CSD with more extended powers than CSD law allowed.”</p>\n<p>Plotke also said the university was opposed to being included in the IVCCSD, which contributed to its ultimate failure.</p>\n<p>“The reason why it failed was the county said they [the CSD] had to include UCSB,” Plotke said. “UCSB at first acted neutral and then hired a publicist and spent $100,000 for a publicist to fight against this thing.”</p>\n<p>In 1972, Plotke said the California state legislature passed a law outlining I.V. as a special legislative district, — or a government created by the legislature to oversee a specific area — which initiated the I.V. Municipal Advisory Council (IVMAC). A municipal advisory council is a body of elected or appointed officials that convene to assess the needs of a given city or county government and recommend specific action. While a CSD can govern by controlling specific services provided to an area, a MAC serves a purely advisory role and has no actual power to provide services.</p>\n<p>Despite the formation of the CSD on paper, the IVCCSD was never implemented as it also required the approval of the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for Santa Barbara County, an independent state-mandated entity responsible for overseeing the establishment of local governments, which rejected the proposal.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58943\" style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-II-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1694545327\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58941\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58943\" data-attachment-id=\"58943\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/i-v-a-history-part-ii/iv-self-governance-feature-ii-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-II-2.jpg?fit=1200%2C647&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,647\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D3&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;IVCC members seemed to be enjoying themselves at last Monday night's meeting.

The plan would incorporate all three areas as portions of the city of Santa Barbara and greatly expand its municipal borders. The university came out in support of the annexation plan, with then-chancellor Vernon Cheadle stating it would provide “the lowest long term tax rates for the greatest number of citizens.”</p>\n<p>The annexation plan was put to an election in March of 1975 that required a majority of voters in both the Goleta Valley area and the City of Santa Barbara to approve the plan. Despite university support for the measure, overwhelming majorities of both I.V. and Santa Barbara residents voted against it and the measure failed.</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident Carmen Lodise’s book <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em>, after I.V.’s failure of annexation to Santa Barbara, the IVCC called for a new advisory election, or plebiscite, to determine the best option for a local government for I.V. Options presented were incorporation of I.V. into a city, incorporation of I.V. with Goleta or maintenance of the status quo. The election, held on May 27, 1975, resulted in an overwhelming majority of support for the independent incorporation of I.V as a city, which at the time had its proposed boundaries include Storke Road, Hollister Avenue and the Venoco Corporation’s Platform Holly oil rig.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em>, the UC Board of Regents was split in its opinion on cityhood for I.V., with at least five regents supporting the proposal. The university, Lodise writes, was opposed to cityhood.</p>\n<p>Following the results of the May, 1975 plebiscite, IVCC made another submission for independent cityhood to LAFCO in 1975 backed with support from the university, which LAFCO rejected again in February of 1976 on a 4-1 vote, citing concerns over the financial feasibility of an incorporated I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons Behind Failure of I.V. Cityhood</strong></p>\n<p>Lodise said he blames the political motivations of the LAFCO members for not approving I.V. cityhood, as the four no votes all came from Republicans on LAFCO, while the only yes came from a Democrat.</p>\n<p>“The wrap was that I.V. was not financially feasible,” Lodise said. “In reality, it was Republicans [on LAFCO] defeating the town because [I.V.] was overwhelmingly Democratic.”</p>\n<p>Plotke said LAFCO could not approve those proposals because various fiscal analyses have found I.V. cityhood to be unrealistic.</p>\n<p>“I.V. is a big financial drain. It’s a small tax space with a dense population that means increased expenses,” Plotke said. “It would be illegal for LAFCO to approve a city.”</p>\n<p>Lodise’s <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em> stated that concerns over financial feasibility of I.V. as a city were misguided but important for the Republicans on LAFCO. Lodise wrote that LAFCO was commonly thought to produce numbers on the expenditures a proposed city would make, when in practice such figures are typically determined by the city’s first city council.</p>\n<p>Lodise also stated LAFCO had no authority to use financial feasibility as a criteria in determining the viability of incorporation for a given area.</p>\n<p><strong>I.V. Self-Governance Burns Out</strong></p>\n<p>For the next few years the only governmental entities existing in I.V. were those related to IVCC and the I.V. Parks and Recreation District (IVRPD). The IVRPD oversaw the growth of new parks in I.V. beginning in 1975, adding 14 new parks to a list that originally included Anisq’Oyo Park on Embarcadero Del Mar, “Dogshit” Park along Del Playa Drive and Children’s Park on Picasso Rd.</p>\n<p>Despite this growth, little in the way of additional self-governance campaigns materialized in the years between 1975 and 1982.</p>\n<p>According to Lodise’s <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History,</em> years of tension between the residents of I.V. and Goleta over representation on the Goleta Water Board, which provided water services to both unincorporated areas, contributed to renewed fervor for cityhood for I.V.</p>\n<p>The 1982 IVCC election saw a slate of candidates elected who supported independent cityhood for I.V. and opposed an incorporation plan that included Goleta, which was supported by IVCC executive director John Buttny, who promptly resigned after the election. Also in 1982, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors refused to contribute its portion of funds to the IVCC, a loss of about $10,000. Shortly thereafter, the university, also a key provider of funds to IVCC, also discontinued its funding of the council, an amount of about $9,000, according to Lodise. Funding for the council by the Board of Regents also ended entirely in 1982 after a steady decline from its peak in 1971.</p>\n<p>Despite the funding cuts, the IVCC pressed on with a cityhood proposal, filing it with LAFCO in 1984 which was again rejected in a 4-1 vote. The council lasted for several more years, but without funding went defunct in 1987.</p>\n<p>According to Plotke, after the IVCC and IVMAC lost funding, prompting residents to push for a CSD to try and recover some form of self-governance for the I.V. However, he said, proponents realized that funding for a CSD could not be started until long after the IVCC and IVMAC disappeared, which effectively ended the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“They found that there was going to be a gap in funding from the time the funding [for IVCC and IVMAC] was cut off to a time a CSD could be established,” Plotke said.</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident, local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman, self-governance talks went on hiatus for over a decade after the defeat of IVCC and IVMAC. He said the group of activists who had helped initiate all the prior movements had lost energy.</p>\n<p>“I think they burned out,” Freeman said. “When they burned out, there was no one there to make this happen in the same way that they did.”</p>\n<p>Self-governance options for I.V. did not become a prominent part of local politics again for over another decade, when Goleta moved to incorporate in 2001.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CHECK OUT THE <em>DAILY NEXUS</em> WEBSITE TOMORROW FOR PART THREE OF THE SERIES: 2000s — present</strong></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to LAFCO as a state controlled agency.

self-governance. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students, faculty and Isla Vista residents met at the Isla Vista Clinic on Embarcadero del Mar yesterday to discuss the history of I.V. as well as problems facing the I.V. self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>The event was co-organized by volunteer group Isla Vista Collective, I.V. Coalition and individual residents, students and academic staff. I.V. Coalition member and comparative literature graduate student Shari Sanders led the meeting, inviting participants to list “trials and triumphs” in I.V. history, including the creation of the I.V. Food Co-op, the I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD), I.V. Elementary School and the maintenance of I.V.’s many parks. Other points of I.V history discussed included episodes of violence, sexual assault and what some alleged as the increasing presence gentrification in I.V.</p>\n<p>Last year, Chancellor Henry T. Yang established the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on I.V. in order to increase the university’s presence in the campus’s neighboring college town.</p>\n<p>According to physics professor Harry Nelson, who is also a member of the Chancellor’s Coordinating Committee on I.V., there could be problems facing the university if administration tries to intervene in the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“Spending money from the University of California, not just UCSB, but the entire University of California on a thing like Isla Vista is a very hard thing to do it turns out, at least with public money,” Nelson said. “Every time you think you have an idea, there’s a vetting process, and a consideration, until someone says, ‘You know, local government is the responsibility of something else in California’s organization, not universities.’”</p>\n<p>As a public university, UCSB faces regulatory and monetary issues that differentiate it from schools with different funding models, Nelson said.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is not a private institution. If we were Stanford it would be totally different,” Nelson said. “There’s totally fewer regulations and requirements. UCSB being public, we have a lot of extra responsibilities with public money.”</p>\n<p>Nelson also said there are a great deal of alumni who feel passionately about I.V. and could potentially contribute to improving it.</p>\n<p>“One thing that’s interesting about Isla Vista is that over the past 50 years, maybe 4,000 students have come through each year,” Nelson said. “You do the math, that’s 200,000 people out there, predominantly in California, who universally love Isla Vista. That’s a very interesting phenomenon that’s never been tapped into.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Constance Brown said she is concerned with the ever-growing population of youth in I.V., a trend that she said she has seen over the past several decades.</p>\n<p>“It’s an undercurrent that, if not corrected, I simply have no hope for I.V. And that is, we used to have some hundreds of mature adults living in single-family homes,” Brown said. “And they used to be maybe professionals, two people, families, but they were stable adults.”</p>\n<p>According to Brown, an older demographic of I.V. residents would balance out the “craziness” caused by the large population of youth in I.V., a phenomenon she alleges has steered I.V. “out of control.”</p>\n<p>“They’re [older residents] virtually gone. There are a handful of us left. But all of those family homes that were a buffer, that created stability, they’re all filled with young people,” Brown said. “You see really nothing but young people out there, and they’re crammed in. Once Isla Vista is wall-to-wall young people, I don’t see any hope for Isla Vista. You cannot contain that amount of young people, all they see is other young people. It’s like Lord of the Flies.”</p>\n<p>In addition, fourth-year global studies major and IVRPD Board of Directors member Jacob Lebell said parking congestion might create a climate detrimental to residents if I.V.’s population continues to increase.</p>\n<p>“I think what kind of gives people permission to act without rules in many ways is that with parking impacted how it is, a lot of I.V. has the feeling of a parking lot and I think that sets kind of the mindset and the environment that a lot of people are acting in,” Lebell said. “It’s a place to kind of put things. That isn’t community space.”</p>\n<p>The meeting was part of an ongoing conversation regarding the I.V. self-governance movement that began <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/\">last Spring</a>. Future meetings will continue to be held the third Thursday of every month in the I.V.

The bill was authored by Williams, who grew up in I.V., an unincorporated area with 20,000 residents situated on less than one square mile.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill would be building off previously passed legislation that established I.V. as a CSD over 30 years ago and would provide more specificity as to the structure and operation of I.V. as a CSD.</p>\n<p>“We would have to spell it out more than that previous legislation did,” Williams said. “I think that it is in the interests of the people of Isla Vista … as well as the state of California … that provides balance.”</p>\n<p>In 1972, when the legislature authorized the establishment of the Isla Vista College Community Services District (IVCCSD), the resulting proposal establishing I.V. as a CSD went before the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which did not approve the authorization.</p>\n<p>Williams said having the legislature act to establish a CSD would provide more flexibility than the LAFCO process.</p>\n<p>“State legislation, unlike the LAFCO process, provides great latitude in spelling out the specific powers of the community services district,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said that if the bill passes, and is approved by the Senate and Governor Jerry Brown, a CSD could be established in I.V. with minimal input from LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“We could include some participation from LAFCO in the process,” Williams said. “However LAFCO is bound to only … approve or disprove a five member board that are all directly elected.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams’ office, the CSD would have the power to facilitate infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security and roads. The bill, however, does not specify how these community services will be funded, although Williams’ office has stated CSDs are commonly funded by revenue bonds or special taxes.</p>\n<p>Williams said the specifics of the CSD’s revenue will be determined through continued community dialogue.</p>\n<p>“There are many ideas for revenue, some are less controversial than others, and that is why we really need a stakeholder process to really talk about what is the right revenue sources for a community services district,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said he thinks a CSD will be more successful than previous attempts at self-governance.</p>\n<p>“We as a community can make that change but we shouldn’t be so naive as to think that we can do it . . . with what we have because what we have had before is not working,” Williams said. “When we had a municipal advisory committee before it did not work. Governance by the county alone, without the resources to do things particularly for I.V., has not worked.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the university supporting the creation of self-governance in I.V. is a positive sign and a key difference to note when comparing previous attempts at self-governance for I.V.</p>\n<p>“One thing that is really important that has changed since the previous attempts at local governance in I.V. is that the university, which was once an impediment to local governance in Isla Vista., is as an institution now arguing for local governance,” Williams said. “That is a change that everyone should have some hope in and it means that the aspirations of Isla Vista as a community may be able to be reached.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the establishment of some form of local governance must address the needs of the variety of residents in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Any local governance should provide a balance between the different residents of Isla Vista.,” Williams said. “Both what you could call the lower income ethnic communities of Isla Vista, the student population and the resident population concentrated out of the west end — there needs to be a balance between the interests of all of those parties.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, he and his staff will be asking for public comments from I.V. residents over the next two months to determine the specifics of the bill and said it is his “intention to continue the community dialogue that has already been taking place.”</p>\n<p>“We will be asking for input as to what powers will be included in this community services district and how many seats there are, what their terms are, that sort of thing,” Williams said. “The legislation … would continue how it is with the added detail that can only happen after we receive more comprehensive and more specific public comment.”</p>\n<p>Williams said that given the events that have occurred in I.V. in the last year, the time to act is now.</p>\n<p>“There is plenty of time for further public input and for the stakeholder process,” Williams said. “But that given, the amount of human pain that has been experienced in Isla Vista in the last year, I felt that action was necessary and that we needed to begin this process and begin it now.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58946\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58946\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/","id":4799,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[4798,4797,4796],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
