All water activities such as swimming and surfing and are highly discouraged.</p>\n<p>Eight beaches in Santa Barbara County were closed. Bacteria levels are lower than they were when tested last week and six more beaches have been opened, including Sands Beach at Coal Oil Point. Goleta, Carpinteria and Hope Ranch beaches remain closed.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Public Health Department is unsure of how much untreated sewage and chemical contamination is in the water because of the devastating effects of the Thomas Fire and significant amounts of rain, according to a press release on Wednesday. The agency is urging the public to avoid contact with any sand or water that looks or smells unusual.</p>\n<p>In an “abundance of caution” and to help with recovery, the department is also urging the public to stay out of the 400-foot buffer zone on each side of the beach where sediment from the mudflows is being deposited . The buffer zone is clearly marked with orange fencing.</p>\n<p>Ocean water will continue to be tested for microbial contaminants until the beaches are determined to be safe. While there has been significant improvement since last week, it is still unclear when the beaches will be reopened.</p>\n<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, coliforms are bacteria generally not considered harmful towards humans. However, increased amounts of coliforms can be indicators of other bacteria, viruses and parasites generally known as pathogens that can cause illness.</p>\n<p>Susan Klein-Rothschild, deputy director of the Santa Barbara Public Health Department, said that this bacteria is generally filtered out through the soil, but that their presence in the water could indicate the presence of sewage waste or feces.</p>\n<p>Beaches in Goleta, Carpinteria and Hammond had more than double the state health standard of coliform, with the rest of the beaches coming in under the standard.</p>\n<p>According to Klein-Rothschild, the amount of coliform was too high to be counted, which was a cause for “serious concern.”</p>\n<p>According to the Center for Disease Control, enterococci are generally found in the bowel and can be collected from water and vegetation generally as a result of contamination from untreated sewage.</p>\n<p>While the standard for enterococcus contamination is 104 MPN, water tests at Goleta Beach show over 24,000 MPN. This is more than 200 times the acceptable limits. In Carpinteria, enterococcus is lower, but still 10 times the acceptable limit.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t go in that water, and I wouldn’t want anyone I care about to go in that water either,” Klein-Rothschild said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

The fire is currently 86 percent contained.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire surpassed the Cedar Fire that burned in San Diego County in October 2003. The Cedar Fire burned 273,246 acres, caused 15 deaths and destroyed 2,820 structures.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire is approximately 16 miles from UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The fire line from Ventura to Santa Barbara is “contained and secure” and fire officials do not expect the fire to progress further since wind speeds have slowed, according to a Cal Fire press release on Sunday.</p>\n<p>All mandatory and voluntary evacuations have been lifted in Santa Barbara County, with the exception of a voluntary evacuation warning on Highway 33 between Rose Valley north to Hartman Ranch.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire has caused the death of one firefighter and one civilian and has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged another 280.</p>\n<p>The blaze began on Dec. 4 and its cause is still under investigation, according to Cal Fire’s incident tracker.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vista residents experienced <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/i-v-residents-out-of-power-for-three-hours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blackouts</a> the night the fire began and responded by flooding the streets of I.V., <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/watch-fireworks-and-couch-burnings-from-the-i-v-power-outage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">setting off fireworks and burning couches</a>.</p>\n<p>Air quality in Santa Barbara and Goleta improved to “good” after weeks of the “unhealthy” air quality that prompted Chancellor Henry T.

The university closed the shelter on Friday, Dec. 22.</p>\n<p>Isla Vistans also stepped up during this tumultuous time. The I.V. Food Cooperative provided a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-20/isla-vista-food-co-op-aids-victims-of-thomas-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">food donation bin</a> for those affected, raising over $1,000 in donations and offering a 15 percent discount for evacuees.</p>\n<p>Firefighters will continue to patrol the fire’s perimeter and use aircraft to drop water on steep areas with limited access. According to Cal Fire, firefighters intend to remain on standby in case new fires erupt as they work to suppress the Thomas Fire.</p>\n<p><em>Updated Dec. 25 at 10:34 p.m. </em></p><div

County, over 1,000 community members gathered Sunday evening at the Santa Barbara Courthouse to mourn the lives lost in last week’s mudslides in Montecito.</p>\n<p>Attendees held L.E.D. lights and candles that shone brightly as the sun began to set over the courthouse. As the names and ages of those who died in the mudslides were read aloud, community members quietly shed tears with the pain of losing a friend, neighbor or family member.</p>\n<p>At least 20 people lost their life in the mudslides that occurred early Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Benitez: 10 years old<br>\nKailly Benitez: 3 years old<br>\nJoseph Francis Bleckel: 87 years old<br>\nMartin Cabrera-Munoz: 48 years old<br>\nDavid Cantin: 49 years old<br>\nMorgan Corey: 25 years old<br>\nSawyer Corey: 12 years old<br>\nPeter Fleurat: 73 years old<br>\nJosephine Gower: 69 years old<br>\nJohn McManigal: 61 years old<br>\nAlice Mitchell: 78 years old<br>\nJames Mitchell: 89 years old<br>\nCaroline Montgomery: 22 years old<br>\nMark Montgomery: 54 years old<br>\nMarilyn Ramos: 27 years old<br>\nRebecca Riskin: 61 years old<br>\nRoy Rohter: 84 years old<br>\nPinit Sutthithepa: 30 years old<br>\nPeerawat Sutthithepa: 6 years old<br>\nRichard Loring Taylor: 79 years old</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80384\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/vigil-at-sunken-gardens-3-2/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80384\" data-attachment-id=\"80384\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/vigil-at-sunken-gardens-3-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1251&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1251\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Vigil at Sunken Gardens-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?fit=250%2C153&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?fit=888%2C543&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80384\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=888%2C542\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"542\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=250%2C153&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C626&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80384\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Local elected and community leaders organized the event and offered words of hope to attendees, many of whom knew people who were lost in the mudslides. <em>Courtesy photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Local elected and community leaders organized the vigil, including First District Supervisor Das Williams, County Board of Supervisors Chair Joan Hartmann, State Senator Hannah Beth Jackson and Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>Members of the Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist faiths also came to support the community in its grief.

The boxes will replace the bus sticker system for UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby said a new smartphone app will launch later this year to give real-time GPS tracking of buses en route. This service will also be available via text for non-smartphone users. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lines 24x, which runs from UCSB to downtown Santa Barbara, and 12x, which runs from Hollister to downtown Santa Barbara, will decrease in frequency, running every 35 minutes instead of the current 30 minutes. Some routes or bus times will be removed entirely, although MTD has yet to determine which ones.</span></p>\n<p>Stops along Lines 6, 11, 20, 21x 23, and 25 will also be adjusted in their times, but frequency of stops will remain the same. A minor reroute will be made for Line 23 after 7 p.m. to accommodate the El Encanto Heights neighborhood.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB and SBCC student line, 15x, will see a frequency increase of up to six minutes. An additional six trips in both directions will be added during “key parts of the day,” said transit planner Mark Clyde. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lines 1 and 2 will revert morning weekday commute hour services from 10 minute to 15 minute frequencies due to the loss of a grant source.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a potential new route will run two trips during the morning and evening commute hours between Goleta and Carpinteria, which will be funded by Caltrans.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although ridership has decreased and one grant was lost for Lines 1 and 2, MTD officials said the bus schedule changes are only due to traffic congestion and not in response to decreasing ridership and funding loss, as the </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first reported.</span></em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported that stops along Lines 6, 11, 20, 21x 23 and 25 will also be reduced in frequency.
