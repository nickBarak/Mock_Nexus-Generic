Tate holds the second most number of strikeouts and second best ERA in the conference.</p>\n<p>“It’s not the end of the world, but sometimes [losses] happen. I know the guys have my back,” Tate said. “I just need to keep doing what I’m doing, and I know they’ll back me up.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho pitching staff is up against a very hot and cold Fresno offense that is coming off a losing series against New Mexico, where it scored eight runs on Saturday and only one on Sunday. Before that, Fresno went on a five-game win streak against UCSB, San Jose and No. 21 Cal, where its lineup scored a total of 42 runs. The Bulldogs have scored at least six runs in their past seven outings.</p>\n<p>“I feel good about our starters. We need to get our bullpen guys in there, they didn’t get much work last weekend,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be high scoring or not, but I feel comfortable with our starters, but we need to work on minimizing their pitch count.”</p>\n<p>In a commanding spot of the Fresno lineup is junior catcher Taylor Ward who has accounted for 25 RBI this season. Ward currently holds a team high .359 batting average and a .485 on base percentage.</p>\n<p>“I think [the team is] going to be ready to go, and we learned a lot over this past weekend,” Checketts said. “We pitched great but we didn’t play great offense, but I think we’ll come in more prepared for this series than they were last weekend.”</p>\n<p>Though the Gaucho offense struggled for consistency in the previous Long Beach State series, UCSB still accounts for multiple offensive conference leaders. Nesovic tops the conference chart with 24 RBI this season and comes in at third for season batting average, as he hits for .372.</p>\n<p>“We need to be able to handle different types of pitchers,” Checketts said. “We’re going to try to give them some different looks in batting practice, and adjust based on style of pitching.”</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Cameron Newell comes in behind Nesovic for fifth in the conference with .347. On the base path, Leadoff hitter, redshirt sophomore Andrew Calica has had 10 stolen bases, the third most in Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB is also tied in the conference with UC Davis for overall team batting average with .298. Though UCSB falls slightly behind Davis in overall on-base percentage, the Gauchos lead the league in RBIs with 141 this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to have an away approach and focus on hitting the ball to the opposite side of the field,” Nesovic said. “I think we’ll do that fine this week.”</p>\n<p>The series against Fresno State will run from today through Saturday at home. This will be the last home series for the Gauchos until they return to Santa Barbara to face rival Cal Poly after a road-trip to play Cal State Northridge next weekend.</p>\n<p>Today’s game is scheduled for 3 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-62679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista and university stakeholders are exploring new methods to cope with current drought conditions given California Governor Jerry Brown’s state-mandated water restrictions issued earlier this month.</p>\n<p>State regulators discussed Brown’s water reduction rules this past Saturday, which cut urban potable water use by 25 percent statewide. According to a California State Water Boards press release, on March 17 the State Water Resources Control Board adopted emergency regulations that apply to all California residents, prohibiting runoff irrigation to non-irrigated areas, driveway and sidewalk washing and hose use without shutoff nozzles to wash vehicles. In addition, restaurants and other food service establishments have been mandated to only serve water to customers on request.</p>\n<p>UCSB Sustainability Recycling and Water Efficiency manager Matthew O’Carroll said the Goleta Water District has robust water conservation programs and relatively low per-capita water use in comparison to other water districts. According to O’Carroll, further water reductions at the university will require higher expenditures.</p>\n<p>“UCSB’s biggest challenge is achieving further potable water reductions,” O’Carroll said in an email. “Just last year, we reduced our potable water consumption 21% compared to the previous year and we are at a point now where we have picked a lot of the ‘low-hanging fruit.’ So future strategies that yield significant potable water savings will also have large upfront costs.”</p>\n<p>According to O’Carroll, while reduction in potable water consumption is a top priority, water conservation for landscape maintenance is less of a priority due to the university’s use of recycled water.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is fortunate enough to have recycled water, a source of water that is of lesser quality than potable/drinking water, but which can be used for certain applications such as irrigation,” O’Carroll said. “Ninety percent of our campus is irrigated with recycled water, and to be honest, if we didn’t have this source, landscape and irrigation could possibly be our largest area of potable water consumption.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks Department (IVRPD) general manager Rodney Gould said that while recycled water is beneficial to the university in water conservation, it is inaccessible in Isla Vista due to lack of funds.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately the distribution lines for recycled water stop at UCSB and don’t reach Isla Vista,” Gould said. “We asked Goleta Water District if they would extend the pipes but they indicated they don’t have the funds to do so. If we can find the funding for the infrastructure, they would provide the water.”</p>\n<p>According to Gould, while IVRPD has made significant cuts in water consumption in the past few years, more conservation efforts will be necessary with potentially increasing rates based on a Stage 3 surcharge.</p>\n<p>“With proposed changes in Goleta Water District’s billing structure, the District could potentially experience a $38,000 annual rate increase,” Gould said. “We’ve been watching our water usage very carefully and on average have cut back by 25 percent as compared to the 2012-2013 fiscal year. We’re also in the process of auditing the irrigation in all of our parks looking for leaks, and calculating usage in specific areas.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Food Co-op produce manager Rebekah Miles said local produce suppliers have been hit the hardest, while the Co-op itself has not been greatly affected by the water shortages.<br>\n“For example, we usually have a constant supply of local avocados, but this is the first time in the four-and-a-half years I’ve been here that we’ve had a three month gap in avocado supply,” Miles said.</p>\n<p>Miles also said in addition to water shortage, farmers have been dealing with various pests that are especially prevalent during droughts, such as the bagrada bug that feasts on brassica, a certain leafy green produce.</p>\n<p>“Brassicas include cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower and various other leafy greens, all of which we carry at the Co-op,” Miles said. “Organics do not use pesticides, so these bugs are really causing problems especially in dry conditions.”</p>\n<p>O’Carroll said members of the UCSB Bren School formed the Water Action Plan in 2013 after the university surpassed the 20 percent potable water use reduction goal by 2020 mandated by UC Office of the President. According to O’Carroll, developing the Water Action Plan helped identify the major consumers of potable water on campus, which are bathrooms and labs, primarily in academic buildings and residence halls.</p>\n<p>“The majority of our potable water consumption is in academic buildings and in residential housing,” O’Carroll said. “In academic buildings we are looking at more efficient water fixtures in both bathrooms and the lab setting.”</p>\n<p>O’Carroll said in addition to short-term modifications to conserve water, such as bathroom retrofitting, educational campaigns are also a part of Housing and Residential Services water conservation efforts.</p>\n<p>“Housing and Residential Services has continued their commitment to conserving water and has continued to outfit the residence halls with efficient fixtures and also have a very robust education and outreach program,” O’Carroll said.</p>\n<p>Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) co-chairs third-year biology major Heather Vest and third-year environmental studies major Jennifer Suh said in a joint statement that changing personal eating habits is one of the most difficult parts about conserving water.</p>\n<p>“One method to reduce is cutting down on water-intensive food choices such as almonds, meat and walnuts, which use a hearty supply of water to produce,” Vest and Suh said in an email. “So much of California’s water usage is agricultural, so it’s important to consume less.”</p>\n<p>According to Vest and Suh, water conservation is most significant at the individual level.</p>\n<p>“As students at UCSB, we often find it difficult to see any effects on our lives personally because with the ways we live, we don’t pay for our water sources within campus and/or Isla Vista housing, so many students do not see the need to decrease our water usage,” Vest and Suh said. “But we need to make choices every day that show we are conscious of the situation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/","id":4724,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[4723,4722,4721],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Attendees of Thursday’s meeting discussed details for events such as the candlelight vigil on March 23 and the memorial paddle out on May 27, in addition to new ideas for crafts using recycled materials, potlucks at the food Co-op and Zumba dancing.</p>\n<p>A.S.

Food Co-op Outreach and Education Coordinator Ashley Audycki said the Co-op wanted to host a potluck at the Pardall Center, and the meeting attendees decided the dinner should take place May 25.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and linguistics major and IVTU Vice President Alexandra Meallet said there should be forums for open discussion surrounding the series of memorial events.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s still a time when we’re becoming more comfortable with speaking about it [the May 23 tragedy] and I think open group discussion is pretty healthy,” Meallet said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Pardall Center staff member Natalie Dimas said her sorority Sigma Alpha Zeta has been discussing arranging a Zumba class if they could secure funding and coordinate with the Pardall Center staff.</p>\n<p>“Dancing can relieve stress and it is a method of coping,” Dimas said. “I’ve been looking around and seeing if I could find a Zumba instructor that would provide the class at a reduced price, if anything.”</p>\n<p>Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) Director Jeanne Stanford said it is important to remember individuals cope with tragedy in different ways and to be respectful of other’s methods if they differ from your own.</p>\n<p>“I am aware of people who don’t want to hear anything else about it … and then there’s people that want to remember it,” Stanford said. “Whether you want to turn away from it or you want to delve into it, we shouldn’t be judging each other.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said C.A.P.S. staff will be available for anyone who wants to talk about the events of May 23 last year, but will not push their services on anyone who does not approach them.</p>\n<p>“We are not saying that anybody needs counseling,” Stanford said. “We didn’t do that last year, because we had just drop-in consultation, because it was an unusual event.”</p>\n<p>Audycki said she thinks local art stores would be willing to help provide craft supplies for an artistic-themed event to commemorate the tragedy and help students heal.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be really therapeutic for some people to be able to create with something that could’ve been destroyed,” Audycki said.</p>\n<p>Puentes said one goal of the memorial events is to tailor them to the variety of ways that students can cope with last year’s tragedy and find healing through community.</p>\n<p>“A lot of what we are trying to do is help people access a lot of different ways to be involved, whether it’s more actively or passively,” Puentes said. “We definitely want to make sure that we have mental health and counselling services available to people in a place that is in the community.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said the memorial events will provide an opportunity to honor the students lost and restore faith in humanity.</p>\n<p>“Naturally, as human beings, we remember what happened,” Stanford said. “What we’re doing with remembrances and anniversary events are about community and about restoring people’s faith in humanity.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/i-v-organizations-meet-to-discuss-memorial-events/","id":4726,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[4725,4724,4723],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
