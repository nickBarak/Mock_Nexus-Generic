The plaintiff alleges that the Sheriff’s Department violated their own Law Enforcement Services Manual by not investigating the department’s former incidents of contact with Rodger and not performing a background check on California’s gun registration system after receiving complaints about Rodger’s violent tendencies. Cherchian’s brief also alleges the county, Sheriff’s Department and the UC Regents violated policy manuals, the Psychiatric Emergency Team Regulations and the Firearm Policy  by not requesting or providing a mental health evaluation by a licensed clinician after receiving a welfare check request from Rodgers’s mother, Chin Rodgers, on April 30, 2014.</p>\n<p>Because of these violations, Cherchian alleges the defendants deprived him of his right to be free from personal injury and threat of death, claiming each of the accused are legally responsible for the injuries and damages he sustained on May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p>The case brief states the Sheriff’s Department and the Regents acted irresponsibly by not acting on the readily available information Rodger himself posted on public websites, which included multiple videos posted to YouTube under his name expressing violent threats. According to the case brief, the Sheriff’s Department also failed to perform a check on the California gun registry or interview any of Rodger’s mental health providers, despite their ability to consult the registry where information on his possession of firearms would have been available.</p>\n<p>“Recklessly and with deliberate indifference … no person from the SBCSD [Sheriff’s Department] or the Regents watched any part of any videos, reviewed any of Rodger’s other online postings, performed any kind of gun ownership or background check, or interviewed any mental health provider where Rodger was a known psychiatric patient,” the case brief states.</p>\n<p>Cherchian’s brief also alleges the Sheriff’s Department is essentially responsible for putting those around Rodger in danger because of their lack of investigation into his background and unstable nature.</p>\n<p>“Through their conduct, the officers impliedly affirmed that Rodger was not dangerous to the public, increasing the existing danger to his roommates, their guests, and the general public, living and interacting with Rodger on a daily basis in the college community about him,” the case brief states.</p>\n<p>According to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office final investigative summary report on the I.V. mass murder released on Feb. 19, while six law enforcement officers responded to the welfare check request made by Chin Rodger, the sheriff’s deputies found no risk factors that justified a search of Rodger’s apartment or an involuntary mental health hold.</p>\n<p>“[Rodger] explained he was having trouble fitting in socially in Isla Vista,” the report states. “The videos were merely a way of expressing himself. There was nothing during the contact with the suspect that gave deputies reason to believe he was a danger to himself or others.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry and math major Jose Brizuela said he believes the Sheriff’s Department should not be the target of Cherchian’s lawsuit because he feels law enforcement did their jobs to the best of their ability.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel like the sheriffs should be the people they go for because they were just doing their job to begin with,” Brizuela said. “Even when everything happened, they tried their hardest to stop [Rodger].”</p>\n<p>Brizuela also said this lawsuit may set a precedent for more victims to come forward against the Sheriff’s Department, the Regents and the County.</p>\n<p>“If this guy’s medical bills get paid off and whatever he wants to gets paid off, I’m sure other people will try and do the same,” Brizuela said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year mechanical engineering major Caroline Park said Rodger’s parents are more to blame than the Sheriff’s Department because she believes they were aware Rodger had purchased weapons and was a potential danger.</p>\n<p>“When I first read about the case, I definitely thought that his parents were more in the wrong than anyone else,” Park said. “They had the most information. They knew he had guns. They knew that he was dangerous.”</p>\n<p>According to the report on the shooting, Rodger’s parents had been informed by his life coach about the manifesto and YouTube videos, but had no knowledge of his weapons and did not view him as a threat to others.</p>\n<p>“Sheriff’s detectives … spoke with both of the suspect’s parents, Peter and Chin Rodger, by telephone. The parents were in the process of driving to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles,” the report states. “Both were worried about their son based on the manifesto that had been emailed earlier that evening, but they both found it very difficult to believe that their son either owned weapons or would actually hurt anyone.”</p>\n<p>Park also said the Sheriff’s Department has a duty to protect the rights of citizens living in I.V. and were in a difficult position during the welfare check on April 30, 2014. Park said she believes that if law enforcement had searched Rodger’s apartment and found nothing, it would be assumed they were violating his rights and would set a bad precedent.</p>\n<p>“I think either way it could have gone wrong. If they were able to search his house and find something, that would have been great,” Park said. “But if it didn’t happen that way, that would be violating his rights. That could happen to any one of us in I.V. and I think that sets a bad example.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Director of news and media relations at the Office of Public Affairs, George Foulsham, declined to comment on the case, stating the university does not comment on pending litigation.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the Santa Barbara County Counsel and Cherchian’s legal team did not respond to requests for comment.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62001\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62001\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/","id":4758,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[4757,4756,4755],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Rides Win Streak Into Midweek Matchup Against CSU Bakersfield","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Baseball-UCDavis_Hari-Patel_05012015-0785139-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Baseball-UCDavis_Hari-Patel_05012015-0785139-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After sweeping conference opponent UC Davis, the No. 7 UCSB baseball team faces CSUB in non-league game.

With its 28-17-1 overall and 14-6-1 conference record, Bakersfield falls second in the Western Athletic Conference only to GCU.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In last week’s midweek game, junior righty lefty Domenic Mazza pitched through eight innings, allowing only three runs in seven hits in his appearance. However, in that game four Gaucho relievers would see play during the course of the long 13 innings. Overall, last Tuesday’s pitching staff threw nine scoreless innings against LMU and struck out 13, but allowed six total runs.</p>\n<p>In the past week, the Gaucho offense has put up 17 runs and 47 hits against opposing pitchers. Only six of those hits were for more than a single, including one home run by senior third baseman Peter Maris and four doubles.</p>\n<p>In the WAC this week, Bakersfield’s sophomore righty Garrett Nimmo was named Pitcher of the Week. In the team’s 5-4 win over Cal Poly last Tuesday, he appeared for seven innings allowing no runs, three hits and striking out nine Mustangs.</p>\n<p>As for pitching in the Big West, UCSB’s junior righty Dillon Tate still comes in second in overall earned run average to Long Beach State’s freshman right-handed pitcher Chris Mathewson who paces the conference with a 1.39 ERA. Tate falls just behind with a 1.63 ERA. UCSB’s sophomore righty Shane Bieber rounds out the top-five conference leaderboard with his own 2.05 ERA.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s starting pitching staff also claims the third, fourth and fifth spot in conference strikeout leaders. Tate holds third with 84, next is junior lefty Justin Jacome with 75 and Bieber in fifth with 74.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho lineup also houses two offensive leaders in senior outfielder Cameron Newell and junior right-handed pitcher and utility player Robby Nesovic. Newell leads the conference in overall batting average as he hits for .374 and Nesovic brings up the fifth spot swinging for .363.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take the field today at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium for the last time this week as they travel to play a three-game series against Cal State Fullerton starting Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63083\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/ucsb-rides-win-streak-into-midweek-matchup-against-csu-bakersfield/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63083\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/ucsb-rides-win-streak-into-midweek-matchup-against-csu-bakersfield/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/ucsb-rides-win-streak-into-midweek-matchup-against-csu-bakersfield/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/ucsb-rides-win-streak-into-midweek-matchup-against-csu-bakersfield/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-05/ucsb-rides-win-streak-into-midweek-matchup-against-csu-bakersfield/","id":4759,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[4758,4757,4756],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"First Place Gauchos Look to Build Separation Against Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A strong showing this weekend could help No. 6 UCSB take control atop the Big West","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63188\" style=\"width: 682px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/vs-CSUB-5-5-15-1-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1483586098\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63131\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63188\" data-attachment-id=\"63188\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/first-place-gauchos-look-to-build-separation-against-fullerton/domenic-mazza-throws-a-pitch-jose-ochoadaily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/vs-CSUB-5-5-15-1-print.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5184,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T3i\",\"caption\":\"Domenic Mazza throws a pitch.

[CSUF is] starting to play well and we’ve played well,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We have a battle in front of us, and it’ll be competitive. It’ll be a hostile crowd and all of that. It should be fun; that’s why we play college baseball.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho pitching staff will show its normal rotation including appearances from its three usual weekend starters. Junior righty Dillon Tate enters this weekend’s start on the road with a 1.63 earned run average, which sets him second in overall conference ERA. In Tate’s seven wins this season, he has struck out 84 opposing batters.</p>\n<p>Junior lefty Justin Jacome also stands alongside Tate among the conference leaders. Jacome yields the seventh best ERA in the conference at 2.24, and in his seven wins he has struck out 75 batters. The only sophomore of the starting core, righty Shane Bieber, also tops league standings. Bieber ranks fifth among ERA leaders hurling a 2.01 ERA and with six wins under his belt, has struck out 74.</p>\n<p>All of the four Gaucho starters, including Tuesday starter junior lefty Domenic Mazza, are pitching for under a 2.50 ERA. UCSB collectively holds a NCAA-best 2.07 ERA.</p>\n<p>“I always feel good about our starting pitching and know that they’ll give us a chance,” Checketts said. “There’s always a shot that they’ll blow up and have a bad start, but we haven’t had a lot of those, so I feel pretty good about our chances.”</p>\n<p>Gaucho offensive leader senior outfielder Cameron Newell did not start on Tuesday against Bakersfield, nor did junior utility player and right-handed pitcher Robby Nesovic. Nesovic has been unable to play due to a reported injured hand, but looks hopeful for play action in this weekend’s series.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully [Tuesday’s loss] will fire us up and want to go and compete even more to win the series against Fullerton this weekend,” freshman shortstop Clay Fisher said. “I think we’re going about our business and doing our thing and not worrying too much about other teams, but really focusing on ourselves.”</p>\n<p>In the absence of the team’s two dominant hitters, the Gaucho lineup has switched from its traditional order. Senior infielder Woody Woodward has batted as the team’s leadoff hitter in three of the past four games.</p>\n<p>In that time, Woodward has had a pair of two-hit games, and a solo one-hit appearance. Hitting in the two-spot is senior third baseman Peter Maris who has put up two hits every game for the past six games.</p>\n<p>“I would hope [the offense] sticks to its approaches and starts to find a hold on more of the barrel and translate that into hits,” Mazza said.</p>\n<p>One standout Fullerton batter is junior outfielder Josh Vargas, who is putting up a .364 batting average. Vargas also leads the conference in on-base percentage with a .479 OBP. Fullerton junior Thomas Eshelman is also putting up high numbers on the mound, as he is currently throwing for the league’s fourth-best ERA at 1.94.</p>\n<p>“This [weekend] is huge.
