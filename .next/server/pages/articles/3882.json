As the man’s growing frustration got the better of him, he began to cry.</p>\n<p>Officers then arrested the man for public intoxication. While deputies transported him to jail, the man became very emotional and again started to cry.</p>\n<p>The subject confessed that his girlfriend had just broken up with him, and he had only wanted to give her a birthday card. The man admitted that he had made a mistake by drinking too much “cheap” vodka and apologized to officers for getting plastered.</p>\n<p>The man was booked at the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>A Flash of Brilliance Belligerence<br>\nFriday, Nov. 10, 5:20 a.m. – Officers walking by a bus stop on Camino del Sur observed a 21-year-old man lying on a bench.</p>\n<p>As a deputy approached the man, he saw that the subject’s pants were unzipped and his penis was exposed. The man was lying in a pool of urine, which streamed down the bench into a nearby gutter.</p>\n<p>The officer attempted to wake the leaky lawbreaker by shouting at the subject, but eventually had to administer a sternum rub to elicit a response.</p>\n<p>When the wiz kid woke up, he was extremely disoriented and repeatedly told officers that he lived on “Ryan Street.”</p>\n<p>Since that street does not exist anywhere near Isla Vista, the officer decided to arrest the filthy flasher for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed and left to mull over his own mess, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>All I Want to Do Is Bicycle!!!<br>\nSaturday, Nov. 25, 9:15 p.m. – Deputies were patrolling the 6700 block of El Colegio Road when they saw a 22-year-old man zoom past them on a bicycle.</p>\n<p>As the subject sped past the officers, he fell off the bike and flew through the air, before ultimately crashing on to the pavement. He stumbled for several yards before regaining his balance.</p>\n<p>In a rage, the man picked up his bike and threw it to the ground. He then flopped down on to the street, where he sat, pouting, until an officer approached him.</p>\n<p>The deputy detected a strong odor of alcohol and noticed that the surly cyclist’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy. When the officer began questioning the subject, the man attempted to answer -but only managed to say, “I live at 555… ah… I’m not sure.”</p>\n<p>Despite the commendable effort to remember where he lived, the man was completely oblivious to his surroundings and could not even stand up. To ensure the man’s own safety, the officer arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The subject was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Nikki Moore</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-12648\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-12648\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-27/police-blotter-13/","id":3882,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3881,3880,3879],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff","biography":"Not available","articles":[3362,3538,3539,3541,3553,3570,3697,3843,3844,3845,3846,3847,3848,3849,3850,3851,3852,3862,3871,3872,3873,3874,3875,3879,3880,3881,3882,3885,3886,3888,3889,3892,3893,3894,3896,3897],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2006-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Friday, Nov. 3, 11:59 p.m. - Isla Vista Foot Patrol Officers on uniformed patrol observed a 23-year-old man stumble down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive and nearly fall to the ground.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Friday, Nov. 3, 11:59 p.m. – Isla Vista Foot Patrol Officers on uniformed patrol observed a 23-year-old man stumble down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive and nearly fall to the ground.</p>\n<p>A deputy began to approach the subject, but before he could get close to the man, the suspect hit the pavement – and rolled around on the street before coming to rest in a seated position.</p>\n<p>The officer helped the man to his feet, and began questioning him – first requesting the subject’s ID.</p>\n<p>The man began a thorough search of his pockets for his driver license, but then whipped out a package of joint-rolling papers and passed them to the officer.</p>\n<p>Because the thin sheets of paper did not contain any useful information, the man pulled out his wallet, and again tried to find his ID – but only managed to spill the billfold’s contents onto the grass.</p>\n<p>The deputy decided that the chronic offender – who admitted to a prior arrest for public intoxication – was unable to care for his safety and arrested him for being drunk in public.</p>\n<p>The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Saturday, Nov. 4, 1:19 a.m. – Deputies walking down the 6600 block of DP observed a 20-year-old man urinating off the balcony of someone else’s home.</p>\n<p>After finishing his business, the sloshed subject then attempted to enter the apartment, but was intercepted by a group of Foot Patrol officers.</p>\n<p>When they began questioning the man, he was unable to tell the deputies which street he lived on.
