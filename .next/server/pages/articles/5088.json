On the right wing of the court at the other opposite position is senior Britton Taylor, who recorded 10 kills. At the net, junior middle blockers Phoebe Grunt and Elizabeth Sheffield emerged for stellar hitting nights as Grunt earned 13 kills and Sheffield ended with 11.</p>\n<p>The catalysts for UCSB’s success on offense were both setters, senior Hanna Nielson and freshman Annie Hasselmann. Nielson finished with a match-high 30 kills while Hasselmann had 21 on the night. The duo’s total of 51 assists contributed to the team finishing with a season-high of 59.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite a compelling performance the previous night, Santa Barbara could not follow up its win as it was swept by UC Riverside on Saturday. UCSB loss in straight sets by scores of 15-25, 23-25, and 21-25.</p>\n<p>The victory over the Titans ended UCSB’s five-match losing streak heading into the weekend, but Saturday’s outcome added another loss to the Gauchos’ records of 7-18 overall and 3-11 in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton continues to plummet after Friday’s loss and being swept by Cal Poly on Saturday. The Titans sit at 0-26 overall, 0-14 in conference matches, matching their second worst start in program history.</p>\n<p>However, it was a historic ending to the weekend for the Highlanders as they broke a program record for conference wins, earning their fifth in the sweep of UCSB. The 3-0 victory was the team’s second sweep of the season, creating another UCR record.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s quick start to open the match against CSUF led to it maintaining the lead throughout the entirety of the first set. An early 4-0 scoring run handed the Gauchos an 8-3 lead but would be trimmed as the Titans answered back with a 4-1 run of their own to pull within two at 7-9.</p>\n<p>Having the best season in her collegiate career, Grunt’s surge of three consecutive kills helped to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to 13-7. Her 13 kills matched a season-high in attacks to go along with a .346 hitting clip. Grunt was the only Gaucho to record a solo block.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the first set with a .368 hitting percentage, holding Fullerton to a .135 clip for the 25-15 victory and 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Fullerton slowed down UCSB’s attack to a .286 hitting percentage in the second set and took an early 5-2 lead. But the Titans’ short stint of scores did not last long as they could not surpass the Gauchos’ defensive prowess.</p>\n<p>In addition to CSUF’s six errors, Santa Barbara allowed just seven kills to hold the Titans to a .028 hitting percentage. The Gauchos’ 76 digs were their second-most in a match this season. Leading UCSB in defensive scoops was freshman libero Emilia Petrachi with a match-high 26.</p>\n<p>Exchanges of scoring runs between the two teams resulted in Fullerton taking a 13-10 lead, ensuing a UCSB timeout.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the timeout was a reinvigorated Santa Barbara team as it achieved a 4-0 scoring rally of its own to force a CSUF timeout. But the Gauchos’ dominance persisted, extending into an 11-1 run that put them up 21-14 and eventually led to a 25-19 set victory.</p>\n<p>Five of Grunt’s 13 kills appeared during the set while UCSB notched four of its nine service aces as well, the total being its second-most this season.</p>\n<p>CSUF countered with an outstanding .448 hitting percentage in the third set. Most notably, Fullerton never trailed as it had 13 kills and zero errors.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Katelyn Nielsen provided the spark to the Titans’ 16-5 run, tallying an individual 5-1 scoring run. She finished with a career-high 13 kills and helped lead Fullerton to its 25-14 win to cut the Gauchos’ lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>But Nielsen’s breakout performance was not enough to prevent UCSB from taking a 25-17 win in the final set for the 3-1 victory. UCSB’s .371 hitting percentage to end the match was its highest for the evening. Another four aces would appear as Sheffield had a match-high three.</p>\n<p>While neither team hit over a .300 clip in any set of Saturday’s match, UC Riverside’s offense was just enough to edge UCSB, specifically in the final two sets.</p>\n<p>Villanueva registered another double digit hitting performance with 12 kills but was outperformed by the excellent attack of UCR’s senior outside hitter Helena Peric.

He has a standard order that consists of an agave latte, a cheese bagel with plain cream cheese and lemon pepper and a bottle of orange juice on occasion. He has a serious love for breakfast food in general, but he lists bagels as his absolute favorite and jokes about a period of time where that was all he ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>\n<p>During the interview, friends passing by bombard him with hellos. Like any UCSB athlete, Gronow is well-known in the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>However, unlike many that might just return a simple, “Hello,” Gronow gives his full attention to each individual that approaches him. Not only was he participating in a detailed, one-on-one interview, but he was also making time for and expressing genuine interest in every conversation.</p>\n<p>This caring attitude comes as a result of striving to live out of honor for his dad.</p>\n<p>“When I was younger, it was embarrassing; he would strike up conversations with everyone,” Gronow said. “I didn’t realize it at the time, but now that I think about it, if I could have one trait about me from him, it would be the ability to be personable with everyone.”</p>\n<p>Gronow describes himself as always being a family man, but the recent passing of his dad gave a whole new meaning to the importance of loved ones.</p>\n<p>“With Dad passing away, something clicked in my mind … things can happen,” said Gronow.</p>\n<p>He explained that most people have been surprised by his ability to talk so openly and honestly about the situation, but he credits his amazing support system for this newfound strength.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara, Gronow is constantly surrounded by his teammates, whom he describes as being the best distraction from the situation. When Head Coach Wolf Wigo first broke the news to the team, Gronow remembers his phone lighting up for hours with text messages and calls from all of his teammates and their family members.</p>\n<p>“I will never forget these guys; they are definitely family,” said Gronow. “It sounds weird, but I know their smells … I could tell you a million things about each of them.”</p>\n<p>Back home in Australia, Gronow’s support comes from his immediate family. He describes his older siblings Chris and Ali and his mom as being the biggest influences on the person he is today.</p>\n<p>Gronow grew up in Essendon, Australia, a suburban neighborhood just outside of Melbourne. He spent his younger days shadowing his older brother Chris and constantly seeking advice from his sister Ali. When asked about his mom he says flat out, “My mum is crazy.” After a brief pause, he laughs and admits to being a total momma’s boy.</p>\n<p>When he was younger, he never shared the common childhood ideal of becoming a firefighter or an astronaut, but instead has always dreamed of standing atop a podium, medal in hand, representing his country as an Olympian.</p>\n<p>“Pretty much everything about his game has improved,” Wigo said. “He has put himself in a position where that is definitely a reality in the future if he chooses that path.”</p>\n<p>After an early morning of practice and breakfast at Cajé, Gronow heads across the street to his job at Embarcadero Hall. He works in a small office off the main lecture hall where he assists professors in prepping their power points and setting up their microphones.</p>\n<p>After a short two-hour shift, it’s back to the long-term Olympic grind. Gronow heads to the athletic training center to meet his teammates for an afternoon of weights.</p>\n<p>Walking into the training center, “Get on My Level,” by Wiz Khalifa plays in the background as workout motivation, but that doesn’t last long. Gronow walks into the trainer’s office and changes the music from rap to a playlist that gives off more of a modern, Ellie Goulding vibe. He says he doesn’t like rap music, and describes Jack Johnson as more his style.</p>\n<p>Although all of the players are completing their training circuits individually, their playful conversations and joking mannerisms in between sets make it apparent that they function as a single team unit.</p>\n<p>“He has done a great job as captain keeping the guys motivated and keeping the team together as a group,” Wigo said. “It has been the most consistent year for UCSB in a really long time, and he has contributed to that.”</p>\n<p>Gronow approached his role as team captain and leader through living by example. He believes it is better to create an equal relationship between the older and younger guys on the team by helping them choose their classes and hanging out with them outside of water polo.</p>\n<p>With only one month left in Santa Barbara before his graduation, Gronow hopes to say goodbye to the hundreds of people that have offered him friendship and have contributed to the ultimate California experience. He will then return to his native Australia to continue to play competitive water polo.</p>\n<p>Gronow is truly a product of his environment. With his appearance branded by sunshine and chlorine, and his heart molded by his amazing community of family and friends, he approaches each day with the goal of living passionately.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 19th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53089\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/matt-gronow-a-genuine-gaucho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53089\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/matt-gronow-a-genuine-gaucho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/matt-gronow-a-genuine-gaucho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/matt-gronow-a-genuine-gaucho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/matt-gronow-a-genuine-gaucho/","id":5085,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5084,5083,5082],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 16 UCSB Opens Season at Winter Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6-peter-vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.24.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Water_.Polo_.vs_.SJSU-6-peter-vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB opened the season with a 2-5 record at the UCSB Winter Invitational this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Kicking its season off as the hosts for the UCSB Winter Invite, the No. 16 UCSB women’s water polo team began its year with a 2-5 start this past weekend.</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos’ solid start to the year quickly turned into a tough five game losing streak, their opening weekend finale against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps proved to be their best performance thus far.

After the Bears got out to a quick 4-0 lead after the first quarter, sophomore utility Samantha Murphy scored the Gauchos’ first goal of the game to cut the lead to three. However, the Bears answered back with four more consecutive goals heading into halftime.</p>\n<p>Going into the third quarter with a large deficit, sophomore attacker Bryn Hudson gave the Gauchos their second goal of the match. Cal answered with three goals of its own, taking a dominant 11-2 lead into the final period. Junior utility Lauren Martin was one of the few bright spots for UCSB during the game, scoring two goals in the fourth quarter, but the Gauchos were outplayed once again and finally fell 14-4.</p>\n<p>Playing No. 5 Arizona State early on Saturday, Santa Barbara came out strong with Martin scoring the game’s opening goal. The Sun Devils answered with three goals of their own, but freshman attacker Carly Christian scored two straight before the end of the first period, making it a one-goal deficit at 4-3 heading into the second.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos again started the second quarter strong as Hudson scored first to tie it at four goals apiece, but Arizona State began to pull away with another three consecutive scores heading into the half.</p>\n<p>In the second half, UCSB found goals from freshman attacker Jenna Solberg and Murphy, but the team was unable to pull off the comeback and lost 11-6 for its second-straight loss.</p>\n<p>Against No. 8 San Jose State Friday afternoon, the Gauchos’ offense got off to a slow start. UCSB was shutout in the first quarter but its strong defense kept them in the game by giving up only one goal.</p>\n<p>Just after the second quarter began, Hudson tied the game at 1-1. As they did multiple times over the weekend, though, the Gauchos gave up three consecutive goals to the Spartans and went into the half trailing 4-1.</p>\n<p>To have any shot at coming back, UCSB needed a big second half, and it got one. Martin scored two goals, including one coming off of a set, and Christian added another to give the Gauchos three in the quarter and head into the fourth trailing 6-4.</p>\n<p>In a tightly contested fourth quarter, UCSB took the game down to the wire. Hudson scored her second goal, and Martin scored two more to bring her total to four on the day. Still trailing 8-7, Christian tied the game.</p>\n<p>However, with just 1:11 remaining, San Jose State was able to beat sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw and come away with a 9-8 victory. Brokaw ended the game with eight saves.</p>\n<p>In their first game of the season, the Gauchos were brought down to earth quickly as they gave up a goal just 15 seconds into the match. Sophomore utility Jessie Porter answered back to tie it at one and Christian scored her first career goal to give her team the lead.</p>\n<p>Before the end of the half, Christian contributed her second goal of the match while sophomore utility Michelle Dunn and freshman utility Megan Linder also scored to give UCSB a 5-3 lead at the half. In the third, Martin scored once more to make it 6-3.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to hold on in a low-scoring fourth quarter, ending the game with a 7-6 win and their first of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB gets next weekend off before heading on the road for the UCSD Triton Invite on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/no-16-ucsb-opens-season-at-winter-invite/","id":5086,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[5085,5084,5083],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes 2-2 at UCSD Triton Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/womens-water-polo_for-02.10_Peter-Vandenbelt-4-of-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/womens-water-polo_for-02.10_Peter-Vandenbelt-4-of-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Over the weekend in San Diego, the Gauchos defeated Marist and San Diego State but fell to Loyola Marymount and UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After getting off to a rough start to the season, the No. 18 UCSB women’s water polo team went into the UCSD Triton Invite hungry for wins.
