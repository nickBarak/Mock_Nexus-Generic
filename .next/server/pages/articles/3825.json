There, lying face down, was a victim of overconsumption, dreaming drunken dreams.</p>\n<p>His head half hanging out the opened door, the 19-year-old man was a sight to behold. Chunks of vomit clung to his face, covered his hands, stained his T-shirt and saturated the car seat. A few select chunks had made their way out of the car and were pooled in the gutter.</p>\n<p>The officers shook the sleeping beauty awake, taking extra care not to get vomit on their hands, and collected the out-of-towner’s information. Hoping not to have to arrest him, the deputies asked if the defeated reveler had any friends who could assist him.</p>\n<p>The puking prince told them José would come to his rescue and he pulled out his phone to dial him. However, after shouting his name several times, the officers asked to see the phone and discovered the soiled young man had never dialed the number.</p>\n<p>With no José, the deputies had no recourse but to arrest the young man. A few untimely upchucks notwithstanding, the intoxicated tourist was transferred without incidence to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Fast Times at Estero Park</b></p>\n<p>Sat Jan. 16, 3:54 a.m. – Deputies working the late shift were intrigued when they spotted a car parked in Estero Park with its lights on.</p>\n<p>The officers, making sure not to stand in the pile of sick located beside the car door, shined their flashlights into the vehicle and saw two rather young-looking occupants, one a man and one a woman. A simple tap on the window didn’t wake the slumbering out-of-towners, however, nor did aggressive banging.</p>\n<p>The IVFP doesn’t employ quitters, though, and after nearly two minutes of trying, the deputies were able to wake the sloppy sleepers. What was awaiting them inside the car, however, no one can be trained for.</p>\n<p>First was the smell, horrid and acidic. Next the visual, two young bodies covered entirely in their own puke. Vomit was in their hair, on their clothing, covering their seats and pooled on the floor.</p>\n<p>Two grown adults could live with such an experience – at least their parents wouldn’t have to know. But these vomit-covered visitors were not so lucky: each was only 16 years of age.</p>\n<p>Slightly taken aback, the deputies arrested the pair and transferred them to the Santa Maria Juvenile Hall, where they were housed, pending a serious ass-whopping from the ‘rents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

bus system is adding 14 new electric shuttles and introducing new farebox and smartphone technology to modernize its system as well as rebranding its 30-year-old logo.</p>\n<p>The Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) will accompany the technology with a new student access system in the next year, along with making changes to bus schedules beginning Aug. 21.</p>\n<p>According to reports by the American Public Transportation Association, UC Santa Barbara student ridership has increased by 31 percent from 2011 to 2016 — a contrast to the dropping rates both nationwide and in California.</p>\n<p>Nationwide ridership is decreasing, said Hillary Blackerby, MTD marketing and community relations manager, due in part to a sustained period of low gas prices and the change in landscape for transportation.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said they cannot point out a specific reason for declining ridership, but they are “definitely interested in competing for people’s ridership.”</p>\n<p>According to the MTD 2016-2021 Strategic Plan, “The vision of MTD is that public transit within the District should be so available and attractive that use of an automobile is a choice, not a necessity.”</p>\n<p>Despite national and statewide ridership trends, 14 new electric shuttles are being custom-made in Lancaster, CA, and after thorough training and testing, they will slowly be introduced to the district this summer.</p>\n<p>The new shuttles “show [their] commitment to the environment,” Blackerby said, and she hopes their schedule adjustments will improve bus arrival timing.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said the proposed schedule adjustments hope to combat traffic congestion, primarily near the Storke and Hollister intersection, which is caused by the new housing developments that have changed the traffic flow.</p>\n<p>MTD is also testing student ACCESS cards to see if they will be compatible with new fareboxes that will be installed later this year.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said the new boxes will work based off of a list of active student ID numbers that determine rider eligibility when a card is swiped. The boxes will replace the bus sticker system for UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students. MTD officials are still negotiating the details with the university, she said.</p>\n<p>A new smartphone app will also launch later this year to give real-time GPS tracking of buses en route, Blackerby said. The service will also be available via text for non-smartphone users.</p>\n<p>“As someone who has waited hours in line” at the A.S. Ticket Office to get a bus sticker, third-year history of public policy major and Off-Campus Senator Batsheva Stoll said she is looking forward to the new farebox system.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she believes this change will best serve students that live in the Santa Catalina dormitories because “They are the ones that use the bus the most to get to school.”</p>\n<p>Lines 12x and 24x, which run from UCSB to downtown Santa Barbara, will decrease in frequency, running every 35 minutes instead of the current 30 minutes. A few isolated trips will be removed throughout the day so the buses’ arrival times are more consistent.</p>\n<p>Lines 6, 11, 20, 21x, 23 and 25 will be slightly adjusted in timing but not reduced in frequency. A minor reroute will be made for Line 23 after 7 p.m. to accommodate the El Encanto Heights neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The UCSB and SBCC student line, 15x, will see a frequency increase of up to six minutes. An additional six trips in both directions will be added during “key parts of the day,” said Transit Planner Mark Clyde.</p>\n<p>Lines 1 and 2 will revert morning weekday commute hour services from 10-minute to 15-minute frequencies due to the loss of a grant source.</p>\n<p>The Nexus previously reported that a potential route from Goleta to Carpinteria during the morning and evening commute hours would become available through Caltrans funding. Blackerby told the <em>Nexus</em>, however, that Caltrans decided to not fund the project.</p>\n<p>“Their schedule is not tracking correctly with what is happening in reality, and to a lot of people [the changes] look like a cut at first, but I think they did a good job at clarifying,” said Director of the Isla Vista Community Services District Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>“It’s always better to have a schedule that is in line with reality so that folks don’t end up waiting at a bus stop,” said Brandt.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/considerable-changes-en-route-for-santa-barbara-bus-system/","id":3822,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[3821,3820,3819],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"And You May Find Yourself Sleeping on a Sidewalk\nSaturday, Sept. 29, 2:15 a.m. - Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Estero Road came upon an 18-year-old man snoring on the sidewalk.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>And You May Find Yourself Sleeping on a Sidewalk<br>\nSaturday, Sept. 29, 2:15 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6700 block of Estero Road came upon an 18-year-old man snoring on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>A deputy attempted to contact the man, but the sleeping subject was unresponsive to his directions.</p>\n<p>The officer – who may have gone to masseuse school before becoming a policeman – awoke the man by performing a sternum rub.

They then decided to arrest him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>During questioning and booking at the I.V.

Grey said the money would be used to add additional renovations like a shade structure and garage doors for outdoor use, a classroom space and upgrades to the kitchen, bathroom and lighting.</p>\n<p>The timing of the CDBG denial brought some concern to Isla Vistans following President Donald Trump’s America First budget proposal, which included slashing 13 percent of the Housing and Urban Development budget.</p>\n<p>Part of the budget cuts includes eliminating funding for the CDBG program. According to the federal Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) budget blueprint, the program “is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results.”</p>\n<p>Several Isla Vista projects have received funding from the CDBG program in past years. Jay Freeman, an I.V. Community Service District (CSD) board director, said some of the programs the CDBG has funded include the I.V. Youth Projects and the I.V. Sidewalk Improvement Project currently underway along Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>“[CDBG] is designed in order to provide infrastructure and housing upgrades for dense, underprivileged and complicated communities,” he said. “Not having that program anymore is going to make it a major complication to how we allocate resources.”</p>\n<p>U.S. Housing Secretary Ben Carson made additional statements on Thursday regarding the proposed cuts during a press conference in Miami, the <em>Miami Herald </em>reported.</p>\n<p>“What you need to concentrate on is: The parts of these programs that are functioning well — and that are maintaining people — are going to be preserved,” Carson said. “There may be a different nomenclature. We may not call it the same thing … We are clearly going to maintain these programs that are going very well.”</p>\n<p>In response to Carson’s statement, Freeman said it is not clear what he means.</p>\n<p>“For all we know, that means that they intend to keep some tax cuts that’s in there,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>The proposed elimination of the CDBG also comes during a time of budget shortage in Santa Barbara County. The county is currently looking at approximately $40 million in cuts, said Cameron Schunk, district representative for First District County Supervisor Das Williams.</p>\n<p>“Every year, we try our best to balance the budget and a lot of that money comes from grant funding,” Schunk said. “I think the key thing for people to understand is that this all translates into real world services that you and I use every day. It’s very easy to feel disconnected until you go to access a county service, and they say, ‘We don’t provide that anymore.’”</p>\n<p>Throughout the week, the county will be conducting budget workshops to consider proposals for the 2017-18 spending plan. Schunk said the departments were asked to overcut, so the proposed budgets include approximately $8 million worth of extra funding.</p>\n<p>“What we wanted to do was cut heavily and then be able to restore things that we thought were very critical,” Schunk said. “So of course we were going to have to make huge cuts, and there’s going to be big losses, but the idea is that we could minimize that by cutting huge [and] then going, ‘Okay, which thing do we want to restore or expand upon?’”</p>\n<p>One of such requests came from General Services, which asked for an additional $18,000 of general funds to be allocated for the community center’s ongoing maintenance. Jonathan Abboud, who serves as director on the board of the Isla Vista Community Development Corporation (IVCDC), said the money is necessary to preserve the center’s basic operations.</p>\n<p>“We’re sending a lot of people to the county budget hearing to speak up for Isla Vista,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Despite the lack of funding from the CDBG and proposed cuts to the county, I.V. stakeholders are still rooting for the community center’s success.</p>\n<p>In addition to the CDBG, the county also applied for the state’s Housing-Related Parks Program (HRP), offered to cities and counties with affordable housing programs. The grant could potentially bring in approximately $1.1 million to the I.V. community center project.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD director, who also plans on attending the county’s budget hearing on Wednesday in support of the community center, said people are excited about the HRP grant and believe it will revitalize the project.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited to see that it come to fruition,” Brandt said. “But in addition to that, I also think it’ll be important that the county continues to support the community center project even in their tough budgetary times. It’s important that the Isla Vista community lets the county know this is one of our priorities.”</p>\n<p>Besides the HRP grant, Isla Vistans are seeking other ways to fund the center through independent fundraising efforts. Brandt, who also serves as the director on the IVCDC, said the organization is actively soliciting donations from the community.</p>\n<p>“[We’re] letting folks know that Isla Vista is a great place to invest your money,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Schunk, who is also involved in the fundraising campaign as IVCDC’s president, said the denial of the CDBG is “not the end of the world.”</p>\n<p>“But certainly, I hope it lights a fire under folks and makes them understand that funding is critical,” he said. “Without it, there will be no community center.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77135\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77135\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/despite-budget-cuts-i-v-stakeholders-hold-out-hope-for-community-center/","id":3824,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[3823,3822,3821],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
