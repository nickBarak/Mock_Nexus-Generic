I don’t know if that was being on the road for the first time, or what it was, but we definitely need to be better.”</p>\n<p>Davis led the team with four blocks for the Gauchos, along with two kills. Senior outside hitter Blaine Nielsen led UCSB with nine kills, while junior outside hitter Miles Evans contributed seven, the first time all season he failed to lead the Gauchos in kills.</p>\n<p>UCLA proved to be efficient against UCSB, seldom making mistakes and limiting their errors to eight. The Gauchos, meanwhile, had seven errors in each of the three sets for 21 total.</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Bruins were on top of their game, blocking 22 shots with senior quick hitter Thomas Amberg posting a game-high six blocks to go along with five kills for a veteran UCLA squad.</p>\n<p>“Blocking was not as good as we need it to be, that’s for sure,” McLaughlin said. “We need to keep working on that.”</p>\n<p>Blocking continues to be a major concern for UCSB, as the Gauchos improved to block 12 shots, a major upgrade from the mere two against Stanford.</p>\n<p>“Blocking is a huge part of the game and I feel like we’re improving little by little,” Davis said. “I think we’re getting a bunch of good touches. But there’s still a lot more for us to do.”</p>\n<p>Continuing a Los Angeles road swing, the Gauchos travel to USC on Wednesday in search of their first conference victory. The No. 5 Trojans are 4-3 on the season (3-3 MPSF) and 2-0 in home contests, while UCSB is 0-1 on the road with the loss to UCLA. The Trojans sit in the middle of the pack in the MPSF at sixth place.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s match is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. in the Galen Center.</p><div

UCSB would hold that lead until two kills and a service ace from sophomore outside hitter Brianna Karsseboom gave the Aggies a game-point opportunity at 25-24.</p>\n<p>After trading scores, Elizabeth Sheffield’s kill tied the set at 26, and she and Chanel Hoffman blocked an attack attempt from Davis’ sophomore outside hitter Emily Allen to give the Gauchos a one-point lead.</p>\n<p>Allen would slip up again, as her attack error on the next point would give the Gauchos a victory in their first match of the weekend, and propel them to 2-2 overall in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Aggies had six players with double-digit points, paced by junior middle blocker Aima Eichie with 12 kills and 13.5 points.</p>\n<p>UCSB was in the lead in points and kills by Chanel Hoffman with 17 and 15 respectively, and Hannah Juley was everywhere with 43 assists and 11 digs. Elizabeth Sheffield and Rowan Ennis were also vital to the Gauchos, scoring with 9 and 12 kills apiece, while defensive specialists sophomore Emilia Petrachi and redshirt sophomore Sydney Bast combined for 27 digs to prop up the defense.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s matchup with Cal Poly featured more of the Gauchos’ bugaboos, as they were swept for the third time in conference play.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly bested UCSB in hitting percentage in each of the three sets, reaching a wild level of efficiency with a .419 mark in the final game.</p>\n<p>The match’s first set was as close as it gets, with both teams scoring in decisive outbursts. Cal Poly scored three straight early, only for UCSB to go on a 9-3 run.</p>\n<p>The two squads were within one or two points for the majority of the match, and after a back-and-forth sequence brought the score to 24-23 Cal Poly, a devastating block from sophomore outside hitter Adlee Van Winden and senior middle blocker Taylor Gruenewald on Rowan Ennis gave the Mustangs a one-set lead.</p>\n<p>Three Cal Poly kills again opened the next set, though the Mustangs had a much easier time maintaining their lead the second time around.</p>\n<p>UCSB was held at a distance throughout the set, and despite a late run, including a kill by redshirt freshman Lindsey Ruddins that brought the Gauchos within two, successful attacks from Van Winden and junior outside hitter Raeann Greisen put the Mustangs up 2-0.</p>\n<p>An early six-point run in the third set gave the Mustangs a 9-3 lead they wouldn’t relinquish for the remainder of the evening, as they played their best set of the match.</p>\n<p>Greisen (.423 hitting percentage) and Van Winden (13 kills, 11 digs) were the offensive fulcrums for Cal Poly, while sophomore libero Katherine Brouker contributed heavily on the defensive end with 14 digs of her own.</p>\n<p>Chanel Hoffman (13 kills), Rowan Ennis (nine kills, two assisted blocks) and Lindsey Ruddins (eight kills, .333 hitting percentage) all performed well for the Gauchos, as Ruddins at least was able to play in all three sets after seeing time in only two of the four on Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB sits at fourth in the Big West, tied with UC Davis and CSUN with a 2-3 conference record.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will hit the road this weekend for a Friday match at UC Riverside and a Saturday match at Cal State Fullerton.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73027\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/ucsb-capitalizes-against-uc-davis-falls-flat-vs-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73027\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/ucsb-capitalizes-against-uc-davis-falls-flat-vs-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/ucsb-capitalizes-against-uc-davis-falls-flat-vs-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/ucsb-capitalizes-against-uc-davis-falls-flat-vs-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-10/ucsb-capitalizes-against-uc-davis-falls-flat-vs-cal-poly/","id":5416,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5415,5414,5413],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Doubleheader for UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On the road for their furthest road trip of the season, the No. 12 UCSB men’s volleyball team will play a pair of games in Utah this weekend when they visit No. 3 BYU.

Earlier in the year, BYU swept the Gauchos in the UCSB/asics Invitational.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a challenge, it’s definitely an experience this team hasn’t been through,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “BYU is a very tough place to play usually because of the travel and they have a great crowd. They usually sell out their arena. It has about 5,000 people in it, and it’s loud and they’re a real good team. The challenge is huge; we’re going to just see what happens. We’re going to have a good game plan and compete well, and see where it ends up.”</p>\n<p>BYU, meanwhile, has come out victorious in their previous four matches, improving their record to 10-3 (6-2 MPSF). The Cougars are 4-2 at home this season, with both losses coming at the hands of No. 1 Stanford.</p>\n<p>“BYU is an environment unlike any other in our division,” freshman outside hitter Kevin Donohue said. “We will have a few fans there, but being in Utah, it’s going to be an entire gym full of BYU fans. It’s going to be intense, but I think guys on our team are actually looking forward to it, coming out there and playing in front of a crowd like that. It’s going to be a lot of fun, it’s going to be different and I think we’re going to enjoy it.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the Gaucho attack thus far in the season have been Donohue and junior outside hitter Miles Evans, who ranks third in the entire conference in kills per set.</p>\n<p>The Cougars feature a deadly weapon of their own in sophomore outside hitter Taylor Sander, the conference leader in kills per set at nearly five per game. BYU ranks fourth in the conference in kills and hitting percentage, featuring an efficient offense.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to definitely receive serves well and then on the other end, we’ve got to serve the ball well,” McLaughlin said. “If we can do those two things, then we’ll be in the match, and if you’re in the match, you’ve got a shot. If we don’t receive the serves well, then the match will be real one-sided because they have some athletes that are real hard to keep up with if we’re not perfectly in system off of a good pass.”</p>\n<p>Currently in 10th place in the conference, UCSB sits a mere game behind seventh place Long Beach for the all-important playoff spot the top eight teams in the conference receive. This road trip could go a long way in deciding the team’s fate.</p>\n<p>“We’re just going to have to stay focused,” Davis said. “Even if the crowd is really against us … we just have to keep pushing from point to point, and try to get the W.”</p>\n<p>This weekend’s matches will be held in Smith Fieldhouse.

Against Stanford, UCSB competed in every set, nearly upending the Cardinal before allowing the first and second sets to slip away.</p>\n<p>“That’s definitely something we’re still trying to work on, is keeping that level of energy throughout however many games is needed to finish it,” junior middle blocker Dylan Davis said. “I think with Stanford we had a little more consistency with it, but I think there is still more room for us to get better and keep bringing that energy.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos offensively thus far has been junior outside hitter Miles Evans, averaging four kills per set, good for fourth in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCLA defeated Northridge 3-0 on Wednesday to improve to 8-1 (3-0 MPSF), and has won six in a row entering Friday’s match against the Gauchos. The Bruins lead the MPSF in kills per set and senior quick hitters Weston Dunlap and Thomas Amberg are the top two players in the conference when it comes to hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>“[UCLA] got Northridge pretty good in three games straight. They beat them pretty soundly, so I don’t think they’ll be tired,” McLaughlin said. “It’s going to take us passing at a real high level and then we can compete with them. We’re going to have to play close to perfect.”</p>\n<p>The Bruins bring the number one defensive squad in the league, holding opponents to a conference-low .218 hitting percentage in the season while second in blocks with nearly three per set.</p>\n<p>“We’re definitely going to have to come out the same way we did against Stanford and battle point by point,” Evans said. “We need to focus on every detail in the game; we can’t let up at any moment.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we’re too worried about them stopping us, we have to worry about stopping them a little bit,” Evans said. “We know we can play, we’re not really worried about them taking us out of our game.”</p>\n<p>Dating back to last season, the Gauchos have defeated the Bruins in their last three regular season matches, all by 3-1 scores. UCSB can only hope today’s match goes as favorably.</p>\n<p>“They’re a really physical team,” Davis said. “I think it’s going to be important for us making sure we’re ready for the next play, never looking behind us or worrying about mistakes that we made. As long as we stay positive I think we should be able to score some points on these guys.”</p>\n<p>The match is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. in UCLA’s Wooden Center.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43977\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-league-win-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43977\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-league-win-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-league-win-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-league-win-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-27/gauchos-league-win-ucla/","id":5418,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[5417,5416,5415],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
