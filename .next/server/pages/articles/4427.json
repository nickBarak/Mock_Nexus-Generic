First Friday to backyard concerts, free vegan food, tree planting and more. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>FIRST FRIDAY</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ever wondered which bands are blasting rock music from Lot 22? Now’s your chance to get up close and personal with one of the bands, The Mallards, who will be performing at I.V.’s First Friday in Anisq’Oyo’ Park at 6 p.m. This event was originally scheduled for April 7 but was postponed due to inclement weather.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>COMEDY DEAL</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In need of some laughs? On the hunt for a good deal? Why not both? This Friday, Improvability will be hosting a “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” themed show, and tickets are buy one, get one free when you say the secret code word: bogo. There are two shows; the first is at 8 p.m. and the late-night show is at 10 p.m. Tickets to the first show are $3, $2 for the late night show. As always, those who go to the earlier show can stay for the late-night show free of charge. Organizers urge the audience to arrive at 7:45 p.m. to ensure they get a seat.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>MORE MUSIC</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If The Mallards didn’t quench your thirst for live music, have no fear. Get ready for a night with Crimes New Roman (The Lipsticks), “sweaty math punk” courtesy of Pookie, alt rock, emo, pop punk from the Six Sevens and “punk/indie/whatever” from Lawn Chairs, who will be kicking off their West Coast tour this Friday. The event will run from 9 p.m. to midnight at 6769 Del Playa Dr.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>TO SPEAK FOR THE TREES</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Your Children’s Trees will be planting and maintaining a coastal oak forest at Coal Oil Point Reserve from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday. Organizers advise that interested volunteers bring water and sun protection and wear closed-toe shoes and long pants that they don’t mind getting dirty. Biking to the reserve is also recommended. Your Children’s Trees is a student-run environmental organization that hopes to improve coastal runoff and the environment of Santa Barbara by planting trees to create a healthier ecosystem.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>ROCK ‘N’ ROLL</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Need more rock ‘n’ roll in your life? Look no further: The Crash Landings and Savage Henry will be performing “tasteful and respectable” rock ‘n’ roll for alumni weekend this Saturday at 9:30 p.m. on 938 Camino Corto.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>…EVEN MORE MUSIC?</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If rock ‘n’ roll isn’t punk enough for you, fear not. Punk and metal bands RabbitFoot and Samsara will be hosting a “djentlemanly” face-off this Saturday at 991 Camino Lindo. Samsara will be going on at 9:30 p.m. to perform “earsplitting” covers of “Riptide” and “Purple Rain.” RabbitFoot will be following directly after at 10:30 p.m. for a “br00tal demonstration of speed and girth.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>MEATLESS SUNDAY</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Food Not Bombs is a large organization that spans the country and is a form of “franchise activism.” They believe that corporate and government priorities are skewed and allow hunger despite the abundance of food waste.
