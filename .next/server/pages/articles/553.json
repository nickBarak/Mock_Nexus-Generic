You coach to win every game. The players play to win, so other than that it’s short-term memory and you get back to work.”</p>\n<p>Holding seventh place in the Big West, the Gauchos will have the opportunity to shake up the conference standings this weekend as Irvine sits just one place above them. The Anteaters are 9-10 overall and 2-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While most of its games have been played on the road, Irvine owns a perfect home record of 4-0.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem throughout conference play for UCSB has been consistency. In the team’s most recent loss to Cal State Fullerton, Santa Barbara played a solid first half, taking a 33-23 lead into halftime. However, the Gauchos broke down defensively in the second half, allowing the Titans 44 points.</p>\n<p>“I feel like a broken record, but we have to continue to do what we usually do, especially with defense,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “At this point in the season, everyone needs to know their role. Nothing has changed from the beginning to the season to now. We have to do what we do and do it well.”</p>\n<p>The only point of reliability for UCSB this season has been its offense. The Gauchos rank third in the conference in field goal percentage, shooting 40.6 percent. Their three senior guards in Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason average double-figures on a nightly basis.</p>\n<p>Yet this week, the stress in practice is undoubtedly on defense. Not only has the Santa Barbara defense been uncharacteristically inconsistent this season, holding teams to 62.8 points during wins compared to 73.1 points during losses, but Irvine ranks second in the Big West in scoring with 71.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters may not be the tallest team, but they do have a big post presence inside. Irvine will work its offense around senior forward Camille Buckley, who ranks eighth in the conference in scoring with 15.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’ll mix it up,” Mitchell said. “We’ll have to be extremely disciplined, like we were the first half against Fullerton, and we’ll have to probably run two different people at Buckley at times looking to double team her because she’s that good.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Buckley isn’t the only offensive threat. Irvine surrounds Buckley with shooters, including senior guard Jennifer Tsurumoto, who ranks first on the team and fifth in the league in scoring with 16.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Any given night, they have Camille Buckley who has the chance to play at the next level. She’s a big time athlete, but they also have shooters,” Mitchell said. “They’re balanced. Any given night, they can probably beat anyone in the conference.”</p>\n<p>After playing defense, it will be critical for the Gauchos that they secure the rebound, not only to keep Irvine from earning second chance opportunities, but to jumpstart the offense before Irvine can set its zone defense.</p>\n<p>Led by Buckley, who averages 9.4 rebounds per game, Irvine ranks second in the Big West in rebounding, grabbing 41.8 boards per game. UCSB currently ranks last at 34.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“Rebounding is huge,” Mason said. “We only got outrebounded by three [against Fullerton], but it’s when we got outrebounded. It was at critical times and they got momentum off of it because they were knocking down threes.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of January 30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53789\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53789\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-backed-into-a-corner-need-big-west-wins/","id":553,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[552,551,550],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Earn First Conference Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB defeats UC Riverside 74-61 at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It may be early in the season, but the UCSB women’s basketball team could not afford another loss.</p>\n<p>Going into last night’s game against UC Riverside, the Gauchos were 0-3 in the Big West and had lost eight of their last nine.

Riverside, on the other hand, remains the lone winless team in league at 0-5 and 4-14 overall.</p>\n<p>After struggling to start league, averaging just 9.3 points in Santa Barbara’s first three league matches compared to 18.2 points per game during the preseason, senior guard Nicole Nesbit returned to her typical offensive force. She led Santa Barbara with 20 points, six rebounds and four assists with eight of her points coming during a game-deciding 12-0 run for the Gauchos in the second half.</p>\n<p>Zornig also stepped up for UCSB, tallying 16 points, including eight straight points for the Gauchos down the stretch to seal the game.</p>\n<p>However, unlike most games, the Gauchos received offensive production from more than just its seniors. Jasmine ware added 12 points and 11 rebounds, her first career double-double, while junior center Clair Watkins and freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe added eight and seven points, respectively.</p>\n<p>“I’d say it’s about time,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said of Ware’s effort. “I understand the expectations when Jasmine came in here were the same as Clair; everyone thinks it’s supposed to be instant and sometimes it’s a process for kids. We always knew. Jas has great athletic ability and a knack for rebounding. Tonight she stepped up.”</p>\n<p>UCSB outrebounded Riverside 55-30, including 21-6 on the offensive boards, which led to 23 second-chance points. The Gauchos also outscored the Highlanders 34-6 in the paint.</p>\n<p>“In practice we constantly go over rebounding drills over and over, so I think just taking the drills that we do in practice and moving it to the game is what it’s about,” Ware said.</p>\n<p>After missing a multitude of easy layups throughout the first half, Santa Barbara found its offensive stride in the second half. Down 51-50 with just over 17 minutes remaining, Nesbit completed a three point play to spark a 12-0 run for UCSB.

UCSB defeated UC Riverside Thursday in overtime despite giving up a 17-point second half lead before falling Saturday night to Cal State Fullerton in a failed comeback attempt.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara defeated Riverside 68-65 on Thursday and fell to Fullerton 74-72 in a televised game Saturday night, bringing its record to 12-6 overall and 3-2 in the Big West. Saturday’s loss snapped a three-game winning streak for the Gauchos, placing them in a three-way tie for third place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>In a game televised on Fox Sports Prime Ticket, UCSB came out flat on Saturday, trailing by as many as 12 points in the second half. The Gauchos rallied, however, primarily behind the play of junior center Alan Williams. Big Al recorded 16 of his 26 points in the second half, adding along nine rebounds, two steals and two blocks in the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With 2:20 remaining in the contest, UCSB took its first and only lead of the game at 70-68 when Big Al converted a three-point play. Fullerton senior guard Michael Williams then sank a three-pointer with 32 seconds remaining to give the Titans a 71-70 lead.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kyle Boswell’s three-point attempt with 23 seconds remaining raddled in and out twice before bouncing out and into Fullerton’s possession. Santa Barbara was forced to foul and Fullerton made the first of two free throws before missing the second.</p>\n<p>Off the missed free throw, the Gauchos pushed the ball up the court to freshman guard Eric Childress who missed a contested layup with 12 seconds remaining. UCSB was once again forced to foul, leading to two Titan free throws that put the game out of reach for the Gauchos. Fullerton improved to 7-12 overall and 2-3 in the Big West with the victory.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Alex Harris led the Titans with 22 points, while Michael Williams added 19 points, six rebounds and eight assists in a game-high 38 minutes of play. Fullerton shot 45 percent from beyond the arc with Harris and Williams converting four three-point field goals apiece.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 16 points and five rebounds for UCSB, while junior guard Zalmico Harmon tallied eight points and 10 assists without committing a turnover. Boswell added 11 points off the bench, finishing the game 3-7 in three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>While UCSB came out slow in the first half on Saturday, Thursday’s contest against Riverside was the exact opposite. The Gauchos rushed out to an 11-point halftime lead, building that margin to 17 points within the first two minutes of the second half.</p>\n<p>Riverside slowly chipped away at the lead, however, using two separate 8-0 runs to tie the game at 50 with 8:23 remaining in the game. UCSB built a 60-54 lead with just over two minutes remaining, but the Highlanders rallied once again, closing the half on a 6-0 run.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Taylor Johns was fouled with five seconds remaining and his Riverside team trailing 60-59. With a chance to give the Highlanders a late-game lead, Johns made the first free throw but missed the second, avoiding what could have been an epic collapse for UCSB.</p>\n<p>In the overtime period, six of the eight points UCSB scored came by the way of free throws. Bryson scored the final four points of the game for Santa Barbara, an impressive feat considering he had all of one point scored in regulation.</p>\n<p>With a chance to tie the game, Riverside freshman guard Sam Finley missed a three-point jumper with one second remaining to secure the 68-65 win for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Big Al led UCSB with 21 points and seven rebounds, while Harmon and sophomore forward Mitch Brewe added 11 points. Boswell added 10 points off the bench for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Chris Patton led Riverside with 23 points behind an impressive 10-13 night shooting. Finley added 20 points and Johns pitched in with nine points and 11 rebounds for the Highlanders. Including a Saturday victory over Cal Poly, Riverside now holds a 7-13 record and a 2-4 mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces UC Irvine Thursday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January 27, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/","id":551,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[550,549,548],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Fullerton at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs-PETER-VANBELT.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.25.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs-PETER-VANBELT.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB gave up a lead to Fullerton, falling to the Titans at home for the first time since 1991.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Cal State Fullerton guard Chante Miles wasn’t her team’s leading scorer Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>She even finished the game three points below her season average, but in the critical moments, she showed up in a big way.</p>\n<p>Despite taking a 10-point lead into halftime, the UCSB women’s basketball team found itself up just four with a little under eight minutes to go in the second half.

She’s such a great ball handler. There were a couple times we gambled in the backcourt, and she made us pay by attacking and getting to the rim.”</p>\n<p>After UCSB regained the lead, taking a slight 55-52 advantage, Miles converted a layup in transition and earned the foul, completing the three-point play to tie the game with 3:27 remaining.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, Miles drove into the lane and dished the ball to junior forward Kathleen Iwuoha for the layup, giving the Titans a three-point lead.</p>\n<p>Finally, after Santa Barbara missed a jumper to bring the game within one with 24 seconds to go, Miles was fouled and hit the two clutch free throws to ice the game. She finished the afternoon with 11 points and eight assists.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, it’s hard to guard a great player like that one-on-one,” Mitchell said. “That’s not what our defense revolves around, so it was probably the rotation in why she was able to attack and get a couple and-ones.”</p>\n<p>After winning 40 consecutive games against the Titans, UCSB has now dropped the last two. Saturday’s win in the Thunderdome marks the first win in Santa Barbara for Fullerton since 1991 as the Titans improve to 7-11 overall and 3-2 in the Big West. The Gauchos drop to 6-12 overall and 1-4 in conference.</p>\n<p>Once again, UCSB struggled with consistency. After holding the Titans to 23 first half points and 29.2 percent shooting from the field, the Gauchos allowed Fullerton 44 second half points.</p>\n<p>“It’s disappointing because that first half was the style of play we’ve been waiting on the defensive side of things,” Mitchell said. “The game of basketball is two halves, and they made us pay for all of our mistakes in the second half.”</p>\n<p>Five players finished in double-figures for the Titans, and the team hit an incredible 10 shots from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“When you’re making threes and everybody’s feeling it, you get in a certain type of rhythm,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “It gathers momentum for the team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also featured three players in double-figures with senior guard Melissa Zornig leading the Gaucho offense with 20 points. Mason added 18 points and a team-high eight rebounds while Onome Jemerigbe added a career-high 11 points.</p>\n<p>The loss concludes a three-game homestand for Santa Barbara. Next week, the Gauchos go on road, facing UC Irvine and UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January27, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53705\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53705\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-fullerton-at-home/","id":552,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[551,550,549],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
