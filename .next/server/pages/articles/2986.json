Will Tran/<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>Career Services held the first day of its Fall Career Fair yesterday at Corwin Pavilion, with a second day open only to science, technology and engineering students, open today.</p>\n<p>The fair, which happens every quarter, features a slew of national companies such as Yelp, Target, Microsoft, SolarCity and Oracle, along with local companies such as Raytheon and AppFolio. Although the event is free for all students, alumni are welcome with a nominal fee paid two days in advance.</p>\n<p>According to Career Services counselor Molly Steen, the fair usually attracts a turnout of about 600 to 800 students.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good number of students that come through and take advantage of this,” Steen said.</p>\n<p>Annie Phung, a fourth-year communication major and member of business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi, one of the fair sponsors, said her organization has been busy trying to promote the event by passing out flyers, posters and making announcements. She said the fair is a good opportunity not only to come into contact with potential employers, but to gain employment-seeking skills.</p>\n<p>“You just come and talk to people,” Phung said. “It is also good practice for them to look professional; to communicate on a casual, yet professional level with employers face-to-face.”</p>\n<p>Carolina Feria, a fourth-year sociology and Spanish double major and member of Teach for America, said she is excited be on the other side of job hunt, helping students get career experience.</p>\n<p>“There is so much potential in all these students, and the fact that I was on the other side last year and I’m helping them now is so amazing,” Feria said. “You can tell the difference between somebody who takes the initiative to bring a resume, somebody who takes the initiative to have everything clean and somebody who takes the initiative to really stand out is really great.”</p>\n<p>Alumna Kristie Reynolds, who represented Macy’s, said there are certain steps students can do to improve their chances of landing a job.</p>\n<p>“Be prepared,” Reynolds said. “Definitely look up all the companies that are going to be at the career fair that you’re interested in. I think you need to know what positions that they have available … and know what you want to go into and be prepared with the experience that you have and how to sell yourself at the career fair.”</p>\n<p>Electrical engineering major Daren Jing said he focused on writing a good resume to get an internship for electrical or computer engineering. He said the career fair makes the job search easily accessible for all students.</p>\n<p>“This [is] good because I can talk to those people, those employees and learn more about their company,” Jing said. “I don’t need to go online and search [for] each company. It takes a lot of time, but here, I can talk to each [person] and hand out my resume.”</p>\n<p>Reynolds said students will learn about the career options they’ll have during and after college.</p>\n<p>“I hope that they’ll get good experience in learning how to network and find out what’s out there for them and how UCSB can really help them develop their careers after college,” she said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 14 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57286\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57286\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/","id":2986,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[2985,2984,2983],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes","biography":"Not available","articles":[2927,2937,2952,2965,2969,2986,2994,3437,3460,4803],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Will Tran/<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met last night to discuss new amendments and bills regarding the recording of Senate meetings, the upcoming Student of Color Conference and capabilities to remove A.S. staff.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau began the discussion by addressing the current bills in question and moved the conversation to Senate member inquiries before allowing time for public forum.</p>\n<p>Diane O’Brien, executive assistant to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, gave an update prior to public forum about an ongoing housing shortage for international students.</p>\n<p>“We’re currently trying to work with them to find out how many have and don’t have housing at the moment,” O’Brien said. “What I’ve been told is that, for whatever reason, the housing market has been impacted and that it was an unexpected thing. The school isn’t overenrolled, the students are just having difficulty finding housing.”</p>\n<p>After public forum, a motion was introduced to permit the videotaping of Senate meetings in order to have them available for public viewing. The motion was voted on and then sent to the Constitution and Bylaws Committee for further consideration.</p>\n<p>Diversity Educator for the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) Kyron Covington requested Senate funding for the upcoming Student of Color Conference, to take place on Nov. 7 to 9 at UC Merced. Covington said the conference was a chance for students of color to discuss issues relevant to “color culture” and their specific universities.</p>\n<p>“It is a chance to celebrate students of color culture and talk about issues that they can bring back to their respective campuses,” Covington said.</p>\n<p>Senator Liam Stanton also requested A.S. President Ali Guthy to fund the Student of Color Conference with presidential funds. Guthy said an examination of the budget was necessary before any funds could be appropriated.</p>\n<p>Third-year literature major and former Student Advocate General Bailey Loverin also sponsored an update to A.S. Legal Code Article VII Sections 3 and 8-10, with the intent of preventing what she alleged was the unjust removal of A.S. staff.</p>\n<p>“[The bill] does not allow executives to remove appointed officers without consent of the Senate,” Loverin said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marcela Marquez brought up issues of student health and the possibility of establishing “peace zones” in the school to aid students dealing with various stages of post-traumatic stress.</p>\n<p>“The administration and the Chancellor are working together to develop peaceful areas in the school for students to be able to relax,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>Senate questions were addressed towards the end of the meeting, with Lau encouraging Senators to spread news of the upcoming special A.S. Election for Student Advocate General and External Vice President of Local Affairs in order to gain results reflective of the entire student body.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The two positions were vacated in early September by the resignations of former EVPLA, fourth-year sociology and Asian American studies double major Beatrice Contreras, and former SAG and third-year literature major Bailey Loverin.</p>\n<p>To be eligible for EVPLA or Student Advocate General requires the completion of at least 60 units accredited at UCSB by the end of Spring Quarter prior to the special election, including college-level transfer units, but excluding Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate units. Eligibility also requires fulfillment of at least six units while maintaining a 2.0 overall grade point average. An information session for interested individuals will be held at the A.S. Pardall Center today from 12-1 p.m. on Pardall Road in Isla Vista. Deadline candidacy forms were also made available online yesterday.</p>\n<p>Proposed plebiscites, new fees, referendums or fee increases can be submitted to the “fee intent form” found on the elections website and sent to elections@as.ucsb.edu by tomorrow, Oct. 15, at 4 p.m. In addition, pro/con statements will be due to the Elections Committee by Oct. 22 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>Active campaigning for the Special Election will start Oct. 26 at 8 p.m. According to the announcement, the timeline is more condensed than that of the last year’s Spring general election and “diligence” with regard to deadlines and dates is mandated by the elections committee.

Schunk’s platform focuses on I.V. self-<br> governance and student advocacy through community members, business owners and long-term residents. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Associated Students held a forum at the Arbor on Wednesday for the position of A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, a fourth-year psychology and political science double major, is running unopposed to fill the void previously left by fourth-year sociology and Asian American studies major Beatrice Contreras. The forum was held yesterday afternoon in the Arbor to inform students about Schunk’s platform and goals for the future if elected.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology and Chicano Studies double-major Gerardo Gonzalez, a general member of the elections committee, said no one outside of A.S. asked questions.</p>\n<p>“Questions were centered around his position as a EVPLA, what he was working to accomplish, his thoughts and his experience he’s had with Associated Students and the EVPLA office in Isla Vista,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>According to Cameron, his platform focuses primarily on providing student advocacy and self-governance for the residents of I.V., and there is no one entity responsible for everyone living in I.V.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day we are represented by one of five supervisors on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors,” Schunk said. “Of that one person, we’re only 20 percent of her voter block. We’re not her priority and that’s not because she’s a bad person, it’s because she doesn’t have the resources to dedicate to us effectively. If we have the resources ourselves, we would be able to do it just fine.“</p>\n<p>A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Molly Morrison said Schunk’s platform resonated with her and that he demonstrated concern for the future of I.V., a concern she found lacking in many other students.</p>\n<p>“Most students here, because they are so transient, don’t seem to care about the future of UCSB, SBCC students and Isla Vista long-term residents,” Morrison said. “I think his platform for self-governance and overall for culture improvement really speaks to me. If we don’t have anyone to speak for us right now, then who will speak for us in the future?”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, another primary goal of his is to create an “I Support Isla Vista” campaign for community members, business owners, and long-term residents to catalyze advocacy and community interest in I.V.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I’ve noticed in Isla Vista is whenever I attend a county board meeting, it is largely long-term residents that are there. It is because students aren’t aware that those things are happening,” Schunk said. “If we don’t speak, no one will hear us.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he also hopes to have A.S., and eventually the university, provide outreach by providing bilingual publications and announcements.</p>\n<p>“I want A.S. and especially the entire student body to take accountability for the impacts we make on the Isla Vista community,” Schunk said. “Just because you love something, doesn’t mean you always take care of it, even when it needs to be taken care of.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, October 30, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57650\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57650\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/a-s-holds-evpla-candidate-panel/","id":2985,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2984,2983,2982],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
