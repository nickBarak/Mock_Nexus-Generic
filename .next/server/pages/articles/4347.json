UC Irvine currently paces the league in overall wins, but is tied with Cal State Fullerton in conference at 13-5.</p>\n<p>Among conference leaders, the Irvine staff holds a well-rounded group as players top Big West leaderboards across categories. Junior right-handed pitcher Matt Esparza has eight wins under his belt going in to this weekend, placing him tied for first overall in Big West wins. Esparza currently maintains the conference’s 17th-best ERA at 3.35.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Irvine is also home to conference RBI leader, freshman infielder Keston Hiura. Hiura has hit for 50 RBI this season and holds a .338 batting average. Junior infielder Mikey Duarte holds the third-best batting average in the Big West at .362. UC Irvine leads the Big West in total home runs smacking 26 this season.</p>\n<p>Alongside the Anteaters, Gaucho players also span the conference leaderboard this late in the season. Senior outfielder Cameron Newell still holds the best batting average in the Big West as he hits for .384.</p>\n<p>Defensively, all four UCSB starters have maintained a top ten conference ERA. Junior righty Dillon Tate leads the charge at No. 2 with a 1.73 ERA, just barely trailing the conference leader, freshman righty Chis Mathewson at 1.72.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Shane Bieber follows at No. 6 with a 2.08 ERA, and junior lefty Justin Jacome comes in at No. 8 with a 2.47 ERA. Junior righty Domenic Mazza comes in at No. 9 with a 2.61 ERA. The UCSB pitching staff is now No. 3 in NCAA ERA rankings.</p>\n<p>The UCSB lineup has consistently topped the league in collective batting average as it ranks No. 1 for yet another week. The Gauchos are now hitting .293 and have raked in a .375 on-base percentage. Irvine, on the other hand is hitting .281 with a .363 OBP.</p>\n<p>Last year, Irvine swept the Gauchos in a three-game series on Anteater turf. Both Jacome and Bieber started in a game during that series last year and both were recorded as the losing pitchers. Tate also appeared as a closer to record an out.</p>\n<p>The series begins Friday at 3 p.m. with the regular season home finale set for Sunday at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article

id=\"caption-attachment-80577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Public Health Department warns that water in several areas may still be contaminated with bacteria.<br>Residents should avoid closed areas of coastline and thoroughly cook recreationally caught seafood. <em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The various coliforms and bacteria measured have remained at staggering levels above state standards. As of Monday, Goleta Beach has fecal coliform levels that are 150 percent over state standards and enterococcus levels at over 10,000 percent. Fecal coliform and enterococcus are types of bacteria.</p>\n<p>While eight beaches were closed initially, only Carpinteria State Beach, Goleta Beach and Hammond’s Beach remain closed.</p>\n<p>The Public Health Department warns against going into affected waters, citing high levels of bacteria which could indicate that other disease-causing bacteria are present.</p>\n<p>The department will continue to conduct testing on Goleta Beach and other areas, but for now it recommends remaining 400 feet away from beach areas where mud transports are temporarily deposited. The buffer zone is marked by orange fencing.</p>\n<p>Elevated levels of bacteria in ocean water were first seen after Santa Barbara County began moving mud from Highway 101 to local beaches.</p>\n<p>Mud and soil runoff from the storms following the Thomas Fire in early December were collected and then transported by county flood control officials to make room for road repairs. Goleta Beach was selected as a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/mud-from-landslides-moved-to-goleta-beach-tested-for-safety/\">temporary storage site</a> for this policy.</p>\n<p>The mud dumping largely contributed to the rise in contaminant levels along surrounding areas due to the “unknown amounts of untreated sewage and possible chemical contaminants in the water and sand,” said Susan Klein-Rothschild, deputy director of Santa Barbara’s Public Health Department.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Public Health Department issued a release warning the public to “refrain from eating recreationally raw fish and shellfish where levels of bacteria highly exceed standards.” Individuals should cook “recreationally caught” seafood before consuming it, the department said in the release.</p>\n<p>Goleta Beach is one of the areas cited in the release.</p>\n<p>Campus Point remains open due to acceptable water conditions, county officials said, as coliform levels are stable and only enterococcus bacteria exists in the water. These conditions, however, could fluctuate for as long as mud is being brought to Goleta Beach.</p>\n<p>“Bacteria concentrations at Campus Point will likely be a function of currents and winds that bring the sediment plume from Goleta Beach to Campus Point,” explained Jenna Driscoll, an associate for Santa Barbara Channelkeeper.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Channelkeeper is conducting water soil tests for <em>E.Coli</em>, fecal coliform and other biological contaminants that could seriously affect beachgoers at these locations.</p>\n<p>The Public Health Department is also testing the water. Updated data can be found on the Public Health Department and SBCK websites.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the Feb. 1 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Jenna Driscoll’s name was mistakingly written as “Jenny,” due to an editing error. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80738\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80738\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/","id":4344,"author":{"id":224,"name":"Spencer Sween"},"related":[4343,4342,4341],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Weekly Goings-On in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2018-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-7.41.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-7.41.13-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On Tuesday, Feb. 13, The Women’s Center is hosting a guided art class and an evening of self-care from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. in the UCSB SRB Multipurpose Room.
