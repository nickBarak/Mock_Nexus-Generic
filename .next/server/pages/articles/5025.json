Hawaii was not to be denied, however, and a burst of scoring gave them an 11-6 advantage that would prove insurmountable for the Gauchos, who couldn’t manage to cut the deficit under three for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Beginning a match-long trend, the Rainbow Wahine bested UCSB in hitting percentage .303 to .091 in the first frame. Remarkably, that was the lowest percentage Hawaii would hit for the entire match, as they improved above .400 for the next two sets.</p>\n<p>Hawaii provided another gut punch in the second set, as a dominant performance coupled with a sloppy UCSB showing (eight errors) led the Rainbow Wahine to their most decisive victory of the three games, 25-14.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s hitting percentage actually dropped to .000 while the Wahine jumped to .407, accurately portraying the chasm between the two teams’ second-set performances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to put forth a strong final set, however, finally raising their hitting percentage to a serviceable .241 and amassing double-digit kills (13).</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s vastly improved effort, the 14th-ranked Hawaii squad improved for the third consecutive game, playing a virtually perfect final set on their way to a 25-19 victory.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine boasted a hitting percentage of .448, committed only one error, and each time the Gauchos clawed their way back into contention, Hawaii was poised with a run of its own.</p>\n<p>This impressive Hawaii team refined its attack throughout the evening, asserting itself again as the Big West’s goliath.</p>\n<p>They received important contributions from across the roster, with senior opposite hitter Nikki Taylor, sophomore outside hitter McKenna Granato, sophomore outside hitter Casey Castillo and reserve senior middle hitter Annie Mitchem leading the team’s offensive wave.</p>\n<p>Each of the four totaled at least seven kills, with Granato leading the pack with 13. Granato and her teammate Castillo hit a resounding .478 and .667 respectively, marking the efficiency with which the Wahine attacked the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>McKenna Granato also collected seven digs, second on the team to first-year setter Norene Iosia (8), adding to her solid all-around performance. Nikki Taylor had four assisted blocks to go along with one solo, further contributing to Hawaii’s stellar defense.</p>\n<p>Despite the disappointing output, several Gauchos still maintained a high level of play.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Chanel Hoffman amassed 10 kills, and despite her hitting percentage of .200, she was the only Gaucho with double-digit points in the match.</p>\n<p>Coach Lantagne Welch saw several positives throughout the evening that should help the team during the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p>“Chloe Allen came off the bench, followed the game plan and went after it. She had success and that was a boost for us,” Coach Lantagne Welch noted of her first-year outside hitter.</p>\n<p>Allen has settled into her role off the bench, garnering the respect of her team and providing the Gauchos with verve in reserve heavy units.</p>\n<p>During the final game, Lantagne Welch was impressed with another first-year, middle blocker Rowan Ennis: “[She] got hot there for a stretch and helped us in the third set.” Ennis’ three kills in the set were vital in keeping the Gauchos within reach of a victory in the final game.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore and defensive specialist Sydney Bast also caught her coach’s eye, as she “helped stabilize [UCSB’s] passing,” while digging a team-high nine attacks.</p>\n<p>When Bast was asked after the game what about the Hawaii team had stumped the Gauchos, she noted, “they have a fast offense and we knew it coming into this game. We prepared for it all week, we just didn’t execute like we wanted to.”</p>\n<p>She made sure to mention, though, the team’s consistently positive outlook: “It’s all good. We’re going to get them back at Hawaii.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look for its first conference win against Cal State Northridge on Friday, Sept. 30 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-26/ucsb-swept-3-0-in-conference-opener/","id":5025,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5024,5023,5022],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey","biography":"Not available","articles":[41,43,44,1175,1180,1181,1182,1185,1186,1211,1917,3309,3313,3319,3320,4184,4993,4995,4998,4999,5000,5001,5002,5003,5018,5019,5025,5363,5397,5398,5411,5413,5415,5416,5432,5433,5434,5435,5452],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Confident in Extending Their Success on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_Eric_Swenson_005-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_Eric_Swenson_005-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"With just six matches remaining this season, the No. 6 UCSB men's water polo looks to solidify its chances in the MPSF standings against San Jose State and No. 5 Standford.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Despite losing eight of its last nine matches, San Jose State’s denial to concede to defeat makes the team a challenging competitor. Key players for the Spartans include freshman driver Justin Contreras and sophomore two-meter defender Igor Miljan. The young players are the leading scorers for SJSU, with 19 goals and 18 goals respectively. One possible reason for the Spartans’ troubles this season is their lack of experience. SJSU is currently the only MPSF team that has no senior on its roster.</p>\n<p>A big breakout player to keep an eye on this weekend for the Gauchos is Derek Shoemaker. The senior attacker became the leading goal scorer for UCSB with 28 goals. He had a great weekend in which he set a new career high for himself with four goals in one game against LBSU. However, Shoemaker is more than just a scorer. He is also the team leader in field blocks with 11, third in assists with 11 and fifth in steals with 14.</p>\n<p>“I like to bring everything to the team,” Shoemaker states. “I’m not trying to score all the goals — me and my teammates just want to stay aggressive. We have a bunch of great players on this team. I just like to do anything I can.”</p>\n<p>However, the number one weapon for the Gauchos continues to be senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge, the MPSF leader in saves per game with 10.7. UCSB is a team that continually preaches great defense and proved it last weekend, holding the No. 2 Trojans to their second lowest scoring total of the season by surrendering just six points. The senior played a big role not only in that game but in every game as he continues to prove he is one of the best goalkeepers in MPSF history.</p>\n<p>The senior goalkeeper will need to play especially well when the team travels to face Stanford and the MPSF leader in goals scored Bret Bonanni. The senior has scored 58 goals this year and is also the only player in MPSF history to have two 90-goal seasons. The 2014 FINA Men’s Water Polo Player of the Year is also eight goals away from becoming the leading scorer in MPSF history.</p>\n<p>“We know who he is,” Wigo said. “And we are going to be aware of where he is at all times. In a way it makes it easier, since we know who to focus on, but it will still be tough.”</p>\n<p>Stanford’s other key offensive weapon is Adam Abdulhamid. The redshirt junior driver is second on the team with 45 goals scored. The Cardinals’ staggering offense has scored an astonishing 303 goals this season. The last time these two teams met was one year ago in which Stanford won 13-6.</p>\n<p>While not facing a must-win situation, victories this weekend could be a substantial jump for the Gauchos becoming a true contender in MPSF play. Although both matches are away, UCSB is unbeaten on the road with a 2-0 record.</p>\n<p>“We feel good about these games,” Shoemaker said. “Obviously we love to play at home but we are going to go in there and play the same way.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not a big concern to us,” Wigo added. “We won’t have our big home crowd, but it’s not like we are going into the Roman Colosseum — we just have to focus on what we are doing and we will be okay.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s bout at San Jose State will begin at 2 p.m. on Friday, then Santa Barbara will travel to Stanford to play the Cardinals at 12 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 24th.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Gauchos were finally able to do something this weekend that they hadn’t been able to do in almost two years — celebrate a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) win. This came after a big 10-7 win at No. 8 LBSU. However, No. 6 UCSB’s celebration was cut short as the next day No. 2 USC came into Santa Barbara and beat the Gauchos 6-5 in a game that was wildly intense on all fronts.</p>\n<p>The split puts the Gauchos at a very respectable 12-7 record and 1-3 in conference play while LBSU drops to 7-10 on the season and are still in search of a conference win with a 0-3 record. The big gut-check win for USC improves their record to 17-2 overall and helps keep their perfect MPSF start, as they are now 5-0.</p>\n<p>The match against USC was an absolute must-watch. The crowd was so vibrant, really cheering on the Gauchos as they tried to pull off the upset. The coaches were out of their seats most of the game, coaching their players up on the fly. And the players themselves showed nothing but heart. This game truly encompassed the greatness of water polo.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It was amazing,” senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge said. “We have the best crowd in MPSF; we proved that today and honestly the atmosphere was just amazing.”</p>\n<p>The high intensity began right when that whistle for the match blew. The first few possessions for both teams ended in poor shots, not because of bad offense but because of great defense, something that Head Coach Wolf Wigo really preaches to his players.</p>\n<p>“Defense is definitely an emphasis.” Wigo said. “A great defense is what generates a good offense and our defense on front court was amazing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB broke the ice about halfway through with sophomore Shane Hauschild throwing a beautiful pass to freshman Boris Jovanovic in the corner for an easy goal. The first quarter ended with UCSB up 2-1.</p>\n<p>The Trojans would not let the Gauchos hold its lead for long. After a steal, sophomore Matteo Morelli threw a pass the length of the pool to sophomore Lachlan Edwards who converted the goal. USC then scored three seconds before the end of the half, taking a 3-2 lead. Both teams traded goals in the third to make the score 4-3 after three.</p>\n<p>The final frame is where this game had just a slew of emotion. It started with the impressive defense from both teams until junior Blake Edwards took over. The second-best goal scorer in the MPSF scored two goals, the latter coming with just over two minutes left that seemed to doom Santa Barbara. It put them in a familiar situation that they were in just a couple weeks ago in their first week of conference play — scoreless fourth periods. However, this team was ready to right the wrong of those first two games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began their attack when Jovanovic made a goal from the corner as the shot clock was expiring. This made the score 6-4 in favor of USC. After stellar defense, the Gauchos scored again, this time courtesy of junior Mitchell Hamilton. With just over a minute left, the Gauchos closed the lead to one. Again, good defense led to the Gauchos getting one final look to tie the game and send it to OT. The final shot was one that the Gauchos made twice earlier in the match, Jovanovic from the corner. Unfortunately this time it did not work as it clipped the goalpost and went out of bounds. The Trojans ran the rest of the clock and it was over.</p>\n<p>“It was a pretty good look,” Wigo said. “It was a shot we saw earlier in the game, it was there; unfortunately it didn’t go in.”</p>\n<p>The loss is one that will stick with the Gauchos as they continue on their crusade of MPSF games. After a heartbreaker like that, teams can either fall apart or be motivated to work harder. UCSB seems to want to be the latter.</p>\n<p>“It sucks and hurts, but if anything, this will help us,” Hauschild said. “We are there, we are competing with these top teams, we just have to convert those opportunities that make the difference.”</p>\n<p>Before the tough gut-wrenching loss, the Gauchos were finally able to celebrate a MPSF win. Led by senior Derek Shoemaker and his four goals, the Gauchos were able to go into LBSU’s pool and get a victory.</p>\n<p>“We knew it was going to be a tough game,” Whitelegge said. “We started off a bit sluggish but we got the win — that’s what matters.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did in fact start out sluggish, falling behind 2-0 early on before grinding their way back to tie the game at 2-2. They fell behind again 4-2 midway through the second. Again Santa Barbara got back into the game, tying it up and making the halftime score 4-4.</p>\n<p>The third frame is where UCSB took off. The Gauchos outscored LBSU 5-1, two courtesy of Shoemaker, and took a commanding four-point lead into the final period where they were able to hold on and get their first MPSF win of the season.</p>\n<p>“It was a strong win,” Wigo said. “This is now our fourth time beating them this season. I don’t think we’ve ever done that, it was great.”</p>\n<p>This weekend certainly was telling of the Gauchos. It told fans that they are not only resilient, but unwavered by whoever it is they play. To break a losing streak against a rival team at their place is nothing short of great. And to then go back home and play an amazing match against the second-best team in the nation with absolutely no “hangover” from their emotional win the night before is also noteworthy. Although their MPSF record might not show it just yet, UCSB still has a chance to do great things in conference play if they can keep that intensity.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ next match is Friday against San Jose State at their pool at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Santa Barbara, the No. 6 seed in the invitational, will face off against the No. 11 seed, UC San Diego, in its first-round matchup Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are looking to regain some confidence after losses to two great teams, California and Pacific. The defeats set them back to a 9-4 overall record and started them off with a 0-2 record in conference play for the second straight year.</p>\n<p>“We are definitely trying to move forward,” senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge said. “Overall I think we are doing good, just looking to keep on making positive strides.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara also wants to improve upon its disappointing eighth place finish in this same invitational last year. UCSB started strong, beating Pepperdine in its first-round matchup, but lost its final three matches of the tournament.</p>\n<p>“We want to be able to compete against these top teams that’s the goal,” Whitelegge said. “These are the games you really have to fine tune what you’re doing.”</p>\n<p>The Tritons have an overall record of 6-7 and are 1-0 in WWPA conference play. They are coming off an embarrassing 17-8 loss to UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“They are a crafty team,” senior attacker Derek Shoemaker said. “They are always very tough to guard, we won’t take them lightly.”</p>\n<p>Key players for the Tritons are senior utility Chase Cockerill and junior driver Nick Alexander. Cockerill has scored a team high 23 goals this season. The two-time WWPA all-academic player has also registered 28 steals, another team high.</p>\n<p>Alexander, a 2014 WWPA all-academic recipient, has scored his fair share of goals with 17 on the season and is the leading assist man for UCSD with 26.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met was one year ago in this very same tournament. The Tritons were the victors in that third-round matchup with an impressive 9-4 win and finished sixth overall.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to get any type of revenge it will need perfomances from its top players. Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge has been a dominant force for the defense averaging 10.2 saves per game. On the offensive side, sophomore attacker and 2014 MPSF Freshman of the Year Shane Hauschild will look to add to his team high of 21 goals with help from senior attacker Derek Shoemaker and his 18 goals.</p>\n<p>Another player to watch out for is freshman driver Borislav Jovanovic. The young Serbian driver is third in goals scored for UCSB with 16 and scored an impressive two goals against California on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“On offense we need to be less selfish and play a little smarter.” Shoemaker said. “We take pride on having a lot of guys that can shoot and score. We don’t have two guys that score five goals we have five guys that can each score two and that is just much harder to guard.”</p>\n<p>One big question mark for Santa Barbara will be how it bounces back from two back-to-back scoreless fourth quarters. A big contributing factor in those scoreless fourth quarters was fatigue.</p>\n<p>The big drop in intensity is something that must be addressed if the Gauchos want to come out of this tournament victorious. Fans will have to see if the Gauchos’ intensity can last for all four periods of their four matches this weekend.</p>\n<p>“We want to be able to play four quarters as opposed to three.” Whitelegge said. “The problem was not being out of shape, the game was tough and we just lost momentum.
