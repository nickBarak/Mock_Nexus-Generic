In addition, they were able to hand Fullerton its first loss in league play. The Titans move to 31-5 overall and 8-1 in conference play, maintaining hold of first place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>On Friday, the Gauchos played a night game on the road, but did not seem to skip a beat from their previous few games as they again jumped ahead to an early lead 1-0 in the first inning. Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell extended his hitting streak right away with a single into right center. Junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon singled with one out to move Newell to third, who then proceeded to score on freshman designated hitter Robby Nesovic’s groundout.</p>\n<p>Bats then went quiet in the game as both starting pitchers were on top of their games. Sophomore pitcher Austin Pettibone pitched seven and two thirds innings and allowed just two runs on 11 hits while striking out three. On the other side for the Titans, freshman Thomas Eshelman topped Pettibone with eight innings of work, just one earned run and seven strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Neither starter factored in the decision as the game was decided on a blown save and a loss by the Gaucho bullpen, allowing two runs in the bottom of the ninth. The Gauchos put up two runs in the top of the ninth to take a 3-2 lead, but a leadoff bunt in the bottom of the ninth began the trouble for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The bullpen then crumbled as two walks by freshman closer Dylan Hecht loaded the bases. He was replaced by senior reliever Jared Wilson who came in and threw a wild pitch to allow one run before a sac fly ended the game 4-3.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Fullerton came out and roughed up any Gaucho pitcher to take the mound. Freshman starting pitcher Justin Jacome got through just three innings after he allowed six runs on eight hits.</p>\n<p>He was relieved by freshman Hector Lujan, who was also touched up for three runs in just an inning and a third. Freshman pitcher Domenic Mazza then came in to stop the offensive explosion and gave up just one run in his three and two thirds innings.</p>\n<p>Freshman Justin Garza of the Titans earned his seventh win of the season and is still without a loss on the year after his seven inning, nine strikeout performance.</p>\n<p>Game three was a flipped script after the previous day’s drubbing. Nesovic pitched six and two thirds innings of shutout ball. He allowed just four hits and struck out two but walked four en route to his first win of the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ two runs would prove to be enough, as the Titans could not muster any offense. Newell saw his hit streak come to an end on Sunday after 12 straight games while Woody Woodward pushed his up to eight games over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Up next for Santa Barbara will be a one-game trip to San Diego on Tuesday evening. First pitch is set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/gauchos-drop-series-to-no-4-fullerton/","id":4481,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4480,4479,4478],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Look to Make Statement","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8296.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Baseball_MarkBrocher_02.22.2013_DSC_8296.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB baseball team is headed into perhaps the biggest series of the year this weekend.

Freshman pitcher Thomas Eshelman has dominated this season for the Titans. He currently holds a 1.09 ERA, a .158 opponent batting average and has thrown the most innings of any Big West pitcher.</p>\n<p>The Titans also know how to close out games as they lead the league in saves thanks to junior outfielder/pitcher Michael Lorenzen, who has closed out 12 games to go along with his seven home runs and 35 RBI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to continue the hot hitting they have displayed over the last week. Having shown they can score early and late in the game, the Gauchos are in no shortage of confidence heading into the weekend.</p>\n<p>“Being able to put up some runs early and late is a big deal,” Trinkwon said. “It lets us know that if we do put up some runs early and happen to lose a lead that it’s not over and we can come back. I’m sure it will be tough to hold [Fullerton] to very little runs, so it will be a good thing that we can score later.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell will ride a 10-game hitting streak into Fullerton. He has scored a run in eight games over the streak, and half of the games have been multi-hit contests for the Gauchos’ leadoff hitter. Sophomore Woody Woodward, the Gauchos’ No. 2 hitter, has a five-game hitting streak in which he has scored five runs and driven in three. Woodward just missed hitting for the cycle on April 6 when he had a four-hit game against Cal Poly, needing a home run to complete the feat.</p>\n<p>On the mound for the Gauchos on Friday will be sophomore starter Austin Pettibone. Pettibone leads the team with 56.2 innings pitched as he has anchored the staff. He leads UCSB starters with a 2.86 ERA and is tied for the team lead with four wins.</p>\n<p>“It all starts on the mound and I have all the faith in the world in Austin Pettibone. He should go out and give us six or seven innings in his start and pound the strike zone and put pressure on them,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “I suspect guys throwing under the lights, where it’s a little harder to score, to have the run totals a little lower.”</p>\n<p>Despite both teams toting top notch pitching staffs, evident by both teams being top four in ERA, opponent average and total runs allowed, the top three run producers in the Big West will be facing off in this series. Numbers one and two come from Cal State Fullerton in Lorenzen and sophomore infielder J.D. Davis and number three is Santa Barbara’s sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>“The bats are great, but the arms are great too, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s 8-7 but I also wouldn’t be surprised if its 2-1,” Trinkwon said. “There are just so many good players playing in one weekend so it’s tough to tell.”</p>\n<p>The big weekend kicks off Friday at 7 p.m. followed by another night game Saturday at 6 p.m. The series will conclude Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m., at which point one team will come away as a major force in the Big West conference.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 11th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/gauchos-look-to-make-statement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/gauchos-look-to-make-statement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/gauchos-look-to-make-statement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/gauchos-look-to-make-statement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/gauchos-look-to-make-statement/","id":4478,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4477,4476,4475],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look For Revenge at Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Today, the UCSB baseball team heads to Malibu to take on Pepperdine University in a rematch of last Tuesday’s showdown where the Waves escaped with a 3-1 victory.

The Gauchos are coming off a loss in their latest game Sunday, but took two out of three in the series against rival Cal Poly over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“We have a chance to get some revenge,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “Last time they got us pretty good here. I think we’re swinging the bats better than we were the last time they saw us. So hopefully that will show up [today] and it will turn into more offense when we play [Pepperdine].”</p>\n<p>This time around Pepperdine will host the Gauchos as the two swap spots just one week after their first meeting. The Waves are in the final game of a four-game home stand today with the Gauchos after they took two out of three games against the University of Washington. Pepperdine is now 18-12 and 6-3 in the West Coast Conference, making them the top team in the league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Junior starting pitcher Corey Miller earned himself WCC Player of the Week last week in his performance against Washington. Miller pitched 10 scoreless innings, struck out 10 and did not walk a single opposing batter. He, however, did not earn the win as the game was not decided until the 11th inning.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos, they remain in the middle of the back in the Big West conference. At 16-14 and 3-3 in the Big West, they remain tied in the standings with three other teams for fourth place.</p>\n<p>However, the last series showed promise for the Gauchos. Cal Poly is currently 4-2 in league play but the two losses came against the Gauchos, one defeat coming in a 13-2 drubbing on Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>In the previous meeting last week, Pepperdine scored early and often, but after the fourth inning there was near silence as the pitchers for both sides got into ruts. The Waves scored on just the second at bat after a leadoff double by freshman second baseman Hutton Moyer set the table and later came in on an error.</p>\n<p>Leading off the second inning, the Waves’ junior left fielder Chris Amezquita homered to take a 2-0 lead. The Gauchos managed a run in the bottom of the third, but the Waves answered back in the top of the fourth before the Gaucho bullpen pitched five scoreless innings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ bats will look to stay hot, coming off a strong offensive weekend. Santa Barbara outscored Cal Poly 23-11 over the course of three games.</p>\n<p>Sophomore center fielder Cameron Newell, currently one of the hottest hitters in any lineup, has now hit safely in nine straight games dating back to March 24 at Cal Poly. Of the nine games, four were multi-hit showings and he has scored eight runs and driven in six over that span.</p>\n<p>Sophomore second baseman Woody Woodward is working on his own modest four-game hitting streak dating back to the first game against Pepperdine. Over the course of the streak, he has hit .529 with a big 4-5 game on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Today’s game is set to take place at 3 p.m. at Eddy D. Field Stadium in Malibu.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 9, 2013’s print edition of the </em><em>Nexus.</em><br>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baseball_markbrocher_4.5.2013_DSC_2114.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"920888817\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50730\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50731\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/gauchos-look-for-revenge-at-pepperdine/baseball_markbrocher_4-5-2013_dsc_2114/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baseball_markbrocher_4.5.2013_DSC_2114.jpg?fit=4800%2C3200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4800,3200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1365175328\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"baseball_markbrocher_4.5.2013_DSC_2114\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baseball_markbrocher_4.5.2013_DSC_2114.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baseball_markbrocher_4.5.2013_DSC_2114.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50731\" alt=\"baseball_markbrocher_4.5.2013_DSC_2114\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baseball_markbrocher_4.5.2013_DSC_2114-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/gauchos-look-for-revenge-at-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/gauchos-look-for-revenge-at-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/gauchos-look-for-revenge-at-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/gauchos-look-for-revenge-at-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/gauchos-look-for-revenge-at-pepperdine/","id":4479,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4478,4477,4476],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No on F Leaves CSD Fundless","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-10-at-4.27.44-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-10-at-4.27.44-PM.png?resize=921%2C614&ssl=1","description":"Measures E and F experienced differing fates Tuesday night.

The CSD has the power to improve infrastructure, institute community policing, mediate between tenants and landlords and run the community center, among other services.</p>\n<p>The failure of Measure F, however, took away the CSD’s ability to levy a utility user tax (UUT) — an 8 percent tax on the utilities of I.V. residents — meant to be the primary source of funding for the local body.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens now?</strong><br>\nYes on E&amp;F organizers have not written off Measure F just yet. There are still 1,349 provisional ballots to be counted Thursday, and proponents are hopeful that these ballots may swing the vote.</p>\n<p>Should Measure F still not pass, however, the future of the CSD could prove to be trivial.</p>\n<p>According to Darcél Elliott, Yes on E&amp;F campaign manager, monthly CSD board meetings could turn into a community space for residents to discuss issues at hand, but “they just wouldn’t be able to do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>“This has been the problem in Isla Vista for a long time. We have the ability to talk about things but not the ability to do anything about it,” she said.</p>\n<p>As for ways to obtain funds, newly elected CSD board member Jay Freeman said it will be difficult to obtain enough money “to pay for anything important.”</p>\n<p>The CSD board of directors could start a crowdfunding campaign, he said, but this is an unlikely option for matching the $512,000 that the UUT could have provided.</p>\n<p>It is also possible that the CSD board could apply for federal grants. The ultimate fate of the CSD, however, hangs on the passage of the UUT.</p>\n<p>According to Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), if voters do not approve the UUT before Jan. 1, 2023, the CSD shall be dissolved as of that date.</p>\n<p>This leads to another issue: deciding when to put the UUT on the ballot again.</p>\n<p>Elliott said CSD board members could very well decide to propose the UUT in the next midterm election in two years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74096\" style=\"width: 6010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1521561605\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74127\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74096\" data-attachment-id=\"74096\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/flashback-election-2012/dsc03790/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=6000%2C4000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"6000,4000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dsc03790\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74096\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Shelley Kim / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=6000&amp;ssl=1 6000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC03790.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Shelley Kim / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>However, running another campaign would prove costly, Freeman said, and organizers are unsure where to obtain funds for subsequent campaigns. He said it would also be difficult to have voters approve a tax that has already been denied.</p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong?</strong><br>\nAccording to Freeman, those active in the CSD movement for the past two years never talked much about the prospect of the CSD passing without the tax. Many proponents took it as given, he said, that the tax and the CSD would both pass.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the Yes on the E&amp;F campaign organizers limited their support by tying their campaign strictly to the campaigns of local Democrats like Congressional candidate Salud Carbajal and Third District County Supervisor candidate Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>“They lost a lot of opportunity to form a coalition of disparate politicians,” he said.

She said they misled voters to believe the tax would significantly increase rent, when, in actuality, the tax would have only been an additional $5 to $10 every month.</p>\n<p>Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes also gained an advantage over Yes on E&amp;F, she said, because they placed flyers on cars throughout Isla Vista. According to Elliott, this is what made Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes an “illegal” campaign.</p>\n<p>“If we left flyers on everyone’s cars, the results might have been different, but we would have been breaking county ordinance,” she said.</p>\n<p>Chuck Eckert, an Isla Vista property owner who led the opposition to Measure F, said the measure didn’t pass simply because it is a “horrible” measure. This is why voters were afraid, he said.</p>\n<p>“What [Elliott] says is probably true, but a lot of times the truth will make people fearful of what will happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>Fear is the reason Measure F failed, Elliott said, and it has been a driving force throughout this election cycle.</p>\n<p>“In general in this election, fear won over hope,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 10, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/","id":4480,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4479,4478,4477],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
