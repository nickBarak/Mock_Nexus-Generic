It’s about ‘what did we do? What happened?’ When you lose, don’t lose the lesson.”</p>\n<p>This weekend, Santa Barbara will be playing in the annual Hilton Concord Classic tournament on Friday and Saturday, facing two worthy opponents – Saint Mary’s of California and (2-1) and University of Alabama Birmingham (3-0).</p>\n<p>“I’ll start working on Saint Mary’s and I’m going to have to sneak a peek at UAB, because we can’t just turn that over overnight,” Henrickson said. “Some of the stuff they run offensively, both teams play man so that helps us, we’re not having to work on man and zone [defense]. And some of the things that UAB runs, we have defended already. But obviously our primary focus is to get ready for Saint Mary’s because we’ve got our hands full because they’re a really talented team.”</p>\n<p>The first opponent, Saint Mary’s, is coming off a dominating 82-64 home win versus Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Sydney Raggio finessed her way to her second double-double of the season, scoring a game-high 23 points and grabbing a whooping 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>SMC has been an offensively powerful team, winning their last two games after opening up their season with a loss. A pivotal aspect of their wins has been a strong offensive presence in the first quarter, bursting on the court with shot after short, setting the pace for the game and giving themselves a nice lead.</p>\n<p>The Gaels hurdled their way to an early 11-5 lead in the first quarter against the Cougars, and went on a 9-0 run in the first quarter to go up at 11-5 versus the Broncos. They won both games by over 5 points or more.</p>\n<p>“Saint Mary’s is a lot of ball reversals, with at least [probably] two to three on-ball screens –what they run offensively, so we’ve started to look at that already.” Coach Henrickson enlightened.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to keep their foot on the gas against the offensively aggressive home team, being careful not to give up a lead like they did against The Redhawks, or fall behind too early as was the case against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>Being that it is a tournament, though, the next opponent on UCSB’s itinerary is another commanding challenger.</p>\n<p>The Blazers, the second UCSB opponent of the event, is coming in hot with a currently undefeated record of 3-0.</p>\n<p>The University of Alabama at Birmingham has crushed each of their last three adversaries, winning each game by a large margin of 10 points or more.</p>\n<p>Their most recent faceoff was against the Miles Golden Bears, in which UAB held their foes to only 2 points in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The home team Blazers utilized a vicious well-adjusted game plan consisting of both intense offense and suffocating defense. They dominated the paint by scoring a notable 40 points to Miles’ 14, while also outrebounding the Golded Bears, 43-to-31.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Rachael Childress was in attack mode, chalking up 14 points to lead the Blazers in scoring.</p>\n<p>UAB has not scored less than 13 points in any quarter in all of their last three games.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team will need to make sure they stay firm on defense, hard-hitting on offense, and remain fundamentally sound, in order to overcome the well-rounded force of the Blazers.</p>\n<p>The quick turnaround from one game to another is not something to be taken lightly, but the factor of the unknown is not an issue.</p>\n<p>“The good thing for us is, we know it’s UAB. We know it’s not the winner of UAB or Indiana. It’s good that we know it’s UAB from a prep standpoint, cause to try and prepare for three teams right now, would be difficult for us and challenging, for as young as we are. So, we might sneak in some stuff on Wednesday [at practice] that might be different for us, that we haven’t seen.”</p>\n<p>According to Henrickson, her practices with the Gauchos are very tough, and is where she really pushes her players to see what they can do. She stressed that the disbursement of player minutes and standout bench play is going to be critical throughout the tournament, especially with such a young team.</p>\n<p>“It’s about production. Players earn minutes in practice. Our bench has to be ready to produce. We’ve got a strong bench and we’re very confident in that.”</p>\n<p>The youth of the team, along with the offensive woes of Santa Barbara, will all be put to the test this weekend.</p>\n<p>UCSB will first face-off against the Saint Mary Gaels this Friday, Nov. 24. And will then go head-to-head with the UAB Blazers on Saturday, Nov. 25.</p>\n<p>Both games in the tournament will take place in Moraga, California at McKeon Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79859\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79859\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-24/ucsb-to-participate-in-saint-marys-tournament-after-long-week-off/","id":663,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[662,661,660],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson","biography":"Not available","articles":[131,204,215,657,663,711,766,844,881,895,896,942,943,948,949,974,1877,3388,3400],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Looks to Break Three-Game Losing Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Times are tough for the UCSB men’s basketball team, but it is still fighting hard without its best player in sophomore center Alan “Big Al” Williams.

Everybody is pretty good at home by now,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Let’s wait and see Saturday who we have available, whether or not Al is back, whether or not Keegan is good, whether or not we have Nate and T.J. We have some things up in the air right now, so it either makes things a little more doable or a little more difficult.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara dropped a 57-55 contest on the road against Long Beach State Wednesday night for its third consecutive loss, all without Big Al. Despite injuries and a young squad, the Gauchos have shown toughness in sticking with opponents, but have not been able to get over a hump with a win.</p>\n<p>“The thing I liked the best about what we did at Long Beach was I thought we played really hard and that was a real positive sign,” Coach Williams said. “We were scrappy, tough minded and played hard.”</p>\n<p>Irvine is coming off a 52-45 victory against Cal Poly at home to bring its conference home record to 4-0. The Anteaters also feature six players who average 7.7 points or more per game, and are led by senior guard Daman Starring, who averages a team-best 13.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“They are a very deep team and it’s not a matter of any one guy; it’s a different guy for every game,” Coach Williams said. “Starring is a very good player, good shooter and versatile. [Senior center Adam] Folker I think the world of and [senior forward Michael] Wilder is very tough and competitive.”</p>\n<p>When the two teams previously played on Jan. 3, UCSB pulled out a 74-71 victory at the Thunderdome, but things may be different this time around at Irvine.</p>\n<p>“[Sophomore forward] Will Davis didn’t play against us last time, so that’s a different weapon for them,” Coach Williams said. “There are just a lot of different pieces to their puzzle that make them very difficult to play.”</p>\n<p>Big Al’s status for Saturday’s game is in question after missing the previous three games with a strained left hamstring tendon. Williams leads the team in points, rebounds and blocks, and is among the top three in the conference for each category as well.</p>\n<p>“He has not practiced at all,” Coach Williams said. “He is doing separate workouts, he’s back running, he’s back doing some lateral work and doing some one-on-one stuff. We’ll see; he’s making progress.”</p>\n<p>Junior forward Kyle Boswell has been the Gauchos’ leader since Big Al’s injury and is second on the team in scoring with 13 points per game. Freshman forward Taran Brown is right behind Boswell averaging 12.7 points per game. Brown also ranks second on the team in rebounds and blocks with averages of 5.8 boards and one block per game.</p>\n<p>In order to beat Irvine, the Gauchos will need to both provide a scoring boost and limit the Anteaters’ many weapons.</p>\n<p>“We have to make more shots and we have to find a way to keep people off the foul line,” Coach Williams said. “The number one thing that has been the consistency in all three games [during the losing streak] is that we’ve got our rear ends kicked from the foul line.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Irvine Saturday is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of February 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49964\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49964\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/","id":660,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[659,658,657],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Comeback Falls Short in Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Santa Barbara fell behind early in the first half against UC Irvine, and despite a furious second-half comeback, the Gauchos dropped a 62-60 decision off a game-winning three-pointer from Irvine.

Down by as much as 20, the Gauchos rallied behind strong play from Big Al who led all players with 22 points, eight rebounds and three steals.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Taran Brown sank a jumper with 21 seconds remaining to give UCSB a one-point lead, but Irvine forward Michael Wilder responded with a three-pointer with 10 seconds remaining to give the Anteaters the lead once more. Junior guard Kyle Boswell missed a three at the buzzer securing Irvine’s second consecutive victory.</p>\n<p>“I liked that we played well together, we fought and there was a lot more fight in us in the second half,” Coach Williams said. “[Irvine] got 10 offensive rebounds in the first half, they got none in the second half. [We] became a much more cohesive unit in that second half and played much better together.”</p>\n<p>Boswell scored 15 off the bench while freshman guard Michael Bryson added 12 points for the Gauchos. UCSB also played without freshman forward Mitch Brewe who was injured and ruled out for the year.</p>\n<p>While UCSB is disappointed by the loss, it has to feel encouraged by Big Al’s return to the lineup and his impressive performance in his first game back.</p>\n<p>“I thought he had a lot of rust on him, especially in the first half and was maybe a little tentative and got frustrated with himself a little bit in the first half,” Coach Williams said. “But I thought in the second half he was sensational.”</p>\n<p>Close contests have been unkind to the Gauchos recently as their four straight losses have been by a combined 15 points. UCSB has also lost two straight games by two points but has received solid play from many underclassmen in the face of injuries.</p>\n<p>“We’re still just trying to find a way to get ourselves healthy for a stretch run,” Coach Williams said. “I think the freshman have been stepping up pretty good. We’ve got a lot of contribution out of that freshman class. We’ve got a month and a half left in the season, it’s important that we keep getting better.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to action Thursday when it hosts UC Davis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 4th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/gaucho-comeback-falls-short-in-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/gaucho-comeback-falls-short-in-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/gaucho-comeback-falls-short-in-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/gaucho-comeback-falls-short-in-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-04/gaucho-comeback-falls-short-in-irvine/","id":661,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[660,659,658],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Season With Loss to UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/womens-tennis-file-photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/womens-tennis-file-photo.jpg?resize=682%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB opened the 2013 season with a tough loss to UCLA.

The number one doubles match saw sophomore Catherine Harrison / sophomore Kyle McPhillips of UCLA defeat senior Kiersten Meehan / Scatliffe of UCSB 6-1. The Gauchos came to play against the Bruins, but the skill level just did not add up for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“As a team, we have been trying to improve our aggressiveness and focus during important points for our matches. We have been doing a lot of specific point play during practice which require a certain amount of shots to be hit in a specific area, which helps with our focus and shot selection tremendously,” Scatliffe said. “We also do drills that are high in intensity and encourage little or no errors for an extended amount of playing time.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos start the season with a loss, they look to bounce back with their home opener this Sunday against San Francisco. The match is set to begin at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 22, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53635\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/ucsb-opens-season-with-loss-to-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53635\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/ucsb-opens-season-with-loss-to-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/ucsb-opens-season-with-loss-to-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/ucsb-opens-season-with-loss-to-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/ucsb-opens-season-with-loss-to-ucla/","id":662,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[661,660,659],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
