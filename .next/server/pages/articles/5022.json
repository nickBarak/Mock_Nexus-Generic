","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 6 UCSB men’s water polo team has a great opportunity to pick up some much needed conference wins this weekend when it takes on San Jose State and No. 5 Stanford, who both have yet to record a conference win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos head into the weekend with a solid 12-7 overall record and a 1-3 record in MPSF play. San Jose State has struggled this season with a 3-15 record and 0-3 start in conference play while Stanford has the best overall record of the bunch at 14-6 but has struggled in MPSF play at 0-3. The Cardinals are currently in a slump, having lost their last four matches. Santa Barbara is currently sitting in seventh place in the MPSF standings while SJSU and Stanford are both tied for last place.</p>\n<p>“I think we are playing really good water polo right now,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We are on a roll right now. We lost to a top-notch program but it was hard-fought; if we can play like that we will come back this weekend with two wins.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_65584\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_Eric_Swenson_005-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"921006720\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65662\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65584\" data-attachment-id=\"65584\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/gauchos-confident-in-extending-their-success-on-the-road/cameron-yates-attempts-to-block-a-shot-on-goal-eric-swensondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_Eric_Swenson_005-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"8\",\"credit\":\"Eric Swenson\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Cameron Yates attempts to block a shot on goal.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Despite losing eight of its last nine matches, San Jose State’s denial to concede to defeat makes the team a challenging competitor. Key players for the Spartans include freshman driver Justin Contreras and sophomore two-meter defender Igor Miljan. The young players are the leading scorers for SJSU, with 19 goals and 18 goals respectively. One possible reason for the Spartans’ troubles this season is their lack of experience. SJSU is currently the only MPSF team that has no senior on its roster.</p>\n<p>A big breakout player to keep an eye on this weekend for the Gauchos is Derek Shoemaker. The senior attacker became the leading goal scorer for UCSB with 28 goals. He had a great weekend in which he set a new career high for himself with four goals in one game against LBSU. However, Shoemaker is more than just a scorer. He is also the team leader in field blocks with 11, third in assists with 11 and fifth in steals with 14.</p>\n<p>“I like to bring everything to the team,” Shoemaker states. “I’m not trying to score all the goals — me and my teammates just want to stay aggressive. We have a bunch of great players on this team. I just like to do anything I can.”</p>\n<p>However, the number one weapon for the Gauchos continues to be senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge, the MPSF leader in saves per game with 10.7. UCSB is a team that continually preaches great defense and proved it last weekend, holding the No. 2 Trojans to their second lowest scoring total of the season by surrendering just six points. The senior played a big role not only in that game but in every game as he continues to prove he is one of the best goalkeepers in MPSF history.</p>\n<p>The senior goalkeeper will need to play especially well when the team travels to face Stanford and the MPSF leader in goals scored Bret Bonanni. The senior has scored 58 goals this year and is also the only player in MPSF history to have two 90-goal seasons. The 2014 FINA Men’s Water Polo Player of the Year is also eight goals away from becoming the leading scorer in MPSF history.</p>\n<p>“We know who he is,” Wigo said. “And we are going to be aware of where he is at all times. In a way it makes it easier, since we know who to focus on, but it will still be tough.”</p>\n<p>Stanford’s other key offensive weapon is Adam Abdulhamid. The redshirt junior driver is second on the team with 45 goals scored. The Cardinals’ staggering offense has scored an astonishing 303 goals this season. The last time these two teams met was one year ago in which Stanford won 13-6.</p>\n<p>While not facing a must-win situation, victories this weekend could be a substantial jump for the Gauchos becoming a true contender in MPSF play. Although both matches are away, UCSB is unbeaten on the road with a 2-0 record.</p>\n<p>“We feel good about these games,” Shoemaker said. “Obviously we love to play at home but we are going to go in there and play the same way.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not a big concern to us,” Wigo added. “We won’t have our big home crowd, but it’s not like we are going into the Roman Colosseum — we just have to focus on what we are doing and we will be okay.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s bout at San Jose State will begin at 2 p.m. on Friday, then Santa Barbara will travel to Stanford to play the Cardinals at 12 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 24th.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Ruddins has picked up Big West Freshman of the Week honors for three consecutive weeks after earning three straight all-tournament team honors and leads the team with 196 kills at an average of 4.45 kills per set.</p>\n<p>Hoffman boasts the second most kills on the team with 137, providing the Gauchos with a dominant one-two punch on the outside that opponents have struggle to answer against.</p>\n<p>Senior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt seems to be on her way to an All-Big West team after earning an Honorable Mention the past two years. She is averaging a team-high .95 blocks per set, providing the Gauchos with a force in the middle that has been essential to their early season success.</p>\n<p>“Phoebe has been the most consistent for us,” Lantagne Welch explained before noting her .410 hitting percentage during the non-conference schedule to lead all Big West players. For her fourth straight season, she’s providing UCSB with excellent all-around play, and, with this young team, her leadership has never been more vital.</p>\n<p>The UCSB defense has been propped up by sophomore defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi who is one of two Big West players to amass over 200 digs in non-conference play. She’s been seemingly everywhere on the court, and the Gauchos will be relying on her prowess when facing the talent within the Big West.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will be on the road for the first time this season as it played all 11 of its non-conference matches at home in the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p>With a 7-4 record, the Rainbow Wahine are 14th in the national Division I rankings and will be one of the toughest teams the Gauchos have faced so far.</p>\n<p>After missing the first three matches of the season, senior outside hitter and last year’s Big West Player of the Year Nikki Taylor leads the Big West with 5.41 kills per set, almost a full kill more than Ruddins, who holds second place by a sizable margin.</p>\n<p>Junior libero and defensive specialist Savanah Kahakai is third in the Big West with 4.40 digs per set, only slightly behind Petrachi, and she’s sure to make things difficult for the Gaucho offense throughout the match.</p>\n<p>Junior middle hitter Emily Maglio will only make matters more difficult for UCSB as her 1.25 blocks per set rank second in the conference, not to mention her jarring .390 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>The veteran laden Rainbow Wahine will provide an important test for the Gauchos to open conference play as Coach Lantagne Welch mentioned UCSB’s tendency to “make rookie mistakes” in certain situations.</p>\n<p>“The big thing is, if we take care of our side and [ride] out at a really high percentage, we’re going to be in a good situation,” Lantagne Welch said.</p>\n<p>Thus far, it has been an exciting season for the Gauchos who have showed that youth doesn’t always need time to mature before success. A visit from the 2015 Big West champions will provide a true test for the young squad who finished a modest 3-13 in conference play last season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos certainly think they belong, however, and Lantagne Welch is fully committed to ensuring that she and her team believe they are capable.</p>\n<p>“We do have some goals; we want to go after this Big West championship,” Lantagne Welch said. “[Most importantly], focusing on what we can do this day and focus[ing] on our next match.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and Hawaii will face off on Friday, Sept. 23 at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of September 22, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72520\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72520\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/gauchos-set-for-conference-home-opener/","id":5019,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[5018,5017,5016],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Seeking First MPSF Win of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_Eric_Swenson_008-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_WP_LMU_9.27_Eric_Swenson_008-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The No. 6 UCSB men's water polo team prepares to travel to Long Beach State on Saturday and will return home to Campus Pool to host the Trojans on Sunday.

UCSB has won all previous meetings this season against LBSU, including a 12-6 victory this past Sunday. The 49ers have struggled mightily against Santa Barbara averaging 6.3 points against them this season, their lowest total against any one team.</p>\n<p>“Defense is really the number one thing,” Wigo explained. “We want to make sure they earn every goal. If we do that we will find the back of the net enough to win.”<br>\nOne player who has played especially well for the Gauchos lately is sophomore attacker Shane Hauschild. The 2014 MPSF Freshman of the Year added nine goals at the SoCal tournament, including three against LBSU, which led the team. The sophomore attacker leads the team in goals as well as points with 25 and 38, respectively.</p>\n<p>“He’s been playing great this year,” Wigo said. “He has a tremendous shot. If you leave him open for a second too long he is accurate and he will make the other team pay.”</p>\n<p>Another player who has played well is junior Mitchell Hamilton. Hamilton spent his first two years at Cal. He played well there, scoring 16 goals in both seasons. However, the junior attacker has been a great addition to the Gauchos as he leads the team in steals with 16 and has already tied his career high in goals scored at 16.</p>\n<p>“I love Santa Barbara.” Hamilton said. “The guys really welcomed me when I came to the pool and coach Wigo, the captains, everyone is doing a great job. I think we really have a great chance at winning MPSF.”</p>\n<p>If LBSU hopes to break out of their three-game losing streak, both to Santa Barbara and their overall season, they will need key performances from redshirt freshman Austin Stevenson and senior Dimitros Lappas. Both are tied for most goals scored on the team with 16. The 49ers will also need to avoid slow starts as they have been outscored by opponents in the first half 71-47.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will then travel back home after their match against LBSU to face off against the Trojans at noon the next day. The Trojans are the top team in MPSF conference play heading into the weekend. These two teams are also no strangers as they met each other at the SoCal invitational with USC winning the match 10-8.</p>\n<p>“We started off the game in a bad position.” Hamilton said. “We went down a bunch of goals but we were able to come back and make it a game but it wasn’t enough. If we are ready off the bat who knows.”</p>\n<p>If Santa Barbara wants to pull off the upset, then it will have to find a way to stop Australian national team member Blake Edwards who has scored 47 goals this season, second highest in the MPSF. The junior driver also scored four goals against UCSB on Saturday with three coming in the first half alone. Sophomore Grant Stein is also a key player for USC scoring four goals against the Gauchos on Saturday with three in the second half alone.</p>\n<p>UCSB certainly has the players to play a great defensive match, especially when being led by senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge. Whitelegge continued his dominance totaling 51 saves this weekend and jumping up to the seventh most saves in MPSF history with 771.</p>\n<p>The Trojans’ 10 points on Saturday against the Gauchos was the fourth lowest total they had been held to all year. Clearly, Santa Barbara can keep up with the second best team in the nation, but they need to prove they can do more than just keep up; they need to prove they can win against a team of this caliber.</p>\n<p>“USC is a strong team and really disciplined,” Hamilton said. “But we are going to play our own game not USC style water polo.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is set to play at noon against LBSU Saturday at Long Beach before coming back home to host USC at the same time Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of October 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

However, the Gauchos gave up six goals in the second quarter and found themselves down 6-3 at half.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Shane Hauschild, who had an absolutely brilliant tournament, scored a total of six goals on Sunday, with three against Pacific. However, the sophomore attacker was not enough to overcome a dominant Pacific team, which added six more goals in the second half to beat the Gauchos 12-5.</p>\n<p>Before a disappointing finish, UCSB had played a great match against No. 8 LBSU. The Gauchos were down 3-2 after the first frame but were able to rebound and go up 4-3 at the half. The tie-breaking goal was made by senior attacker Derek Shoemaker, which gave UCSB its first lead of the match. From that point on, the Gauchos never let go of the lead given to them by their senior attacker. Helped by Hauschild’s three goals, UCSB was able to pull away in the second half and win the match 12-6.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a seemingly identical outcome on Saturday as they did Sunday. Just as UCSB finished Sunday night with a disappointing result, the same happened one night prior against No. 2 USC.</p>\n<p>The quarter-final match started off very one sided. Led by junior Blake Edwards’ three goals in the first half, USC was able to establish a good 6-1 lead late in the second. Despite the slow start UCSB picked up its pace, scoring two goals in the final two minutes to make the score 6-3 at the half.</p>\n<p>Jordan’s two goals and junior attacker Mitchell Hamilton’s goal in the third frame helped cut into USC’s lead and made the score 8-6. The Gauchos fought hard in the fourth but they could not cut any deeper into the Trojans’ lead. A great three-goal performance in the second half by sophomore Grant Stein proved to be too much as USC held on to win 10-8.</p>\n<p>Just like Sunday, before a tough loss to one of the best teams in the country the Gauchos were able to pull off a great performance against No. 15 UC San Diego.</p>\n<p>The Tritons’ senior Chase Cockerill started the scoring with a goal 30 seconds into the game, but the Gauchos came back firing on all cylinders, scoring four goals in the first frame all by different players to take a 4-2 lead. Santa Barbara and UC San Diego each scored two goals in the second period to make the halftime score 6-4. Hauschild added both goals for UCSB in that second quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started the scoring in the second half with two early goals courtesy of junior utility Reed Cotterill and junior utility Tor Jensen. Just as UCSB looked to run away with the match the Tritons were able to add their own two goals and make the score 8-6 heading into the final frame.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the game against UC San Diego the way they started — firing on all cylinders. The Gauchos scored four goals in the fourth, again each by different players, while only allowing two to win the game 12-8. Senior goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge also had a tremendous game, tallying up 16 saves for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did not finish the tournament winners; however, it was not a completely disappointing effort. The Gauchos were able to improve upon their performance last year in this tournament and really saw their stars like Hauschild, Shoemaker and Whitelegge shine at certain points.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face off against a team they beat in this invitational, LBSU, in Long Beach on Saturday at 12 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
