Earth Day to support local environmentalism. Brimer also said people should view the environment the same way they see their homes and not allow littler to accumulate.</p>\n<p>“If your house is filled with trash, you would not enjoy it,” Brimer said. “The earth is my home so it does make me uncomfortable to see things like littering.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Andrea Renteria said she tabled with her sociology class, Topics in Sexuality, to inform Earth Day attendees that overpopulation is threatening the environment.</p>\n<p>“We are tabling because, if we can control the increase in size of the population, we can lessen problems that directly affect our environment,” Renteria said. “It is through actions where we will see change.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year mathematics major Jose Lombera said students should lead by example to initiate change in the environment.</p>\n<p>“If we recycle more and keep our community clean, more people will follow this positive model which is good to our earth,” Lombera said. “Future generations can better the environment, but it is up to us to make it as great as we can.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_62799\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62799\" data-attachment-id=\"62799\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/i-v-earth-day-highlights-environmental-issues/iv-earth-day-festival-anisqoyo-park-april-25th-2015-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,429\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D600&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1429985213&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.001&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;IV Earth Day Festival, Anisq'oyo Park, April 25th, 2015.&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IV Earth Day Festival\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?fit=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62799\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IVearthDay_Hari-Patel-4.jpg?resize=600%2C429\" alt=\"80's Alumni band The Tearwayas performed during the Earth Day festival.

The services provided by the proposed CSD currently include the ability to fund a municipal advisory council (M.A.C.), which would be an advisory board with no taxation power recommending certain policies to the county board of supervisors. Other services would include an area planning commission, managing a parking district, the ability to contract for additional policing services above the current level provided by the county and university, managing a tenant mediation program to work out disputes between tenants and landlords, the ability run community facilities and the ability to manage lighting and sidewalks.</p>\n<p>Community organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliot hosted the conference, during which community members had the chance to speak about their opinion on two ideas related to governance. The first proposal of an I.V. CSD was presented by economics professor Lanny Ebenstein, while a second proposal was presented by former resident and alumnus Eric Hutchins.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What you might want to do is stop the endless discussion and start thinking on more global or situational terms. – Former resident and alumnus Eric Hutchins</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ebenstein said an I.V. CSD board could potentially have seven members, one of which would be appointed by UCSB Chancellor Henry T.

For me, what that meant was it would be easier to be the task of this group to essentially create two bookend proposals for CSD … and ask the university chancellor and university trustees who are perhaps inconveniently your best friends right now in terms of getting anything through because they have already taken positions on the CSD.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S.

CSD board, the geographic boundaries for candidates and the number of board members.</p>\n<p>The top choices in each category included university-appointed and Santa Barbara County-appointed members, the CSD boundary comprising either the “box” of I.V. plus university owned property or the box and the West Campus and El Colegio residences, and unanimous agreement for a five-members elected to the I.V. CSD board. Agreement was not unamimous however on the boundaries of an IVCSD.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly detailed the Ebenstein plan as calling for three appointed members of the CSD. That is incorrect, the story has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62412\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62412\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/","id":4722,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4721,4720,4719],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic Building to discuss funding an independent financial feasibility study that would break down the costs of pursuing different forms of governance, including a Community Services District (CSD), cityhood and a Municipal Advisory Council. The Fund for Santa Barbara, a nonprofit organization that supports grassroots organizations in Santa Barbara county, expressed interest in organizing the study using funds gathered from local groups and organizations.</p>\n<p>Interim Executive Director of the Fund for Santa Barbara Nancy Weiss said it would cost around $40,000 to conduct a feasibility study for a CSD, with an additional $16,000-$20,000 for cityhood and $10,000 for legal analysis of I.V.’s potential self-governance options. According to Weiss, approximately $32,000 has been committed by community organizations to support these costs.</p>\n<p>“There are a number of commitments that have been made either in writing or verbally for paying for the study,” Weiss said. “That includes individuals and some major entities like UCSB and City College.”</p>\n<p>Even with enough money, the financial feasibility study would still require several months of collecting and analyzing information to complete, according to Weiss.</p>\n<p>“By the time we press go, sign a contract and have it start, what I understand is two to three months will then be needed to gather all this data and crunch it,” Weiss said. “At this point I don’t even know when a start date will be.”</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, Community Organizer from the Office of Das Williams, said her existing relationships with local agencies can speed the data collection process.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the time it takes for the study is gathering information and reaching out to agencies and all that stuff to get numbers,” Elliott said. “Since I already have relationships with all those agencies, I have a lot of that information that I can send to them that will help speed it along.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud, online crowdfunding is another source of revenue that could help pay for the feasibility study.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said fundraising can be done through the I.V. Community Relations Committee as well.</p>\n<p>“We would probably be open to it,” Schunk said. “We could do micro-donations.”</p>\n<p>Participants plan to discuss the boundaries that could potentially be under the administration of a local government in I.V. at next week’s stakeholders’ meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-62679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Nagase/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista and university stakeholders are exploring new methods to cope with current drought conditions given California Governor Jerry Brown’s state-mandated water restrictions issued earlier this month.</p>\n<p>State regulators discussed Brown’s water reduction rules this past Saturday, which cut urban potable water use by 25 percent statewide. According to a California State Water Boards press release, on March 17 the State Water Resources Control Board adopted emergency regulations that apply to all California residents, prohibiting runoff irrigation to non-irrigated areas, driveway and sidewalk washing and hose use without shutoff nozzles to wash vehicles. In addition, restaurants and other food service establishments have been mandated to only serve water to customers on request.</p>\n<p>UCSB Sustainability Recycling and Water Efficiency manager Matthew O’Carroll said the Goleta Water District has robust water conservation programs and relatively low per-capita water use in comparison to other water districts. According to O’Carroll, further water reductions at the university will require higher expenditures.</p>\n<p>“UCSB’s biggest challenge is achieving further potable water reductions,” O’Carroll said in an email. “Just last year, we reduced our potable water consumption 21% compared to the previous year and we are at a point now where we have picked a lot of the ‘low-hanging fruit.’ So future strategies that yield significant potable water savings will also have large upfront costs.”</p>\n<p>According to O’Carroll, while reduction in potable water consumption is a top priority, water conservation for landscape maintenance is less of a priority due to the university’s use of recycled water.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is fortunate enough to have recycled water, a source of water that is of lesser quality than potable/drinking water, but which can be used for certain applications such as irrigation,” O’Carroll said. “Ninety percent of our campus is irrigated with recycled water, and to be honest, if we didn’t have this source, landscape and irrigation could possibly be our largest area of potable water consumption.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks Department (IVRPD) general manager Rodney Gould said that while recycled water is beneficial to the university in water conservation, it is inaccessible in Isla Vista due to lack of funds.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately the distribution lines for recycled water stop at UCSB and don’t reach Isla Vista,” Gould said. “We asked Goleta Water District if they would extend the pipes but they indicated they don’t have the funds to do so. If we can find the funding for the infrastructure, they would provide the water.”</p>\n<p>According to Gould, while IVRPD has made significant cuts in water consumption in the past few years, more conservation efforts will be necessary with potentially increasing rates based on a Stage 3 surcharge.</p>\n<p>“With proposed changes in Goleta Water District’s billing structure, the District could potentially experience a $38,000 annual rate increase,” Gould said. “We’ve been watching our water usage very carefully and on average have cut back by 25 percent as compared to the 2012-2013 fiscal year. We’re also in the process of auditing the irrigation in all of our parks looking for leaks, and calculating usage in specific areas.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Food Co-op produce manager Rebekah Miles said local produce suppliers have been hit the hardest, while the Co-op itself has not been greatly affected by the water shortages.<br>\n“For example, we usually have a constant supply of local avocados, but this is the first time in the four-and-a-half years I’ve been here that we’ve had a three month gap in avocado supply,” Miles said.</p>\n<p>Miles also said in addition to water shortage, farmers have been dealing with various pests that are especially prevalent during droughts, such as the bagrada bug that feasts on brassica, a certain leafy green produce.</p>\n<p>“Brassicas include cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower and various other leafy greens, all of which we carry at the Co-op,” Miles said. “Organics do not use pesticides, so these bugs are really causing problems especially in dry conditions.”</p>\n<p>O’Carroll said members of the UCSB Bren School formed the Water Action Plan in 2013 after the university surpassed the 20 percent potable water use reduction goal by 2020 mandated by UC Office of the President. According to O’Carroll, developing the Water Action Plan helped identify the major consumers of potable water on campus, which are bathrooms and labs, primarily in academic buildings and residence halls.</p>\n<p>“The majority of our potable water consumption is in academic buildings and in residential housing,” O’Carroll said. “In academic buildings we are looking at more efficient water fixtures in both bathrooms and the lab setting.”</p>\n<p>O’Carroll said in addition to short-term modifications to conserve water, such as bathroom retrofitting, educational campaigns are also a part of Housing and Residential Services water conservation efforts.</p>\n<p>“Housing and Residential Services has continued their commitment to conserving water and has continued to outfit the residence halls with efficient fixtures and also have a very robust education and outreach program,” O’Carroll said.</p>\n<p>Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) co-chairs third-year biology major Heather Vest and third-year environmental studies major Jennifer Suh said in a joint statement that changing personal eating habits is one of the most difficult parts about conserving water.</p>\n<p>“One method to reduce is cutting down on water-intensive food choices such as almonds, meat and walnuts, which use a hearty supply of water to produce,” Vest and Suh said in an email. “So much of California’s water usage is agricultural, so it’s important to consume less.”</p>\n<p>According to Vest and Suh, water conservation is most significant at the individual level.</p>\n<p>“As students at UCSB, we often find it difficult to see any effects on our lives personally because with the ways we live, we don’t pay for our water sources within campus and/or Isla Vista housing, so many students do not see the need to decrease our water usage,” Vest and Suh said. “But we need to make choices every day that show we are conscious of the situation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/ucsb-tackles-california-drought/","id":4724,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[4723,4722,4721],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
