Having smaller labia is just as normal as having bigger ones.</p>\n<p>You might be familiar with stories about how those with body issues came to be that way. About how they thought they were perfectly normal, until one day, someone made a comment to tell them they aren’t. And so begins a spiral of self-consciousness and body image issues.</p>\n<p>You see, I thought I was totally normal. That is, until I started reading literature written by people attempting to eliminate the ideal of the small labia who, in the process, painted those labia as unnatural. There seems to be a tendency that attempts to boost a group that is marginalized by putting down the rest of us who happened to not be a part of that group.</p>\n<p>Anything someone is born with is “normal”: Small labia, large labia — whatever the case may be. If you want to change that, that’s your prerogative. If you need to change it for medical reasons, by all means do it. But you shouldn’t be SHAMED into changing it, or into NOT changing it.</p>\n<p>Whatever we are born with is something to be proud of, not ashamed of.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article was submitted anonymously.</em></p>\n<h6> Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the<em> Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

I believe the audience in the Pollock did as well, as they were not only laughing uproariously at the string of witticisms that flowed freely from his mouth, but also at the rest of the characters, realized by the collaborative efforts of John McNamara and Jay Roach.</p>\n<p>The eponymous film relegates the most turbulent period in the screenwriter’s life — during which he and his fellow members of the Hollywood Ten were blacklisted from working in Hollywood thanks to the U.S. government finding them in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify.</p>\n<p>The film is about an ideological battle for justice, as well as a study of Trumbo as a person. The acclaimed writer is a Communist who loves money and a family man more invested in his work than family. He’s an intellectual blind to the fact that his crusade is hurting those he cares about, yet he continues to undermine the forces that put him and his fellow writers out of mainstream Hollywood by writing for a B-movie studio (run by John Goodman in his usual fine, somewhat disgruntled form) and working with fellow blacklisted writers, one of whom is played by the suitably acerbic Louis C.K. But I digress. Will “Trumbo” earn Bryan Cranston his first Oscar? Who knows, but if he doesn’t at least get nominated, I’ll (insert half-assed Cold War joke disguised as a threat here) the Academy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Out of the film’s expansive ensemble cast, some other notable and as of yet unmentioned names include Elle Fanning as Trumbo’s strong-willed daughter Nikola (a role she absolutely excels in), Alan Tudyk as indignant writer Ian McLellan Hunter (and former professor of McNamara’s) and Christian Berkel in a hilariously scene-stealing performance as the dry-humored director of “Exodus,” Otto Preminger. However, I do have to admit confusion as to why Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje got such a high billing in the credits; while he was quite good in his role, he was onscreen for less than ten minutes.</p>\n<p>When it comes to a film such as this one, however, credit absolutely must be given to the screenwriter. McNamara managed to generate smart humor and really rile up the emotions in his script. Often, the humor comes from the dialogue as opposed to the situations the characters find themselves in (with the exception of one gleefully violent scene featuring John Goodman taking a baseball bat to a politician in the epitome of a liberal apologist’s wet dream), showcasing the biting wit of Hollywood’s best.  Through both the celebrity figures’ and the common man’s treatment of Trumbo and company, we are reminded of how overwhelmingly, cruelly paranoid (and, in John Wayne’s case, even somewhat hypocritical) communist-era America was. In light of … ahem, recent events, one cannot help feeling a sense of déjà vu; as Roach said during the Q&amp;A portion of the Pollock screening, “Who would spend millions of dollars on a committee to ask hours of questions and get nothing?” Ouch.</p>\n<p>Once the film was over and the applause had died down, the gangly Roach and the squinting McNamara strode onstage to be greeted by the smiling Pollock director, Matthew Ryan. When asked about how he had come to write the film, McNamara described how he had first encountered Bruce Cook’s biography Dalton Trumbo in his 20s, only to adapt it 30 years later. A friend who had read the book convinced him when he they said, “It’s the rarest thing: a true story with a happy ending.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, former “Austin Powers” director Jay Roach (a franchise which he said he’d be willing to work on again) sung the praises of many, including McNamara for his script and the Hollywood Ten for their sarcastic wit. He told amusing stories about the cast as well, such as recounting Helen Mirren’s love for her character’s hats and Elle Fanning’s unnerving ability to refrain from blinking. Roach also highlighted the conservative views America held at the time, highlighting his father’s own opinions and the film industry’s efforts to make Hollywood seem more “American.”</p>\n<p>“Trumbo’s” ultimate prevailing theme (one which the trailer shoves in your face) is that nobody has the right to tell you what to do and how to think. If someone like Dalton Trumbo comes face to face with overwhelming odds and stand up against them, they’ll come out all the stronger in the end. And no matter how bad the fight gets, nobody is ever truly alone.  If I may paraphrase the line that got the loudest applause, “For better or worse…we are Spartacus.”</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung would like to say that the experience was worth sitting in the front row, as well as the ensuing cramping in the back of his neck.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-success-chiseled-in-stone-trumbo-screens-at-pollock/","id":5907,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5906,5905,5904],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor: The Cocaine Problem","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I graduated in 2011 from this wonderful school of ours with four years’ worth of great memories and friends.

I can honestly say that my time at UCSB was the happiest four years of my life. About a month after graduation, I moved to Belize with a two-year job commitment with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps.</p>\n<p>But the reason I’m writing this isn’t to make you jealous or to show off. I am writing an appeal to anyone who will listen. As it stands this tropical little “paradise” that is know about by few Americans (and of those mostly in terms of tourism) is bleeding out. Drug smuggling, gang violence and poverty are literally killing this nation. According to a U.N. report published in April 2012, Belize is the fifth most dangerous country in the world. A few months ago, three people were killed on the street in broad daylight. The government has responded by declaring that in certain areas, houses can be broken into and people can be arrested without a warrant. We have had enough experience with the Gang Suppression Unit to know this is a bogus solution. To make the point clear, the Police Commissioner’s wife was roughed up by police officers after she tried to stop them from beating up a man on the street.</p>\n<p>Why am I telling you all of this? Because one of the main causes of all of this pain is drug trafficking en route to the States. The coke that gets used during a weekend in I.V. is tied to the boy that is killed on the street here in Belize. I know this because I know kids who were in primary school when they were used as drug mules. It’s impossible to deny the damage that is linked to America’s drug habits. The death toll from the war on drugs and the cartels in Mexico is in the tens of thousands. I don’t want to sound sanctimonious or holier than thou, but if you decide to indulge in things that weren’t locally grown (if you catch my drift), even if it’s “just once to try it” or “only a few times when I’m really drunk” it adds fuel to this fire.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I am writing this because I believe that the average UCSB student doesn’t want to cause harm to others. On the contrary, I believe the average UCSB student is passionate about making the world a safer and more loving place, but sometimes we’re so trapped in our little surreal privilege bubble of university life that we forget that our actions do have consequences. My plea for you (and for everyone else) is to then help create a culture of resistance to cocaine or any other foreign drug use.</p>\n<p>There are some very smart people at UCSB who I have talked to about this who feel like legalization would be a great fix to this problem. While it may be someday, the reality now is that there is no such thing as “fair trade” cocaine. Also, I just don’t have enough blind faith in the “invisible hand” of the international free market to turn this industry bloodless. Why? Because while clothing, cell phones and Apple products are all legal, that hasn’t stopped the capitalistic pursuit of profit from creating inhumane conditions to make these products for consumers. One just has to look at Foxconn in China or Savar, Bangladesh to see the lengths people will go to make money. And drug cartels are nothing if not bloody efficient capitalists.</p>\n<p>Let people know it’s not cool, and that other human beings died in the process of getting that drug to California. Please don’t turn a blind eye to the sufferings of those who are victims of our people’s wealth and indulgences. There are plenty of strong and inspiring women and men in Belize who are trying to take back their country from the violence that plagues it. They don’t need our “help” as much as they need us to stop “harming.” I know there’s still enough hope and idealism at UCSB to make a difference.</p>\n<p><em>Janet Ornelas graduated in 2011 with a B.A. in Chican@ studies and Spanish.</em></p>\n<h6> This article appeared online only at dailynexus.com on Friday, May 31, 2013</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.

When a group of college kids get together and learn the business of planning, budgeting, scheduling and reaching out to talent, magic happens. But at this year’s Reel Loud, the 24th anniversary of the adored silent film festival — gosh, I hate to say it — the student coordination wasn’t as seamless as it could have been.</p>\n<p>First, the MCs were a bit awkward and lacked enthusiasm. Perhaps they were nervous or placed in at the last second, but the role of an MC is to butter up the crowd with corny jokes and provide easy transitions for performing acts. Reel Loud’s MCs did nothing of the sort and committed the ultimate MC crime: pronouncing names incorrectly. It was awful to listen to ten minutes of “Shag-nes-sai” when the silent auction winners were announced. Of course, it was impossible to do a night-before practice of winners’ names, but a five minute run-through before stepping out onstage would have done wonders.</p>\n<p>Another issue at Reel Loud was that parts of it were just plain random. DJ Allie from KCSB 91.9 FM came onstage in between Act I and II, and sat herself on a stool with a Macbook on her lap. She proceeded to play a 15 minute mash-up of famous movie lines and electric beats. The set featured flavorful movie throwbacks like “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” but the DJ’s placement atop a stool in the middle of the stage was random at best and boring at worst. DJ Allie is an enormously talented individual who runs KCSB, but having her sit cross-legged with a laptop and a spotlight shining on her pigtails was not the most entertaining situation at a film festival. Perhaps she could’ve been given a table to lean on and dance around, like a concert DJ.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But the most uncomfortable part of the night was when a music professor came onstage to grant music video legend Wayne Isham with the Inspiring Alumni Award. The music professor meant well, but his history lecture on MTV changing lives and how all Isham needed for his video for “Girls, Girls, Girls” was “motorcycles, girls — better yet — strippers,” was a little out of control. He kept going on and on with his life story, and kept getting cut off by a guy on the sidelines. It was painfully awkward to watch, like when your mother tries to be groovy and tells your friends she’s into wearing thongs now, like the underwear kind. Bleh, mom.</p>\n<p>When Isham finally hit the stage, he smoothed the crunchy peanut butter moment and stole the microphone. “I am so proud to be a fucking Gaucho,” he roared to the crowd. Isham is one badass cool dude who has directed classic videos for everyone from Metallica to Backstreet Boys. The music video legend lavished the films with compliments and made everyone feel good about themselves.</p>\n<p>“I sat back in my chair and went — oh. My fucking god! You’ve got THAT going on here! The music department kicks ass, the film department kicks ass. I am so proud to be a Gaucho,” Isham said, his gruff voice roaring out from beneath a thick beard. Long golden-gray hair shook around his face as he talked. The man looked straight out of Hells Angels and muttered f-bombs like there was no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“YOU inspire me. Forget about being alumni inspiration, I’m talking about the new generation. The new generation! You guys fucking rock … I need to start a new production company right here … this event was mind-blowing.”</p>\n<p>Given that Isham is a star director — the man did “Livin’ La Vida Loca” — his assessment of Reel Loud holds great weight. And in all honesty, the event’s content was pretty good. Art displays mixed with refreshments and a silent auction provided entertainment before the reels spun. Performances by a capella groups Vocal Motion and Brothas From Otha Mothas were met with a warm reception. The event itself — a silent film festival accompanied by live music — is a fantastic concept, and was executed as smoothly as 12 films with 12 different bands could.</p>\n<p>The films were short. Each was under seven minutes and was accompanied by a live ensemble. A favorite was “Choices,” a film by fourth-year physics major Michael Shaughnessy and second-year English major Kayla Barajas. “Choices” portrayed a hospitalized young man as he tried to replay what decisions he made which led to his accident. Heavy guitar strums built energy that complemented the fast scene changes.</p>\n<p>Other notable films included “Ten Toes,” which shows a man with the embarrassing problem of squeaky feet, and “Holy Grail,” a black-and-white movie about a depressed man who digs up a treasure chest that gives the gift of confidence. “Holy Grail” had the good fortune of having a soundtrack written by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-15/azeem-ward-overnight-flute-sensation/\">Azeem Ward</a>, the world-famous flautist.</p>\n<p>The reel that took home all the glory was “Out,” a cinematic creation by Emma Manley and Stefan Le. “Out” was Manley’s coming out story, and shows her chopping off her hair as she embraces her gender fluidity. It was beautifully shot with brilliant angles, and won the audience choice, cinematography and Scott Wells golden reel awards.</p>\n<p>A tender moment arose at the festival when “I.V. Strong” played scenes of last year’s memorial events. Almost exactly a year ago, film and music students were at Reel Loud when they heard the news that six fellow students had been shot. It was the site of disbelief. The inclusion of “I.V. Strong” allowed everyone to take a moment, reflect, and shed a few tears. It proved cathartic, especially when art professor Kim Yasuda came onstage to speak on the BLUNITE I.V. project.</p>\n<p>All in all though, Reel Loud 2015 could have exercised cleaner organization. But what the hell — if Wayne Isham said the event was mind-blowing, it might as well be true.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63944\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63944\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/","id":5909,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[5908,5907,5906],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
