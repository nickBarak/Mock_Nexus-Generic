Buckley was 260-231-1 during his tenure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since his firing, however, LBSU has managed to turn things around a bit. After starting the season 5-26, Long Beach State has won six of its last 15 games, including a sweep of UC Riverside — the only team to take two of three from the Gauchos this season — and nearly knocking off No. 1 UCLA this past Tuesday, losing in 12 innings 2-1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That may not seem like much, but it does highlight about how far this program has come in just the past month of play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, even in those 15 contests, LBSU has tallied 130 hits which is about eight hits per game, a solid number.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team’s .259 batting average as a whole might not seem great over the past 15, but it is up more than 48 points than where it was before. Overall, the team sports a .234 batting average which is dead last in the conference but, again, higher than it was before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LBSU’s pitching staff has also been revived during conference play. The Dirtbags have allowed the second-least hits (121) in conference play. The staff also holds the second-best ERA (4.67).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, despite LBSU’s record, the team does put up a fight in each contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twelve of Long Beach State’s last 15 games have been decided by two runs or fewer, with seven of those meetings being decided by just one run. The Dirtbags have gone just 1-6 in those seven one-run games and are 3-2 in matches decided by two runs over that span.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a few more things go right for them in some of these games, LBSU might be contending for a title as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, UCSB should still roll through the Dirtbags. The Gauchos’ pitching staff has combined to strike out 399 batters this season, topping the Big West. LBSU strikes out a good amount with 323 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, Santa Barbara’s offensive firepower might be too much for the Dirtbags to even think of overcoming.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right fielder Armani Smith has been on a tear lately as he currently owns a nine-game hitting streak. During that stretch, Smith has had five multiple hit games and gone an impressive 14 for 34 (.411) while also scoring seven runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This recent stretch has also seen his batting average jump 24 points as he now sports a .319 batting average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Martinez, Calif. native has accumulated one fourth of his total RBIs this season in just the last nine games for a total of 10. Smith also has 10 homers on the season, second best mark on the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the Gauchos have been especially tough to beat at home, owning an impressive 22-1 record in home games this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has won 15 consecutive games in Santa Barbara with the team’s last home loss coming on Mar. 17 against Cal Baptist. If the team can sweep, UCSB will have set a new program record for most consecutive wins at home in a single season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos last set that record in 2016 when they won 17 consecutive games. That was the same year UCSB went to its first ever College World Series. Coincidence? I guess we’ll find out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First pitch between LBSU and UCSB will begin at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 10 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

COLA organizers across the UC system called for the one-day strike, asking professors to halt lectures, students to walk out of class and for participants to wear black, hence the name “black-out” strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The motto of the UC system is “let there be light,” one speaker said at the Storke Tower noon rally. “When we wear black, it shows the UC administration that without graduate student labor, there is no light.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC-wide work stoppage started early morning on Thursday; at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, protesters blocked all four entrances to Cheadle Hall — UCSB’s administrative building — and stood shoulder-to-shoulder at each entrance. At the front entrance, organizers held a sign that read, “FUCK THE UC! AND A BITCH NAMED JANET.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some administrators who work in Cheadle Hall argued with strikers and attempted to force their way through but were pushed back, sending administrators and staffers circling around the building in hopes of finding another way in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, you guys, I don’t fucking support you. We have to work too,” one employee said to COLA organizers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers continued to refuse to allow administrators to enter into the building, including Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the UC Police Department and administration spoke with protesters, saying they had to move or risk being arrested, organizers regrouped and decided to move inside instead, occupying every floor of the building and chanting, “Don’t cross the picket, don’t be a scab,” to employees as they entered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One undergraduate advisor left his office to explain to strikers that “the students that we see are just as stressed as you are.” After organizers began arguing and chanting — drowning out the advisor</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Ry Brennan, one of COLA’s de-escalators, came to help defuse the situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brennan and the advisor reached a compromise, in which strikers would be alerted to stay quiet should any undergraduates come into the building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After occupying Cheadle Hall for most of the morning, organizers started to gear up for the noon rally. At approximately 11:30 a.m., students and faculty holding “Faculty for COLA” and “You’re gonna have to fire us too, Janet,” banners marched from Cheadle Hall to Storke Tower and met with demonstrators who had been there since 8 a.m. as part of their regularly scheduled strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Storke Tower, UC worker unions and academic associations expressed their solidarity with and support of UCSB’s COLA movement to an animated crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers representing different unions emphasized a message of solidarity between various unions, all fighting for better treatment from the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Colvin, a UCSB groundskeeper and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME) Local 3299 member, noted the similarities between the COLA movement and the labor strikes throughout the country, including AFSCME 3299’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">labor fight over the past few years. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every person in this country deserves that security, and that’s why we won’t stop fighting until we have a job that’s worth having and a way to pay rent. You have our support as workers, and I know not a lot of people [from AFSCME] made it out here today because they’re very busy, but I’ve been talking to them at work and you absolutely have our support,” Colvin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Colvin, Christopher John Newfield, a professor of literature and American studies at UCSB and second vice president of the executive council of the Modern Language Association (MLA) of America, emphasized the MLA’s “unanimous and quite enthusiastic” commitment to support the UC-wide strikers and condemned the termination of UCSC graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 1 p.m., the procession of approximately 3,000 marched to Henley Gate, garnering the attention of those on campus as they passed through the Arbor and University Library. Those in “precarious situations,” such as undocumented or international students, were encouraged to walk by organizers wearing red armbands and caution tape, who were designated de-escalators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Henley Gate, the crowd chanted, “Cops off campus, COLA in our bank accounts,” at cars driving by and police officers monitoring the event. Protesters stayed at the gate for nearly 30 minutes before walking back to Storke, where some remained to complete the daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York University sociology professor Andrew Ross visited Santa Barbara to take part in the strike, praising attendees as a catalyst for social change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Graduate student employees are the true conscience of the academic profession, and COLA strikers are the true conscience of the UAW,” Ross said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one deserves to be paid a poverty wage because they love teaching or because they’re training for a job in an academic profession,” he said. “That is not a principle of fair labor, that is a recipe for exploitation.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi and Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

grades</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earlier this week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB teaching assistants started their strike on Feb. 27, halting teaching and grading to advocate for a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), a monthly stipend of $1,807.51 that would be given to all graduate students to alleviate rising housing costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students were the last of any UC campus to continue withholding grades, with UCSC submitting earlier this week and other campuses like UC San Diego and UC Davis having been forced to submit grades in early April by campus administration under threat of disciplinary action. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email stated that the COLA movement at UCSB “has been ignored, disrespected, or patronized by an administration hoping this movement will wither and die” and explained that the Dean of Graduate Division wouldn’t negotiate with them and instead suggested they seek support at Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada was not immediately available for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 50 teaching assistants at UCSB were withholding grades prior to Thursday’s announcement, according to various COLA organizers. Graduate students initially expected this number to be higher, but the coronavirus pandemic and the shift to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meant that teaching assistants who had second and third jobs outside the university were vulnerable to unemployment and were compelled to submit grades to secure their jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without foreclosing the withholding of Spring grades, we have made the difficult decision to end our Winter grade strike, and marshal our full strength behind building a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/uaw-2865-to-vote-to-strike-over-unfair-practice-charges-against-the-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">union-sanctioned unfair labor practice (ULP) strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of February, the UC Regents </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), a charge filed to the state when an employer or union violates the National Labor Relations Act. The Regents alleged that United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW) — the union representing UC teaching assistants, readers and tutors — supported wildcat strikes and failed to take action to end the strike, according to the charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, UAW </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a> <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ULPs against the Regents, alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the COLA movement, such as failing to negotiate for a COLA with the union and instead bargaining with individual graduate students and groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW’s bargaining team is in the process of collecting signatures for a ULP strike, which would be similar in nature to the wildcat strikes — teaching assistants would stop instruction and would withhold grades — but because it would be sanctioned by the union, strikers under UAW are guaranteed protections, according to a </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/the-next-phase-of-the-cola-struggle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published on April 1 by UCSC COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The power to call a strike vote rests with UAW’s bargaining team, and UAW’s Joint Council told the bargaining team that it will recommend a strike vote once its <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ULP_Strike_Pledge\">strike pledge</a> reaches 5,000 signatures.

Yang and UCSB administration to address, which includes changing working conditions for graduate students under the coronavirus pandemic and greater transparency on how the $25 million in stimulus money allotted to UCSB by the federal government will be used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are “insisting” that some of this money go towards waiving or alleviating rent in UCSB-owned student and family housing, as well as rent assistance for graduate students living off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands also call for a walk-back of all strike-related discipline and a commitment to non-retaliation against all UC wildcats, along with the “reinstatement of </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fired UCSC graduate student workers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for current and future appointments.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In adapting to these circumstances</span><b>, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our refocus on alleviating rent and healthcare burden carries on the philosophical core of the COLA demand: that people deserve access to healthcare, housing, and living wages.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the COLA movement — both at UCSB and UC-wide —  has ceased grade withholding for the time being, organizers are still moving forward with other actions. On Friday, COLA organizers UC-wide held a one-day general strike for International Workers’ Day against unsafe working conditions brought on by the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers also wrote that the movement continues in a variety of formats online, and that it will continue in person once campuses are re-opened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the pandemic passes and our campus reopens (and both these events </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> occur), we do not intend to return to business as usual,” the email read.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/02/2020, 10:05 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that UAW would not vote to strike until they reach 5,000 signatures on their strike pledge.

And so taking that away from students who have those grades when we have them, I think is unfair,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In exchange for submitting withheld grades, some graduate students who were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dismissed from TA positions for spring quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be “considered for future appointments,” but Gilichinskaya said there are no guarantees of reinstatement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gilichinskaya</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, over 80 UCSC graduate students withheld grades during Fall Quarter 2019, which jumped to over 100 withholders by the end of Winter Quarter 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, around 80 UCSC graduate students who were dismissed from their spring TA positions are still without work, according to Gilichinskaya.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With UCSC graduate students now submitting grades before May 1, striking UCSB graduate students are the only grade withholders left in the UC system. UCSB </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">went on full strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Feb. 27,  meaning TAs ceased teaching and grading. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 55 UCSB graduate students are currently withholding winter quarter grades, according to Sheila Kulkarni, a chemistry and biochemistry Ph.D. student and the Recording Secretary for the UCSB unit of United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW), the union representing UC teaching assistants, readers and tutors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students are beginning to shift from withholding grades to pushing for UAW’s support in striking against </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/uaw-2865-to-vote-to-strike-over-unfair-practice-charges-against-the-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which are filed to the state when an employer or union violates the National Labor Relations Act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alleging that UAW supported wildcat strike efforts and failed to take action to end the strike, the UC Regents </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a ULP against UAW. Subsequently, UAW </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a> <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ULPs, alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the COLA movement, including failing to negotiate for a COLA with the union while instead bargaining with individual graduate students and groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to the current wildcat COLA strikes, potential backing from UAW in a strike against ULP charges would guarantee protections for striking graduate students, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to a </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/the-next-phase-of-the-cola-struggle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published on April 1 by UCSC COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These protections are necessary certainties in these uncertain times. They will allow us to strike against the university with the full weight of our statewide union behind us,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UAW-sanctioned strike would also shift the burden of withholding grades away from two campuses — UCSC and UCSB — toward a UC-wide approach at the union level by creating a system-wide strike, according to Gilichinskaya.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW’s bargaining team is in the process of obtaining signatures to allow a vote to decide on whether to strike over the ULP grievances. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TAs across the UC system are phone banking to help collect more signatures for the vote and , as of Monday, have obtained</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over 2,300 of the 5,000 in-unit signatures needed, according to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya’s email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya said that grade withholding in future quarters will continue if a ULP strike is to occur, but until then, graduate students are losing their “biggest leverage” in the COLA strikes against UCOP to demand a living wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Grades are what the university cares about. It doesn’t care about the quality of the education. It needs the grades for the bureaucracy to smoothly function,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Gilichinskaya said that due to the coronavirus pandemic — and the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">switch to remote learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that came with it — the COLA movement lost vital momentum that came from in-person picket lines. But she foresees “statewide massive withholding of teaching and grading labor” in the event of a union-sanctioned ULP strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people lost their second and third jobs. A lot of people weren’t as confident that they could risk their employment and their health insurance in the midst of a pandemic,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this leverage sort of didn’t have as much strength just because we didn’t have the numbers at the end of winter quarter.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
