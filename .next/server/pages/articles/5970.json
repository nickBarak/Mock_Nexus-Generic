It is a pro US-Israel relations group that aims to promote and strengthen the bond between the United States and Israel. Through our involvement in pro-Israel politics, we interact with key political figures, build strong relationships and ultimately help influence policy-makers both in the present and for the future.</p>\n<p>Along with other members of Gauchos for Israel, I was privileged to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s (AIPAC) three-day Policy Conference in Washington, D.C. which hosts 13,000 participants including 2000 students from all fifty states. I returned feeling not only more educated but also truly inspired to act.</p>\n<p>The convention offered a plethora of opportunities to hear distinguished speakers and attend breakout sessions that facilitated panel discussions. I was humbled by words of esteemed political leaders such as Senator John McCain, Israel’s Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Israel’s Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren, Vice President Joe Biden and even Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (via live video satellite). The breakout sessions were informational seminars led by experts in the field covering a variety of issues regarding the relationship between the United States and Middle Eastern nations. The session that most resonated with me was one entitled, “Sanctions Report Card: Can Economic Pressure Stop Iran’s Nuclear Program?”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Iran’s continued development of nuclear weapons, despite warnings from other countries, is an issue that is rapidly escalating. Regardless of Iran’s failing economy, they still remain persistent in their efforts. The United States has realized that this is not only a key problem to the State of Israel, but it also poses a security threat to the U.S. as well. In response, the Obama administration is currently implementing strict sanctions on Iran, most recently a unilateral trade sanction, H.R. 850 Nuclear Iran Prevention Act of 2013.</p>\n<p>Honorable Daniel Glaser, Assistant Secretary for terrorist financing in the United States Department of the Treasury, explained that this would target Iran’s ability to access the international finance system. Any country purchasing oil from Iran must now pay in its own currency, and Iran is no longer allowed to exchange this currency for its own. In addition, sanctions from the U.S. are threatened for any country that deals directly with the Iranian bank. The H.R. 850 Nuclear Iran Prevention Act was passed on February 6, 2013, and will have a huge impact on Iran’s already damaged economy.</p>\n<p>Even though many point to Iran’s evasion of sanctions through loopholes, Glaser reassured that the intelligence office is maintaining a close watch on Iran. Congress is also debating alternative options such as a viable military threat. Once Iran obtains nuclear capabilities, there is no reverting the fact that they could produce an atomic bomb at any given moment.</p>\n<p>The U.S. and Israel must work together to do all that is possible to prevent this precarious situation from confronting the international arena. Having studied abroad in Israel for four months, I feel that this issue not only affects Israeli citizens, but the American general public as well. As an American citizen, I deeply believe in the importance of a strong and united front against a potentially nuclear capable Iran.</p>\n<p>This conference as a whole made me realize how supportive the United States truly is toward its relationship with Israel. Hearing political leaders speak of their reliance on Israel and vice versa was incredibly empowering. I feel proud as an American to be helping to contribute to the safety of not only the citizens of Israel, but the security of the United States as well. I strongly believe that the alliance between the United States and Israel is strong, and will only continue to strengthen in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Ariel Brotman is a third-year psychology and Middle East studies Major.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at <em>dailynexus.com</em> on April 5, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50695\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50695\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/student-returns-from-convention-jazzed-on-us-israeli-relations-weary-of-iran/","id":5970,"author":{"id":488,"name":"Abriel Brotman"},"related":[5969,5968,5967],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":488,"name":"Abriel Brotman","biography":"Not available","articles":[5970],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Film Review: “Cerro Torre: A Snowball’s Chance in Hell” Provides Exhilarating Look at Patagonia Climbing Expedition","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/edit_200912274768cr54.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/edit_200912274768cr54.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Follow your dreams” is an often-repeated piece of advice that most have heard, and many agree on, but how does the well-known mantra fare when said dreams top over 10,000 feet off the ground?

According to David Lama and Peter Ortner: “follow them … and film it as proof.” In 2012, the two climbers embarked to ascend the Cerro Torre mountain in Patagonia, which measures 10,262 feet. The Cerro Torre was made famous and somewhat controversial in 1959 when Italian climber Cesare Maestri claimed to have reached the peak and was found a liar by almost everyone. Since then, many climbers have traveled to South America to try and recreate this feat along the now famous “Compressor Route,” named for a compressor Maestri left hanging off the face of the mountain, which still hangs there today.With the sponsorship of Red Bull Media, Lama and Ortner turned the experience into a documentary film. The final product was “Cerro Torre: A Snowball’s Chance in Hell,” which this reporter caught a viewing of at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on Thursday, Jan. 29. The intense climbing scenes were shot either by a film crew in nearby helicopters or POV cameras fastened to the climbers’ helmets for a more in-depth look. Although the movie is most suitable for climbing, nature or adventure enthusiasts, it isn’t without its funny moments. In one scene for example, Ortner woke up in his top bunk to find that Lama had tied him down to the bed so he wouldn’t fall (Lama later admitted to me that he was pretty hungover when this happened).</p>\n<p>From the age of five, Lama was fortunate enough to find his calling in life. He was a gifted climber and became a world climbing champion at 16. The now 24-year old says that although the Cerro Torre climb was not the most difficult he’s done, it was the “most meaningful.” He states that this trip in particular taught him a lot about himself and his values. According to Lama, the risks you take and don’t take while climbing a mountain help define who you are in life. He also revealed this trip helped officiate his transition from competitive climbing to the more natural and self-sufficient form of alpine climbing.</p>\n<p>In many ways, Lama’s story in respect to climbing the Cerro Torre is one of self-fulfillment. He stresses that making the decision, although dangerous, wasn’t very difficult for him because he firmly knows that climbing is his passion in life, so he was willing to take the risk most other people wouldn’t, those who are content to “go to a climbing gym.” For Lama, the troubles and hardships come with the territory because he knows the feeling at the end will be worth it, which is a feeling most people may not ever know.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Metcalf is the professional face of the group. Responsible for publicity and festival submissions, “she does the talking to people thing,” as Mersel puts it. She’s also the one who got Mersel to apply for the program, and she’s the one who was interested in documentary filmmaking from the get-go.</p>\n<p>“I had an odd inclination into some documentary things, but Blue Horizons solidified that direction,” Metcalf said, her light brown hair tucked behind the ears. “It’s nice to have a channel within the film world.”</p>\n<p>Within the program, the trio worked alongside nine other students in a classroom setting. Three courses were required: one lasting the whole nine weeks, the others lasting six and three. Taught by documentary experts Richard Hutton, Michael Hanrahan and LeeAnne French, the classes were a crash-course in all things environmental science and filmmaking. Guest speakers delivered lectures, and this is how Friedman rolled into the picture.</p>\n<p>“[You knew he was] a cool dude. He was wearing a company t-shirt and his bathing suit, and he was like, look at my Tony Stark drawings of my mussels on the rope,” Mersel said. Just like Ironman, Friedman brought blueprints of his special harvesting techniques to show the class.</p>\n<p>Friedman is the only fisherman in California who uses a mussel fishing technique so sustainable it actually cleans the water. But because very little fishermen have seen this technique in the nation, obtaining permits is difficult, and the difficulty has the potential of wrecking the Mussel Man’s entire livelihood.</p>\n<p>“Organizations are hesitant and want him to do all these studies. So he’s wasting all this money,” Mersel said. The film places Friedman as a character intertwined in a larger issue: the importance of finding sustainable animal protein sources.</p>\n<p>As the film details through its numerous interviews, by 2050 there’s expected to be a massive shortage of animal protein. “We kill animals and put them on trucks — it’s polluting our world,” Metcalf said.</p>\n<p>Within this larger framework, Friedman’s sustainable technique serves as a road map to environmentally-friendly food consumption. And just like that, the trio nailed the conflict and resolution for their narrative story.</p>\n<p>Except it wasn’t that simple. Because of Friedman’s modesty — the man is a literal genius, the only one in California to produce mussels in a clean way, and he’s humble as can be — and because of his reluctance to trash talk permit organizations, the filmmakers had to dive deep to unravel the conflict.</p>\n<p>“We kind of imposed ourselves on his family,” Metcalf said. “Which they were okay with. We definitely spent a lot of time hanging out with them and talking to them and getting him to be comfortable talking to us with the camera. Normal people are not comfortable when you stick a camera in their face.”</p>\n<p>Interviewing turned out to be a lengthy process, and the team shot their last bit of footage three days before the project screened at Pollock Theater. That left less than 72 hours to finish editing.</p>\n<p>Seventeen-hour days are notorious in the world of filmmaking, and students in Blue Horizons are no exception to that rule. For the last 10 days before showtime, most hours were spent in the editing room. “We’d get to the editing room at 9 a.m. and we’d leave at 4 a.m.,” Mersel said, to which Metcalf added. “And then we’d come back in at 8 a.m.”</p>\n<p>But the work paid off, and culminated in an invaluable experience for Metcalf, Mersel, Schmidt, Friedman and the Santa Barbara fishery community. Mersel’s mom, aunt and grandma came to the screening, along with Metcalf’s dad and a whole crew of supportive fishermen.</p>\n<p>Blue Horizons films grow in reputation each year, but “Mussel Man” blew it out of the water. The extended profile documentary was selected for three prestigious film festivals: Santa Barbara International Film Festival, San Francisco Ocean Film Festival and the San Luis Obispo International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing that the documentary was to play at SBIFF, the mussel man responded in a characteristically appropriate way for a man of few words: “Great. I’ll have to bring my pen.”</p>\n<p>To find out more about Blue Horizons, go to <a href=\"http://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/emi/blue-horizons\">carseywolf.ucsb.edu/emi/blue-horizons</a>.

In retrospect, my biggest regret was sitting through a meeting that could possibly be interpreted as the student body legitimizing her appointment as UC President.</p>\n<p>Most disappointing, though, was Janet Napolitano’s outright refusal to host a public forum for all students, choosing to instead meet discreetly with less than one percent of the UCSB student population. As students marched outside on Nov. 21 and 22 with the hopes of catching a glimpse of Janet Napolitano, it became more and more apparent that the voice of the students is not something she takes an interest in.</p>\n<p>Our new UC President began with full control over the conversation and directed us to answer this question: “If you were the UC President and you were in my position, what issues would you prioritize?” This initially seemed like an ideal situation — a system controlled by the very people feeling the repercussions of massive tuition hikes and oppressive policies.</p>\n<p>Yet as the meeting progressed, I became aware that Napolitano was giving no legitimacy to the students’ voices. Napolitano did not sympathize as students attempted to hold her accountable for her policies during her term as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, merely justifying her actions and policies instead of moving forward.</p>\n<p>One student felt compelled to thank her for her “service” to this country — a privilege in itself. While she was building her reputation as Secretary of the DHS through her “service,” others who lived under her policies suffered the traumatic repercussions of countless deportations and unprecedented surveillance. While those who are privileged enough to live comfortably dared to thank Janet Napolitano for her “service,” other students bravely managed to come face-to-face with the human being that was responsible for the deportation of their own family members.</p>\n<p>Hopes for a more affordable, accessible UC system under her leadership were completely shattered by the end of the meeting. Napolitano showcased her disregard for a tuition-free campus in accordance with the UC Master Plan, saying that hope for the “old model” was long gone.</p>\n<p>The Master Plan, a very realistic and “tangible” action plan for the UC system, was drawn up in 1960. The idea of a free, accessible education for all Californians, regardless of race or class, became a force for change in society. However, this revolutionary plan for education — what should be the pinnacle of any democratic society — has been disregarded by UC Regents for decades and, as a result our university has turned into the privatized system we know all too well.</p>\n<p>Indifference towards one of the most profound proposals for free and accessible education is only furthered by our Associated Students’ proposal to “re-envision” a Master Plan that would fix the failures of a broken system. What we have come to know is a UC system that has been increasingly privatized and is far from mirroring the demographics of the state. In fact, acceptance of various marginalized communities has stagnated or dropped at every UC campus in the past two decades.</p>\n<p>Rather than receiving suggestions for a more accessible and equitable education system, Janet Napolitano’s interrogative demeanor pressured students to look for alternatives within their own pools of resources. This was particularly evident when asked about institutionalized retention centers and programs for struggling students of color. Her response, or lack thereof, led me to believe that this meeting was merely intended as a means to publicize her “accessibility” as the new UC President and to justify her crimes and policies of white supremacy under the Department of Homeland Security. Her failure to address the issues that students of color face with honesty is a reminder of her qualifications as a politician and not as an educator.</p>\n<p>Another student brought up the negative effects of the increasing police presence on campus, an ironic remark, considering her extensive coordination with the police at that very meeting. Napolitano attributed the racial profiling and racism in the UCPD to the lack of “police training.” Yet she failed to mention that during her reign over the DHS, she led one of the most aggressive deportation efforts in the United States — a campaign that has made people across this country, and specifically on this campus, feel targeted and unsafe. Secure communities, the “If You See Something, Say Something” campaign and the aggressive border checkpoints are direct examples of her policies that promoted racial profiling.</p>\n<p>It was not only her domestic policies that she justified — Napolitano failed to recognize the coerced compliance in policies of imperialism, violence and colonization abroad, which brings to question her role as a leader in a system intended to be critical of systems she has built her reputation off of. The meeting ended with students expressing personal recollections of feeling physically unsafe on this campus, led by organizations such as Stand With Us and the Anti-Defamation League. Yet Janet Napolitano avoided the question (a common trend during the meeting), referencing instead her preference for “free speech” in these situations.</p>\n<p>I left the meeting feeling further marginalized and angry, but mostly disappointed. Any preconceived notion of higher learning in the UC system was diminished. I came to this campus hoping to be educated on issues plaguing various communities in this country. Instead, I give legitimacy to government practices through Janet Napolitano, I invest in the military and prison industrial complex and I am entangled in two of the largest nuclear weapons facilities in the United States. We hope to leave college with a diploma and decolonized minds, but we sometimes forget the true privilege and responsibility of being a part of such a prestigious university. Janet Napolitano’s appointment is just another way in which the UC system has legitimized white supremacist, racist and imperialist policies. We can no longer be compliant with the institution that is meant to educate and decolonize, which is why the resignation of Janet Napolitano is the only right answer.</p>\n<p><em>Kat A. is a fourth-year political science major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus or UCSB.
