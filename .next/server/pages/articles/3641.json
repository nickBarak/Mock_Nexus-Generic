And that’s worked for them for a long time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lobby Corps has a message for those legislators: UCSB students are not stupid,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristin Hsu, the external vice president of statewide affairs, has helped Lobby Corps prepare postcards asking students to “Fund the UC.” The postcards detail students’ demands and concerns and will be delivered to the state legislature at a conference next month, Hsu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What are the UC Regents expecting out of state students to sacrifice to pay for this tuition increase? The answer is physical and mental health, academic success, food and housing security,” Hsu said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, UC students are forced to pay for conflicts and disagreements among UCOP, the UC Regents, and the state legislature that we have no control over. That is an absolute shame,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents will vote on an additional 2.7 percent tuition increase for in-state residents in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lobby Corps Internal Director Mayela Morales and other UCSB students attended the public forum of Wednesday’s Regents meeting to protest the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might’ve lost with out-of-state students this time, but we also have the proposed in-state tuition increase coming up in the May Regents meeting,” Morales said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morales said that she plans to lobby representatives in Sacramento to “allocate the sufficient funding to the UC system in order to buy out the tuition hikes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an issue that needs to be targeted through various tactics, but we have to remember that if it has been stopped before, we can do it again,” she added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

About $2.429 billion would come from changing the income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, $1.72 billion from eliminating Public Service Loan Forgiveness and $1.5 billion from eliminating subsidized loans, according to data from the Trump Administration.</p>\n<p>Currently, the government pays interest on subsidized student loans while students are in school or the loans are in deferment. If the changes in the new budget are enacted, the federal government would only offer unsubsidized loans.</p>\n<p>The budget suggests “streamlining”  IDR plans for student loans and altering the cap on the percentage of income for these plans and the length of payment.</p>\n<p>Currently there are several IDR plans dependant on income.</p>\n<p>Under the suggestions laid out in the budget, repayment would be capped at 12.5 percent of discretionary income, and balances would be forgiven after 15 years of repayment for undergraduates and after 30 years for graduate students.</p>\n<p>The proposed changes would “focus assistance on needy undergraduate student borrowers instead of high-income, high-balance graduate borrowers.”</p>\n<p>These new conditions would apply only to students borrowing loans beginning July 1, 2019, and would not apply to students who are already using student loans from the federal government.</p>\n<p>The budget also encourages Congress to pass a law that would make colleges and universities assume some of the financial risk associated with student loans.</p>\n<p>The budget also suggests changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.) and CalFresh, which is California’s version of the program. A portion of the monetary benefits that program recipients currently receive would be replaced with a box of food.</p>\n<p>Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), compared the proposed program to Blue Apron, the meal delivery service, at a press briefing.</p>\n<p>Mulvaney said it would cause “tremendous” cost savings.</p>\n<p>“It lowers the cost to us because we can buy prices at wholesale, whereas they have to buy it at retail. It also makes sure that they’re getting nutritious food,” he said.</p>\n<p>The reforms to S.N.A.P. would save about $17 billion, according to numbers the OMB produced.</p>\n<p>UCSB students who receive benefits from CalFresh would be impacted by the proposed changes.</p>\n<p>Rodolfo Herrera, the coordinator of the A.S. Food Bank, said the average student at UCSB receiving CalFresh benefits received about $150 per month.  He noted, however, that the amount students receive varies significantly.</p>\n<p>He added that international and undocumented students are not able to receive these benefits.</p>\n<p>He said the freedom of students to purchase foods from CalFresh is “really important” because recipients can use it to buy foods that don’t require a lot of cooking or processing, which he noted would matter especially to students preparing for finals or midterms.</p>\n<p>According to data provided by Herrera, CalFresh sales at the Isla Vista Food Co-op totalled $52,930 in 2015 and $68,000 in 2016.</p>\n<p>Herrera said the logistics of implementing Trump’s proposed program would be difficult, including storing large quantities of food and even keeping up with people’s addresses.</p>\n<p>“The big system programs that we have for supplemental nutrition for low-income families have been established for a few decades already. The logistical aspects of it are already in place,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 4 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hayleytice/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hayley Tice</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hayley Tice serves as data editor for the 2020-21 school year.

And I shouldn’t be forced to pay money to a union if I don’t think it does a good job representing my interests.”</p>\n<p>Tom Steel, a third-year philosophy, ethics and public policy major and Teamster 2010 Student Organizer, said <em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME </em>would allow non-union members to “free-ride off the negotiating efforts of the union that everybody else pays into,” because labor unions are legally bound to represent them.</p>\n<p>Steel explained that non-unionized workers currently pay fair share fees that cover the cost of the bargaining contract that the workers benefit from, and that the case would make it so that individuals not represented by a union would no longer have to pay fees.</p>\n<p>“Free riders still have to be represented by the union. So if the free-riders have any grievances or any other issues like that, the union still has to expand resources to cover those members, even though those free-riders do not pay anything into the union whatsoever,” he added.</p>\n<p>Public sector union laws differ slightly from private sector unions, Young said. Public sector unions are funded by taxpayers, while private sector unions are funded by business entities.</p>\n<p><em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em> would affect public sectors unions. Private sector unions would not be similarly affected.</p>\n<p>“There’s two sets of labor laws. One way to think of it is the private sector is governed by a national labor law, whereas the public section is done state by state. We fall under the California State Labor Law Code, the teamsters who work at UCSB and other unions too,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Teamsters 2010 is statewide and covers all 10 UC campuses as well as the CSU campuses, according to Young.</p>\n<p>Young explained that when a similar law was passed in Wisconsin recently, public sector workers’ wages immediately decreased, and even the non-unionized workers saw their wages go down.</p>\n<p>“This just really hurts the whole economy because here at UCSB we’re the largest employer in Santa Barbara. Undercut my wages, then I’m not going to be able to shop locally, right, I’m just going to have to subsist on the bare minimum,” he said.</p>\n<p>Right now, unions act as a check on workplace safety issues and workplace discrimination, Steel said.</p>\n<p>“[Unions are] able to do that because they have the financial resources to provide resources for their members, to provide legal guidance to establish a fair and equitable workplace,” he said. “If the unions lose this financial backing, because free-riders won’t pay into the union, not only will they lose their strength, but this check on the employer is going to be diminished.”</p>\n<p>He explained that if <em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em> is passed, employees could face challenges similar to those from the late 1800s and early 1900s, where “employees did not have a voice that was able to combat the whims of the employer.”</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that this would weaken unions, and it would diminish the roles that unions have in their ability to protect their workers,” Steel said.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court will hear opening arguments for the case on Feb. 26.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 15 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
