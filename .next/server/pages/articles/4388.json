The I.V. community has witnessed several movements in favor of cityhood, but the state ultimately determined these efforts to be politically and financially infeasible.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury determined that a CSD would be the best option to represent the unincorporated community.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 (AB-3) was introduced to the state assembly in 2014 and would effectively create a new government in I.V. capable of addressing the needs of the “transient student population” and its “predominantly renter-oriented” community.</p>\n<p>The bill also assigns the CSD powers to provide services related to infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security and roads. Governor Jerry Brown signed AB-3 into law on Oct. 7, 2015, paving the way for Measure E to be on the ballot in Nov. 2016.</p>\n<p>Measure E was the ballot measure to formally create the Isla Vista CSD and was coupled on the ballot with Measure F, a utility user tax meant to fund the district through an 8 percent tax on gas, water, electricity, sewage and garbage disposal for users in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>CSD Financial Strains</strong></p>\n<p>While most of the country focused on welcoming and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-09/over-1000-uc-santa-barbara-students-protest-in-isla-vista-after-trump-elected-president/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protesting</a> a new president on Nov. 9, 2016, I.V. residents also saw the birth of a new government by voting a resounding 87.52 percent “yes” on Measure E.</p>\n<p>The measure created the Isla Vista CSD with voters electing Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan as directors to lead the newly formed government.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman described the district as an “experiment” in providing small-scale government that has the “visceral” ability for students to become involved because of its relationship with UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Measure F, however, received 61.22 percent of the total vote in favor, failing to reach the two-third (66 percent) vote necessary to impose the tax. This effectively left the CSD fundless and with little ability to finance the services it wished to provide.</p>\n<p>The failure to pass this tax is worrisome for the future of the district, as AB-3 stipulates that “the district would be dissolved” if a utility user tax is not passed by Jan. 1, 2023.</p>\n<p>CSD board chair Ethan Bertrand, however, remains confident in its future.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> Tuesday, Bertrand said there are plans to put the tax on the ballot once more in June or November of next year. He also said the district has received approximately $6,500 in funding from private donations, grants and contributions from Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p><strong>Establishing Governance</strong></p>\n<p>The CSD held its <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-08/george-thurlow-joins-csd-on-first-day-of-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first meeting in March</a> and has been meeting every two weeks since then.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the district tries to make its meetings “as interactive as possible” because it works with all aspects of the community, including students, families and businesses.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of the beauty of a small government that we have the ability to kind of work directly with [the public],” he said.</p>\n<p>I.V. now has two entities directly governing it: the Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD), a small body established in 1972 to regulate parks and other outdoor spaces, and the CSD, a body with broader governing powers.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the administrative framework took a long time to build but said he feels the CSD is now “getting [its] wings” as it begins to provide services.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals of the CSD</strong></p>\n<p>According to Bertrand, public safety is “the top priority,” as the CSD is working with UCSB to acquire this year’s $200,000 in annual funding for the next seven years. The university <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-06/ucsb-pledges-1-4-million-to-isla-vista-self-governance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pledged</a> this funding during the district’s creation for “mutually agreed-upon projects, programs and services.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand said he is in interested in “community-oriented policing services” rather than placing sworn officers on the streets. He said he believes this will solidify the relationship between residents and law enforcement and will contribute to a decline in the amount of sexual assault in I.V., which has<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/sexual-assault-reports-up-in-i-v/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> increased in recent years</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to that sum, the district is applying for a $20,000 grant with the James S. Bower Foundation, a local philanthropy, and acquired $3,000 from the Fund for Santa Barbara for “community programming.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, the district plans to use the funds to schedule community meetings at the Community Conference Room in I.V., currently used for CSD meetings, and loan it to organizations interested in gathering there.</p>\n<p>Freeman said the room can only be used for noncommercial purposes but said the district will not focus on the content of the meetings that happen there. Managing the room’s scheduling would be the first service the CSD provides since its creation.</p>\n<p>The CSD created an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/new-csd-interns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internship program</a> in conjunction with UCSB’s political science department in Spring Quarter, employing five interns to-date, but has not yet provided large-scale services to I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>The district’s ability to provide services has been bogged down significantly by its lack of funding, as well as its lack of structure, as it has spent several months drafting policies and developing procedures to follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Hopes</strong></p>\n<p>As the CSD continues to develop and find new funding sources for the services it intends to provide, its directors express optimism toward the newborn government’s future.</p>\n<p>Bertrand said the CSD was created to make I.V. a safer place and to give the community the “long-deserved voice” within local government.</p>\n<p>“This is a huge step for participatory government in I.V.,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD meets every second and fourth Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Conference Room on 970 Embarcadero Del Mar behind Naan Stop.</p>\n<p>“If you have any interest at all in how society operates, in how all of those services that you rely on everyday [are provided] … even if we’re not the ones providing to you, we are a model by which you can learn how government functions,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, August 24, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The California Highway Patrol will begin enforcing the new traffic light law immediately after installation, which is expected to be completed by Sept. 15. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The County Public Works Department estimates the project will take four to six weeks. The traffic signal at the intersection was first discussed in the mid-2000s as part of the Isla Vista Master Plan, a long-term infrastructure project for I.V.</p>\n<p>County Public Works director Scott McGolpin said Southern California Edison electric company will remove the existing eight streetlights at the intersection within the next week and the new traffic signal poles will replace the streetlight infrastructure.</p>\n<p>According to Lieutenant Steve Larson of the California Highway Patrol (CHP), the CHP will begin enforcing the new traffic light law immediately after installation.</p>\n<p>“People need to realize that once a light goes on, it is enforceable,” Larson said. “If the light is red, the light is red. The bicyclists, the skateboarders, they all have to stop at the stoplight.”</p>\n<p>According to the County Public Works Department, the project costs $300,000. The public works department will fund half the cost and UC Santa Barbara will provide funding for the other half.</p>\n<p>McGolpin described the installation as a “pretty easy job” because it will be completed on the sidewalks, allowing cars, bikers and pedestrians to still use the street during construction.</p>\n<p>The traffic signal will not have sensors but will operate on a timer of approximately 20 seconds. Pedestrians will be able to see how many seconds they have to cross the street to adjust their speed.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said 20 seconds is the approximate time it takes the slowest pedestrian to cross the street at the intersection.</p>\n<p>McGolpin also said the county plans to coordinate with local artists to paint the signal cabinets, similar to those on El Colegio. He said he hopes this will minimize the chance of graffiti on the cabinets.</p>\n<p>The project will be as noninvasive as possible, he said, because the department does not want to damage the construction completed on Pardall Road in 2009. The 2009 construction included the installation of the streetlights and palm trees, as well as pouring new concrete at the intersection.</p>\n<p>“We want to minimize the damage because we did the improvements along Pardall and it would be costly to remove all that,” McGolpin said.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said the county has discussed the project with the Isla Vista Community Network, local businesses, the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate and local residents. He said it also plans to work with law enforcement to ensure a smooth transition to the new traffic signal.</p>\n<p>The plan received criticism from students in February, when former A.S. Senator Alex Giolito created a petition in opposition to the traffic light installation. The petition called for the termination of the project and urged alternative methods of controlling the busy intersection.</p>\n<p>County officials addressed the alternatives, such as additional bike lanes in I.V. or channeling bike traffic more evenly to and from campus from I.V., but they ultimately deemed these solutions “too multilayered” to be practical.</p>\n<p>The county originally intended to install another traffic signal at the intersection between Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Mar but decided a signal at one intersection would create a sufficient break in the bike traffic.</p>\n<p>The county also considered installing a roundabout or a four-way stop at the intersection but determined it would not be able to safely sustain the amount of people on bikes at the intersection.</p>\n<p>“It’s a cultural change, and we’re in the heart of the community,” McGolpin said. “We think this one signal should be enough, and we wanted to have a softer touch on the community since we’re doing a signal for the first time in I.V.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story previously said the stoplight was funded by a grant. The Santa Barbara County Public Works Department and UCSB provided funding. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Aug. 24, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily

Capital Fellows Judicial Program in Oakland, Calif.</p>\n<p>She was elected to a four-year term on the IVRPD board in 2014, during which she said she learned to honor the history of the Chumash who previously inhabited Santa Barbara, understand complexities of a local governing body and deepen her respect for the environment and its history.</p>\n<p>She graduated in 2017 with a bachelor’s degree in history of public policy and a 3.7 GPA. She worked as the external vice president for local affairs and created the<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/beloved-community-conference-in-isla-vista-aims-to-strengthen-community-foster-dialogue/\"> Beloved Community Conference</a>, a conference comprised of 30 workshops, presentations and art exhibitions.</p>\n<p>De La Cruz recommended candidates from the 2016 election ballot as her replacement for the remaining one year and two months of her board seat. Matias Eusterbrock, David Hubbard and Clark Covolo each lost an election last year to fill a separate four-year term.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD provides multiple services for I.V. residents, including a street clean-up project, graffiti removal and parks maintenance.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78944\" style=\"width: 815px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ivrpd.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2124990064\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78883\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78944\" data-attachment-id=\"78944\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/ivrpd-looks-to-fill-board-vacancy/ivrpd-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ivrpd.jpg?fit=1609%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1609,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ivrpd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ivrpd.jpg?fit=196%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ivrpd.jpg?fit=805%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78944\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ivrpd-805x1024.jpg?resize=805%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"805\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ivrpd.jpg?resize=805%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 805w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ivrpd.jpg?resize=196%2C250&amp;ssl=1 196w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ivrpd.jpg?resize=768%2C978&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ivrpd.jpg?w=1609&amp;ssl=1 1609w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78944\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The IVRPD board and staff will be giving their annual tour of the parks on Oct. 7 at 10 a.m. Board members will give the public updates on infrastructure needs and proposed improvement projects.

Community Services District (CSD) legal counsel Ross G. Trindle told the board on Sept. 12 that the California Supreme Court’s ruling in the<i> California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland</i> case could be interpreted to allow citizens to bring a tax to the board.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tim Bittle, director of legal affairs for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and representative for representing Upland in the case, said his<b> </b>group filed a petition in Sept. to make sure the court’s decision did not “open the door to abuse” from local governments, considering how “confusing” the court’s opinion is.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As of Tuesday night, the California Supreme Court has not clarified its decision. The deadline to respond to Bittle’s group is Nov. 26.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If the court agrees with Trindle’s assessment, local governments would<b><i> </i></b>be able to bypass the two-thirds requirement for special taxes.<i> </i>For this to happen, citizens must create an ordinance, gather 10 percent of voters’ signatures and bring the proposal to the county for approval.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If the county approves it, governments would either vote on the tax at a board meeting or an election with a smaller majority than normally required.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Legal experts are skeptical whether the court’s current ruling allows governments to leave some voters out of the decision-making process.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The majority of I.V. Community Services District (CSD) board members have rejected the possible use of this legal quirk to pass a tax.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">George Thurlow, a board member, told the <i>Nexus</i> that he cannot take a position on the tax because of his position as both a UCSB employee and an elected official. He added that he has recused himself at every opportunity to discuss the tax.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Directors Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Bob Geis, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan have all said they disapprove of passing the tax through a vote of the board. Brandt called it “a very clear no.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Director Geis said he is in favor of a user utility tax, but it is not an issue for seven people to determine. He said that “if it’s not the will of the voters,” they would be very displeased with such a decision.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would say that we would want to, in any circumstances, bring it to the voters,” Geis said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In a third-party assessment of the case, the League of California Cities said local tax measures proposed by citizens should be open to the same requirements as those proposed by a local government. The group provided their review of the case to the courts in October of last year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The group recommended that cities in similar situations should “consult with their city attorney” due to the “lack of clarity” in the court’s decision.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Legal experts in the county are currently keeping an eye on the issue but have yet to analyze it in detail due to its tentative nature.</p>\n<p>Mike Ghizzoni, legal counsel for the county of Santa Barbara, said he has read the case and is monitoring it but will not provide analysis until the petition has been granted or denied and the case is finalized.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79004\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79004\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/calif-supreme-court-petitioned-over-controversial-tax-case-a-clear-no-to-passing-a-tax-without-voters-for-csd-members/","id":4387,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4386,4385,4384],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
