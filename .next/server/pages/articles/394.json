Senior guards John Green and Michael Bryson both hit the 20-point mark as the Gauchos nearly doubled the Gators’ scoring totals in the final 20 minutes on their way to a 66-45 win.</p>\n<p>Green’s impressive stat line also included 12 rebounds and an efficient 9-14 shooting from the field. He was one of three starters to knock down a pair of three-pointers on the night, along with Bryson and freshman guard Gabe Vincent.</p>\n<p>After a slow start for UCSB, which trailed 4-0 several minutes into the game, a three-pointer from Vincent began a 14-0 run for the Gauchos as they took control of the lead for the remainder of the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a layup by Green at the 6:35 mark gave Santa Barbara an 18-10 lead, the Gators responded well, going on an 11-4 run to cut the deficit to just one point. However, Green put away the final six points of the half for UCSB including a jumper with 17 seconds left to take a 28-25 lead into the break.</p>\n<p>The first half was a relatively sluggish one for the Gauchos, but they were able to turn that around in the second. A pair of free throws by senior forward Mitch Brewe made it 46-34 with 9:10 to go. Brewe led all bench players from either team with eight points on 3-4 shooting.</p>\n<p>The Gators were shut down for much of the remainder of the game, shooting just 21.2 percent from the field in the second half. A three-pointer by Vincent with just under two minutes remaining gave UCSB its largest lead of the game at 65-42.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos eventually went on to win by a final score of 66-45.</p>\n<p>Despite having seven turnovers in the first half alone, UCSB fixed its mistakes by turning it over only two times over the final 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>Vincent was the third Gaucho in double-figures with 10 points to go along with six rebounds, five assists and a steal. Bryson meanwhile had a solid overall game, shooting 8-17 from the field and picking up six boards, two assists, a steal and a block.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for San Francisco State was forward Floyd Wormley. The senior shot 4-12 from the field to end the night with 12 points, six rebounds and four assists, all team-highs. As a team, the Gators finished an inefficient 15-59 (25.4 percent) from the field, compared to 25-57 (43.9 percent) for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Senior point guard T.J. Taylor didn’t score, but was able to impact the game in other ways as he tied Vincent with five assists for the team-lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to face the University of Nebraska-Omaha in its regular season opener this Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Hawaii earned its fourth consecutive win to improve to 14-9 overall while wins over Cal Poly and UCSB landed the Rainbow Wahine in third place with a 7-3 conference record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Karaitiana finished with 12 points on 5-7 shooting and went 2-3 from behind the three-point line. Tallying a game-high 17 points was senior guard Destiny King, who was most effective at the free-throw line making 9-12.</p>\n<p>Though UCSB finished with one more made field goal than Hawaii, the Gauchos’ offense was unable to score a basket to open the game. UCSB concluded the first half 8-30 from the field and were 1-5 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>It was a frustrating shooting night for UCSB’s top two scorers in backcourt members sophomore guard Makala Roper and freshman guard Coco Miller. They shot a combined 4-23 from the field with Roper ending with six points and Miller with five as the two were responsible for two of the team’s total of three three-point field goals. Yet, UCSB rebounded in the second half shooting 40 percent.</p>\n<p>Unlike UCSB, Hawaii established its offensive presence and was successful as it shot 45.8 percent from the field in the first two quarters. It was most efficient shooting the ball in the first period of Saturday’s game. The Rainbow Wahine registered a 61. 5 shooting percentage and closed the quarter on a 9-2 run to take a 16-9 lead.</p>\n<p>The scoring stretch extended to a 14-2 run to open the second quarter which handed Hawaii a double-figure lead of 22-9.</p>\n<p>Despite the absence of its primary scorers, UCSB’s bench played a pivotal role in its gradual comeback prior to entering halftime. Junior center Je Zhe Newton tallied her first double-double of the season with 12 points and 13 rebounds.</p>\n<p>As Hawaii was in route to widening the scoring gap between it and UCSB, a three-pointer by senior guard Dioseline Lopez energized UCSB’s performance on the court in addition to trimming Hawaii’s lead to a five-point deficit.</p>\n<p>Scoring UCSB’s last six points of the second quarter was senior guard Jasmine Ware. She ended Saturday with 10 points in 29 minutes while going 3-6 shooting the ball and 4-4 from the free-throw line. Still, Hawaii entered halftime with a 31-24 lead.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB in its comeback effort in the second half was junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe. She shot a perfect 3-3 from the field in the third quarter to go along with three assists and six points. Jemerigbe led UCSB in scoring with 13 points.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the third quarter on a 7-0 run which expanded into an 11-2 run in the beginning of the fourth quarter, resulting in UCSB taking a 45-41 lead. It was a high-scoring fourth quarter as the two teams combined for 44 points.</p>\n<p>Three lead changes and two ties occurred within the fourth quarter. Although both teams exchanged baskets, it was Karaitiana that provided the edge for UCSB. Prior to her game-winning three-pointer, she had seven points in the quarter and made her only three-pointers of the game in the final period to help lead the Rainbow Wahine to their 63-62 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to UC Davis this Thursday, Feb. 11 and will face the Aggies in the Bren Events Center at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68000\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68000\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/ucsb-defeated-by-game-winning-three-pointer-in-63-62-loss-to-hawaii/","id":391,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[390,389,388],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set for Final Game of Home Stand, Host Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-20-16_5-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's basketball team is set for the finale of its three-game home stand as it will face Hawaii in the Thunderdome in search of its fourth consecutive win.

During UCSB’s winning streak, she has made at least three shots from behind the perimeter in three-straight games, and is averaging a three-point percentage of 45 percent.</p>\n<p>She is currently tied with fellow Gaucho sophomore guard Coco Miller for third in the Big West in both three-point makes per game and total threes made at a 2.2 average and 38 apiece, respectively.</p>\n<p>Providing a lift on both offense and defense when coming off the bench continues to be redshirt junior point guard Drea Toler.</p>\n<p>In the team’s previous game she tied her career-high of 14 points. Possessing the ability to penetrate and drive to the basket or kick the ball out to shooters, Toler leads the Big West in assists per 40 minutes with a 7.7 average and is tied for third with a 4.3 average per game.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the aftermath of five seniors departing continues to affect Hawaii as its young core of seven freshman and five sophomores continues to learn their roles on the court.</p>\n<p>A graduating class that included impact players such as leading scorer Destiny King and its leading three-point shooter for three-straight seasons in Ashleigh Karaitiana, Hawaii has struggled thus far this season.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine rank last in the Big West in scoring, averaging 58.1 points per game and are second to last at eighth in three-point shooting percentage at 28.1.</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s subpar averages, leading the Rainbow Wahine in a majority of their games has been the team’s only upperclassmen and backcourt duo senior point guard Briana Harris and junior guard Sarah Toeaina.</p>\n<p>Toeaina serves as Hawaii’s leading scorer at 12.3 points per game, while Harris is the runner up at 10.8 per contest. In the team’s win over Cal Poly Thursday night, the two guards combined for 47 points to bolster the Rainbow Wahine’s season-high field goal finish of 57 percent.</p>\n<p>Pacing Hawaii’s great shooting night was Harris, who matched her career-high of 24 points and Toeaina, who finished with 23 points and a career-high six assists.</p>\n<p>Although Hawaii has struggled shooting from beyond the arc, it has been exceptional in defending the long range shot as it leads the Big West in three-point defense with a 26.3 average, ranking just ahead of UCSB at second with a 28.3 average.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos have allowed the least amount of total three-point makes in the conference at 68-of-240 in comparison to Hawaii’s second-place standing of 92-of-350.</p>\n<p>With both teams presenting stout defense along the perimeter, it could be expected that both programs attempt to score most of their points in the paint in hopes of sucking in the defense to create opportunities along the three-point line.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Hawaii will tip-off today at 4 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75047\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75047\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-21/gauchos-set-for-final-game-of-home-stand-host-hawaii/","id":392,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[391,390,389],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jemerigbe’s Game-Winning Layup Earns UCSB’s First Win of Season in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/02.21.15ChristinaDeMarzoWomensBBall1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/02.21.15ChristinaDeMarzoWomensBBall1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe scored the game-winning layup to propel the UCSB women's basketball team to its first win of the season, 61-60 over Cal State Bakersfield on Thursday night.

A total of four Gauchos scored in double figures as the team shot 47.2 percent from the field, 33.3 percent from beyond the arc but had a season-high 26 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“You find a way to win because you get stops,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “When it’s a one-possession game, everything matters. Sometimes as coaches you draw plays and sometimes you have to go make a play, and she [Jemerigbe] made a play.”</p>\n<p>The come-from-behind win improves UCSB’s overall record to 1-2 while the Roadrunners remain winless at 0-2.</p>\n<p>From the game’s beginning, it was Jones with the hot hand, scoring eight of her 13 points on 4-4 shooting in the first quarter. She finished with her first double-double of the season, adding 16 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Bakersfield showed its willingness to shoot the three-point ball early, making 3-6 shots from long distance. A late make from beyond the arc by redshirt junior forward Erika Williams with 19 seconds left captured CSUB’s 15-14 lead to close the quarter.</p>\n<p>Williams was the Roadrunners’ second-leading scorer with 13 points and shot 4-7 from long distance on the night. Overall, CSUB shot 43.8 percent from deep, making 7-16 attempts.</p>\n<p>A total of four lead changes occurred in the second quarter as both teams traded points. However, Bakersfield’s defense managed to limit Jones to just two shot attempts in the quarter, restraining her to one attempt from the field in the entirety of the second half.</p>\n<p>Ending the back-and-forth scoring was a three-pointer by CSUB freshman guard Addi Walters. The perimeter shot was the spark to the Roadrunners’ 11-3 run, resulting in their largest lead of the game at 35-29 to enter halftime.</p>\n<p>Scoring the first points in the second half was a three-point basket by UCSB sophomore guard Makala Roper. Despite a 0-2 shooting performance in the first quarter, she tied Jones for the team lead in points with 13. A reserve off the bench, she finished the game shooting 50 percent from the field and behind the three.</p>\n<p>However, Bakersfield’s ability to restrain UCSB’s plan to feed Jones in the paint eventually led to the emergence of senior forward Batabe Zempare.</p>\n<p>Held to two points on 1-5 shooting in the first half, Zempare scored the Roadrunners’ first field goal of the third quarter. The score prompted Cal State Bakersfield’s 8-0 run which resulted in its 11-point lead of 47-36.</p>\n<p>Zempare would go off for 10 points in the fourth quarter and finished with a game-high 16 points. While her late scoring rally helped keep CSUB in the game, the Gauchos’ Jones did not believe she had lost the battle in the paint.</p>\n<p>“It was easy,” Jones said when asked about the matchup with the senior forward. “But the second half, she did start slipping the screens. I just started focusing on getting offensive rebounds and put backs.”</p>\n<p>Guiding UCSB’s comeback was the scoring outburst of freshman guard CoCo Miller. Scoreless in the first half, she erupted for all 10 of her points in the second half. She was responsible for seven points during the Gauchos’ 14-4 run.</p>\n<p>“She [Miller] got two layups, hit a three and stopped trying to pass it to everybody,” Henrickson said. “She’s a confident kid, she can shoot it.”</p>\n<p>Providing some valuable minutes off the bench was sophomore small forward Taylor Farris as she recorded a game-high four blocks. Santa Barbara’s defense held Bakersfield to a 38.2 shooting percentage and tallied a season-high 10 steals.</p>\n<p>A pair of made free throws by Zempare helped CSUB take a 56-53 lead but a clutch three-pointer by Jemerigbe was the equalizer to force the 56-56 tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended up taking a 59-58 lead after a layup by Roper but were caught inattentively on defense by a backdoor cut and layup by Zempare to hand the Roadrunners a 60-59 lead.</p>\n<p>Due to the new NCAA rule that permits the advancement of the ball to halfcourt after a timeout is called and a score has been made with under a minute remaining, UCSB was able to call a timeout to set up the inbound pass to Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 26 turnovers, UCSB outrebounded CSUB 43-24 and outscored the Roadrunners’ bench 28-15.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is right back on the road at Oregon this Sunday, Nov. 22. Tip-off will be at 12:00 p.m. in Matthew Knight Arena.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66699\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/jemerigbes-game-winning-layup-earns-ucsb-its-first-win-of-the-season-61-60-over-csub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66699\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/jemerigbes-game-winning-layup-earns-ucsb-its-first-win-of-the-season-61-60-over-csub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/jemerigbes-game-winning-layup-earns-ucsb-its-first-win-of-the-season-61-60-over-csub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/jemerigbes-game-winning-layup-earns-ucsb-its-first-win-of-the-season-61-60-over-csub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/jemerigbes-game-winning-layup-earns-ucsb-its-first-win-of-the-season-61-60-over-csub/","id":393,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[392,391,390],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
