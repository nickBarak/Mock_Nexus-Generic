While watching the fire, the officers observed an unidentified male approach and kick the frame, causing half of it to fall away from the fire and continue smoking.</p>\n<p>The officers then observed a 24-year-old male walk up, lift up part of the frame and throw it back onto the fire. The officers contacted the suspect and placed him under arrest for fueling a fire.</p>\n<p>While returning to the IVFP station, the suspect apologized for fueling the fire and told the officers, “This was a stupid thing to do,” and “I was trying to impress a girl.” When the officers told the suspect they were going to be completely honest with him, he said, “Since you are being honest with me, I want to be honest with you; I have some marijuana in my jacket pocket.”</p>\n<p>Upon arrival at the IVFP station, the officers recovered a clear plastic baggie of marijuana from the suspect’s left-side jacket pocket.</p>\n<p>The suspect was issued a citation for fueling a fire and possession of less than one ounce of marijuana. He was cited and released; the marijuana was taken as evidence.</p>\n<p><b>Close Only Counts in Horseshoes and Hand Grenades</b><br>\nAt approximately 12:05 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 17, IVFP officers patrolling the intersection of Camino del Sur and Sabado Tarde Road observed a 19-year-old male staggering westbound on Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP reports, as the suspect was walking, he picked up a plastic cup in the roadway and threw it at the vehicle driving on Camino del Sur, just missing it. When the officers contacted the suspect, they noticed he had red watery eyes, an unsteady gait and a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his person.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Goodness Gracious, Great Ball of Fire</b><br>\nAt approximately 1:50 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 18, IVFP officers patrolling the 6500 block of Pardall Road observed a ball 8 inches in diameter, made of a metal frame covered in cloth, on fire in the middle of the road.</p>\n<p>Reports state the officers saw a 21-year-old male walk up to the ball, grab it, spin it in a circle several times and throw it, causing flaming cloth and debris to be flung into the street.</p>\n<p>When confronted by the officers, the suspect said, “I was just moving it out of the street.” The ball was still in the middle of the street and was no closer to being out of the road.</p>\n<p>The fire department responded and put out the fire. When the officers asked the suspect why, if he wanted to help, he did not call the fire department, the suspect said, “I’m not obligated to.” The suspect had red watery eyes, and was confused when given simple instructions.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><i>– Compiled from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Reports by Jennifer B.

The suspect admitted to having been involved in several fights and told the officers that his shoe was stolen from him. The suspect then explained his level of intoxication to the officers by saying, “I didn’t come here to read a book. Yeah, I’m wasted.”</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Rebel Without a Clue</b></p>\n<p>At approximately 12:22 a.m. on Friday, May 11, IVFP officers enforcing a noise violation on the 6500 block of Del Playa Road observed occupants at the party being uncooperative and throwing beer onto passersby from the balcony.</p>\n<p>Officers contacted a male subject who was holding a beer and asked him for his identification. A 24-year-old male suspect interrupted the officers, demanding they leave his residence and telling the other male subject not to provide identification.</p>\n<p>The suspect began to yell profanities at one of the officers and moved close enough to bump the officer. Another officer moved the suspect away from the officer. The suspect was holding a beer, so the officers checked his identification to verify he was of age and told the suspect to stay inside the residence.</p>\n<p>Shortly after, the suspect exited the residence and continued to yell profanities at the officers. When the officer obtained the suspect and told him he was under arrest, the suspect immediately tensed and refused to cooperate. One small burst of mace was used, which terminated his resistance.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Jennifer B.

After vomiting again, the suspect said to the officers, “I think I drank too much,” and “I was drinking at an ATO party.” When the suspect finished vomiting she had to be held up by the officers in order to maintain her balance.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>‘Is It Against the Law To Be Drunk?’</b></p>\n<p>At approximately 1:55 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 9, IVFP officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed a 21-year-old male walking in the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>The officers watched the suspect kick a plastic keg cup in the road, lose his balance and stumble into a parked car. When the officers contacted the suspect to check on his welfare, they noticed a strong smell of alcohol on his breath and person.</p>\n<p>When officers asked how old he was, the suspect said, “Twenty-two. I mean, I am going to be 22.” When officers asked how old he was now, the suspect said, “I am almost 22, but I am only 20.” The suspect then said, “I am drunk. Is it against the law to be drunk?”</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Bunch of Savages Out There</b></p>\n<p>At approximately 5 a.m. on Sunday, Feb. 4, IVFP officers patrolling the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road observed three males, one 19-year-old and two 20-year-olds, pushing and throwing a bicycle down the street toward the officers.</p>\n<p>The officers stood next to a parked car until the suspects reached them, observing the suspects throw the bicycle and jump on it for approximately 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>When officers approached the suspects, they said the bicycle belonged to them, but they were unable to tell the officers the proper brand of the bicycle. The suspects then admitted to the officers that they had stolen the bicycle from a front yard further down the street.</p>\n<p>The original location of the bicycle was never determined. After all three suspects were positively identified, they were released, pending identification of the victim, and the bicycle was booked into evidence.</p>\n<p><b>Even Drunk Men Don’t Ask for Directions</b></p>\n<p>At approximately 1:55 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 9, IVFP officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa observed a 20-year-old male, walking eastbound with a friend, almost run into a parked car.</p>\n<p>The officers first arrested the suspect’s friend for public intoxication. When the officers asked the suspect what he was going to do now that his friend was arrested, the suspect said he was supposed to stay at his friend’s residence.</p>\n<p>The suspect did not know the address, the street name or how to get to his friend’s residence. The suspect told the officers he was going to “wander around” until he recognized where he was. The officers noticed the suspect’s speech was slurred and his eyes were watery and bloodshot.</p>\n<p>Based on the suspect’s level of intoxication and his lack of familiarity with I.V., officers determined he could not care for himself. During the completion of the paperwork, the suspect passed out and only became responsive after the use of smelling salts.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety. While in the transport vehicle, the suspect repeatedly vomited on himself and the interior of the vehicle.</p>\n<p><i>-Compiled by Jennifer B.
