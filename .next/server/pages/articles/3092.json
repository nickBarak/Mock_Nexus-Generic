Anti-divestment speakers argued that the proposed resolution would marginalize Jewish and Israeli students, while pro-divestment speakers insisted that the current investments have already subjected their community to marginalization. The exceptionally large student turnout forced the meeting to relocate to Corwin Pavilion in order to accommodate everyone, with a majority of the audience remaining at the meeting until adjournment at 5:00 a.m.</p>\n<p>The resolution, titled “A Resolution to Divest From Companies that Profit From Apartheid,” targets seven university-affiliated corporations including Caterpillar, General Electric, Northrop Grumman, Hewlett Packard, Raytheon and Motorola for supporting Israeli military and economic control of Palestinian territories. It calls upon the Associated Students Investment Advisory Committee, the University of California treasury and the UC Regents to divest UC money from each of the companies mentioned in order to defend human rights.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, who co-teaches a course on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with professor Walid Afifi and serves as the executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the resolution might jeopardize the positive atmosphere that UCSB has created for its Jewish students.</p>\n<p>“We as a community have become a place that is very positive for Jewish students. When a campus like UC Berkeley or UC Santa Cruz is now under federal investigation for anti-Jewish activities … we are the exception,” Goodman said. “We are the exception for Jewish students; we are the exception for Muslim students, and for students of all different backgrounds, so I want to keep it that way.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said this resolution does not merely criticize the Israeli government, but instead attacks the state of Israel itself.</p>\n<p>“There’s one tiny Jewish state in the entire world,” Goodman said. “That the resolution undercuts that — and not something that’s simply critical of the Israeli government — is something that’s antithetical to what I believe in. To single out Israel as an apartheid state — if you can’t understand how that would make a Jewish student feel marginalized, I am flabbergasted.”</p>\n<p>Pro-divestment student and second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja countered the statement.</p>\n<p>“As a student who believes in human rights, I believe that without passing this resolution we are marginalizing students,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>Third-year Hani Tajsar, one of the student sponsors of the resolution and member of Students for Justice in Palestine, rejected the idea that divestment or critique of the government was an attack on the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“I find it very disheartening that I cannot attack the state of Israel without being called an anti-Semite,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>Goodman’s co-professor Walid Afifi of the communication department also spoke at the meeting in favor of divestment. Afifi said the Israeli government has broken international laws and should be confronted.</p>\n<p>“In the end, what I think we really need to pay attention to is that we have an occupation … which comes with a rule of law of what is required by the occupier,” Afifi said. “That rule of law has been violated repeatedly in extreme ways, in terms of human rights, in terms of international law.”</p>\n<p>In response to claims that some of companies targeted by the resolution may in fact work to protect Israel, Afifi said he would still support divestment.</p>\n<p>“If companies are both contributing to security and contributing to violations of international law … what I would argue is they should not receive our funding until they stop engaging in the activities that are explicitly violations of international law,” Afifi said.</p>\n<p>Many students in favor of divestment stated that divesting from these companies would not be choosing one side of the conflict but would in fact be an act of neutrality. Some, like student Rosina Saeed, said they were not advising reinvestment in companies that support Palestinian forces, but rather that the resolution advises divestment from the conflict as a whole.</p>\n<p>“By investing in this corporation, we have already taken a stance,” Saeed said. “We are not remaining neutral; we have picked a side.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics major Jake Speyer argued that divestment would be counterproductive to any positive negotiation that could potentially take place.</p>\n<p>“The situation in the Middle East is complicated, and divesting from American companies, simply because they build bulldozers, is not a step towards peace,” Speyer said. “We can be a model for negotiation on this campus … this resolution has already created a divide.”</p>\n<p>Several students standing against divestment took issue with the idea that the Israeli government violates human rights or international law. Some cited the official position of the United States government as an ally to Israel, quoting and showing clips of President Obama giving his support to the nation. Others, like first-year biology major Guy Singer, drew on personal experience, citing certain memories from his childhood in Israel as an alternative to the image of the country as an oppressive regime.</p>\n<p>“I remember walking to elementary school every single day with a gas mask in my backpack — gas masks required by the government — because there was a threat … I remember going to peace rallies with my mother, begging both sides to lay down arms … I remember the bomb shelters, I remember the sirens, I remember the explosions,” Singer said. “The picture I’d like to show today is a picture of Israel under attack.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Liran Braude contested the resolution by recounting his own experiences as a soldier in the Israeli army.</p>\n<p>“Israel is not comprised of only Jews … Jews and Arab Israelis, not only live together, but they are together in the workplace, and even in the home,” Braude said.</p>\n<p>According to Speyer, Israel promotes freedom in various ways, rather than restricting it, including the country’s support for the LGBTQ community.</p>\n<p>“In 2013, the independent watchdog organization Freedom House named Israel as the only free state in the Middle East … This is the Israel we want to share,” Speyer said. “Tel Aviv is the only place in the Middle East where you will find an annual gay pride parade.”</p>\n<p>The majority of the meeting’s discourse remained civil. However, despite constant efforts by the A.S. senators to create a welcoming environment, one student left the building in tears, and there were instances of expletives being directed at speakers. Neither side of the debate seemed willing to concede their stance.</p>\n<p>The Senate authors of the resolution — Miya Sommers and Genesis Herrera — urged their colleagues to table the resolution for one week in order to better understand every component of the issue. In the vote to table, 11 senators voted yes, 11 senators voted no, while one senator abstained, resulting in a tie. The vote then went to Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia, who agreed to table the resolution. Senators will therefore resume discussion on the resolution at next week’s meeting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1469831126\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50706\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50700\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/call-it-deltopia-weekend-beach-closures-confirmed/as_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50700\" alt=\"AS_WilliamZhou\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>WILLIAM ZHOU / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Wednesday night’s Associated Students meeting lasted nine hours, as students discussed a solution to a proposed divestment from companies that allegedly benefit from the “military occupation of Palestine.”</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Academic Affairs Board External Co-Chair Adeel Lakhani said the senate’s responsibility is to actively and critically analyze all perspectives when considering whether or not to pass the resolution, entitled “A Resolution to Divest From Companies that Profit From Apartheid.”<br>\n“Active pursuit of understanding is different from being served arguments or ideology,” Lakhani said. “My main point was that consideration of this resolution should be limited to consideration of this resolution … this resolution does not address how to finally address all parties’ concerns but this resolution does make clear that all parties’ concerns should be respected.”<br>\nStudent Rosina Saeed, a supporter of divestment, said discrimination plays a large role in human rights violations occurring in Palestine.<br>\n“I would like to address apartheid,” Saeed said. “My definition of apartheid is racial segregation, simple as that.”<br>\nIn contrast, Jewish Voice for Peace member Rand Clark said support for divestment and anti-Semitism are mutually exclusive sentiments.<br>\n“A vote in favor of divestment says nothing about one’s attitude toward Jews,” Clark said. “A little bit of discomfort is a small price to pay on the path to justice.”<br>\nRabbi Evan Goodman said the resolution has prompted strong reactions from students who feel personally attacked by the university’s potential divestment.<br>\n“One student I spoke to today, I spent a good hour trying to talk him out of withdrawing from the university,” Goodman said.<br>\nAccording to Meggie Le, A.S. President at UCSD, the resolution has been particularly controversial due to the complex and challenging nature of the conflict.<br>\n“Political issues will always be divisive in their nature, but this one is unique in that it is also alienating,” Le said.<br>\nDue to printing constraints, the full story could not be included in today’s issue.

The event also featured renowned public figures, such as journalist Stephen Colbert and economist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Muhammad Yunus. Over 1,000 students attended the conference, with UCSB students Olivia Wong, Alexander Scarlett and Jack John Amend attending the conference as representatives of nonprofit organization Inspire a Child — which was recently awarded the $10,000 Strauss Grant and officially supported by Chancellor Henry T. Yang.<br>\nWong, founder and executive director of Inspire a Child, said she has attended the conference once before and finds much inspiration and knowledge in participating in it. She said the involvement of fellow university students makes the event capable of producing real public policy action regarding prominent global issues.<br>\n“The most exciting thing [about CGIU] is that I am constantly pushed by my peers, challenged by their resolve and motivated to pursue my solution to the world’s greatest problems,” Wong said. “CGIU is not just a place to talk about ideas. It’s about turning an idea into action — taking that concrete step towards solving world hunger and ending poverty.”<br>\nThe conference included three sessions that targeted the main issues of discussion. One session — entitled “Getting off the Ground: Stories of Starting Up” — featured a panel of upcoming entrepreneurs, who shared their knowledge and experience in launching their own businesses. The second session, called “A Better Future for Girls and Women: Empowering the Next Generation,” welcomed professionals and other figures to discuss the many ways today’s youth can make the necessary changes and decisions to give a brighter future to girls and women worldwide. The last session, called “Solutions Without Borders: Working with Unlikely Allies,” brought together legislators and entrepreneurs to discuss the need for international cooperation.<br>\nAmend said Inspire a Child’s focus on helping youth is beneficial to the overall international community because the welfare of the world’s youth can greatly influence the welfare of the world as a whole.<br>\n“The international community knows full well that a driving force to the end of poverty is universal education, especially towards the younger generations as well as the promotion of women and girls rights,” Amend said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the April 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50799\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50799\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-goes-to-clinton-initiative/","id":3090,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3089,3088,3087],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Executive Candidates  Debate Party Lines,  Local Event Safety","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Election-preview_Jimmy-Chang_04.11.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Election-preview_Jimmy-Chang_04.11.2013.jpg?resize=400%2C408&ssl=1","description":"Yesterday, the Associated Students Elections debate forums for the positions of External Vice President of Local Affairs and Internal Vice President took place at the UCen Hub, with candidates debatin...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Yesterday, the Associated Students Elections debate forums for the positions of External Vice President of Local Affairs and Internal Vice President took place at the UCen Hub, with candidates debating issues such as holding student representatives accountable and increasing safety measures in the Isla Vista community.</p>\n<p>In regards to the forum for IVP, candidates debated issues related to increasing the accessibility of the government body to the rest of the student population as well as increasing the ‘diversity’ and ‘transparency’ of the Association. The IVP is the head of the A.S. Senate, the university’s student law-making body which holds weekly meetings that include distributing A.S. funds and other governmental affairs.</p>\n<p>Later in the afternoon, the debates for the position of EVPLA — which deals with issues primarily related to I.V. — took place. Candidates debated issues such as community-building, legal representation for I.V. residents and better safety efforts for large local events like Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>For the IVP debate, there was discussion of controversial A.S. topics like partisan lines that have sometimes existed in the Senate in past years, and the increasing number of senators resigning from the organization.</p>\n<p>Open People’s Party candidate and current A.S. senator Kyley Scarlet said fostering an inclusive environment requires that the A.S. Senate not become divided on party lines.</p>\n<p>“After we get elected in the spring, we are not from different parties … We are all on the same team, and therefore making the senators realize that we all ran together to make a change — to do something different on this campus — is essential,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>In dealing with the marginalized communities in Isla Vista and on campus, independent candidate for the IVP seat, Martin Polanco, said his personal experience as a potentially marginalized individual has not prevented him from integrating himself into the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>“Considering myself — as Latino, Hispanic or Mexican — I could be part of a marginalized community, but I feel that I’m not,” Polanco said. “I’m in a community, and I’m going to reach out to these other communities to find equal common ground so we can act together and make a difference.”</p>\n<p>As for reaching out to the general student body, Juan Galvan — Democratic Process Party candidate and current A.S. senator — said the association must be proactive in their recruitment efforts and attempts to make themselves more accessible to other students.</p>\n<p>“As IVP, as the leader of the association, I see it more as a facilitator,” Galvan said. “You have to really facilitate and work within, internally first, to create these coalitions among the different [Boards, Commissions and Committees] and create projects together — in order to be more open to the outside.”</p>\n<p>The two candidates vying for the spot of External Vice President of Local Affairs, Kaitlyn Christianson of the DP party and OPP’s Alexander Moore, spoke on a myriad of issues — such as keeping Isla Vista a tight-knit community and pushing for increased safety measures that would protect all residents.</p>\n<p>With last week’s Deltopia still fresh in the minds of students, candidates were asked how they would handle the growing issue of safety and crime in the community.</p>\n<p>Moore, who has worked in Isla Vista as a medical first responder during Halloween, said it is necessary to make law enforcement more accessible to students while also providing bystander intervention training to the community.</p>\n<p>Given the 23,000 residents living in I.V. and mere eight to 12 police officers patrolling the area, Christianson said it is necessary for the EVPLA and other campus entities — such as CSO officers — to better contribute to legal patrolling in I.V. Like Moore, Christianson also expressed the need to encourage bystander intervention in emergency situations.</p>\n<p>Since large-scale I.V. events are here to stay, the EVPLA Office must make efforts to educate the next generation of I.V. residents, Christianson said.</p>\n<p>“You have thousands of freshmen that are going to participate in these events, and their first glance is I.V. on a Friday night,” Christianson said. “I think the EVPLA office needs to go into the dorms and talk to them about these issues, representing I.V. in a positive light.”</p>\n<p>However, Moore’s solution to handling I.V.’s biggest parties is to reduce the amount of out-of-towners and to educate non-local police forces, who are oftentimes transferred into I.V. for these events, on students’ needs.</p>\n<p>“We need to be sure that out of town law enforcement that gets brought in to control these events is sensitive to students’ needs … A lot of times, LAPD and UCPD from other schools aren’t as sensitive to student needs and student rights as they should be. One of the things I really want to do is to make sure that those folks undergo training.”</p>\n<p>The debate also touched on better representing I.V. at the county level and keeping the community inclusive of all residents.</p>\n<p>According to Moore, I.V. has gone through a series of development projects — such as new residential buildings like The Loop — resulting in costly living conditions for students.</p>\n<p>“Those buildings can cost more than $1,000 per bed. I can’t afford those; I know our local community members can’t afford those, and neither can our permanent residents,” Moore said. “Gentrification is a problem in Isla Vista, and we need to manage it by re-evaluating the Isla Vista Master Plan … I really hope not to necessarily combat development, but to really improve on the plans set.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Christianson said the development of I.V. has taken advantage of student residents and local families alike.</p>\n<p>“Most of us have to live in I.V. — it’s close to campus, easy, accessible and we love I.V … Landlords know this and so they take advantage of these students and raise prices,” Christianson said. “There was an eviction of these families on Embarcadero del Mar this year, where they essentially told the families to get out because they were going to remodel and the families didn’t know they were being kicked out so they can raise prices.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the April 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50792\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50792\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/","id":3091,"author":{"id":200,"name":"Arda Jooharian"},"related":[3090,3089,3088],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
