UCSB students and other community members of Goleta were given an escape from midterms, work and stress as The Hub provided a space to enjoy live music and artistic creativity for 2018’s Battle of the Bands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kicking off the show was Frisson, the only band of the night to include a girl on both instruments and vocals. Their steady guitar picking, synth keyboard breaks and cow bell solos truly captured the spirit of Isla Vista: simultaneously chill and exciting. Combining the classic guitar sound with an ’80s-esque synthesizer definitely worked in favor of Frisson by creating an unusual and infectious beat anyone could get down with. Utilizing both the bassist and guitarist for lead vocals, this band gave the audience a variety of tone as well as a contagious case of foot-tapping and head-nodding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up was The Mallards, whose dramatic and confident stage presence caught everyone’s attention before they even started playing. The rhythm created by each member passionately playing their designated instruments incited the crowd to be as equally engaged with the music as they were. Soon enough, everyone on the dancefloor became a sea of bright iPhone flashlights, swaying with the beat of the guitar and clapping to the beat of the drum. In the heat of the moment, drummer Jake Morenc even opted to go shirtless. However, as their music quickly turned from steady to fast-paced, the band’s antics grew more chaotic and exciting, lighting up the entire atmosphere in The Hub. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following those two bands came Milk Drunk, who dedicated their performance to another local I.V. band, RabbitFoot. Jumping right into their first song, this trio set the crowd on fire not only with their fast, loud and fearless sound but also with their confident and carefree stage presence. Drummer Kellan Staninger was seen going H.A.M. the entire performance, not letting the drums breathe for a second while bassist Aaron Kopperman danced all over the stage, enticing the crowd to do the same and let loose. Unlike Frisson and The Mallards, Milk Drunk focuses more on being a punk band with a message, often mentioning controversial subjects like politics and how policymakers have control over things that don’t affect them. In between songs, lead vocalist and guitarist Ethan Jones spoke to the crowd and voiced his disgust for current policies that will affect our adult lives after college and even introduced a song saying, “This next one’s about climate change and how the government’s fucking us.” While Milk Drunk clearly cares about music as a form of creative expression, they also use their platform to spread awareness about important issues they genuinely care about, which, in my opinion, is pretty cool. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Milk Drunk was a tough act to follow, Odd Army did not fail to entertain. Aligning with the metal and hard-rock genres, Odd Army essentially distinguished themselves from everyone else performing at Battle of the Bands with their unique, head-banging sound. During their cover of “Bulls on Parade” by Rage Against the Machine, metalheads and fellow Guitar Hero players sang along loud and proud to the band’s impeccable rendition of the song. While each member in Odd Army clearly demonstrated their amazing musical abilities, lead singer and guitarist Alec Luttrell gave soul to the stage with his multiple guitar solos that seemed to say more than lyrics ever could. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last band of the night was Backwood Bishops, a local I.V. band that combines the sounds of rock, pop, funk and soul all into one. The dynamic musical relationship each bandmate had with one another worked to fully engage and invite the crowd into their funky realm of rock. The highlight of their set was their cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Superstitious,” as everyone on the floor could easily join in to dance and sing along. Although each band that performed had a rock/indie/alternative vibe, Backwood Bishops strayed away from doing the bare minimum and used their passion for R&amp;B to create a unique sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Backwood Bishops finished their set, both the crowd and band members were anxious to find out who won. It was clear that judges Ted Coe (KCSB), Erika Papac (Santa Barbara Bowl), and Christopher Tyng (film and TV music composer) would have a tough decision to make. In the end, Odd Army placed third, Backwood Bishops second and Milk Drunk first. Although Milk Drunk is one of the newest bands in Isla Vista, their passion and love for punk rock has safely secured their spot as top dog and fan favorite. When asked what she thought of the final results and of Milk Drunk in general, second-year psychology and sociology double major Ainsly Rivera said, “Milk Drunk captivated the audience through the energy of the music and the physical performance. The bassist was killing it with the footwork. If it were a legitimate show, I would’ve swung in the pit!”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

This quintet is nearing epic in both its age and discography, and has consistently straddled the lines between country, folk, and alternative rock. Their latest album, <em>All Across This Land</em>, was released on Oct. 2, and was self-described by the band as their “best one yet.” Blitzen Trapper’s national tour promoting the album will be making a stop at Santa Barbara’s own SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club on Nov. 11. The doors open at 7 p.m., and the band goes on at 8, wasting no time with an opener; tickets are $18.</p>\n<p>Blitzen Trapper was formed in 2000, and initially used the moniker Garmonbozia. From inception until 2003, Garmonbozia was psychedelic, experimental, and exceedingly prolific. Garmonbozia was a six-piece which consisted of Erik Menteer, Brian Adrian Koch, Michael Van Pelt, Drew Laughery, Marty Marquis, and front man/songwriter Eric Earley. The band performed shows tirelessly all over the Portland area beginning in 2000. Garmonbozia went through a golden age in 2001, performing incessantly and independently recording four albums, which they sold at their concerts. Whereas most of modern Blitzen Trapper is a cross between alternative country and folk, these Garmonbozia records were closer to experimental in nature, and sounded psychedelic and unmistakably reminiscent of progressive rock.</p>\n<p>A few years and a few more albums later, the band changed its name to Blitzen Trapper. Blitzen Trapper is supposedly a reference to the lead singer’s middle school girlfriend, who had a Trapper Keeper binder with pictures of Santa’s reindeer on it, among them the one named Blitzen.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Since the name change the band has undergone many musical changes. Their very first album as Blitzen Trapper was eponymous, and while it was refreshingly experimental, it didn’t receive outstanding reviews or national recognition. It was not until their second album, <em>Field Rexx</em>, that Blitzen Trapper became commercially or critically successful. This album was a more straightforward rock record, and it drew comparisons to both Beck and Willie Nelson.</p>\n<p>Blitzen Trapper and lead Eric Earley struggled to follow up <em>Field Rexx, </em>and over the course of the next four years they released no albums after deciding not to release two because they were not up to par with the standard they had set for themselves.</p>\n<p>The band didn’t hit its stride again until 2007, when they released <em>Wild Mountain Nation</em>. This album was a new high for the band. It received strictly rave reviews, even making some end of the year “Best-of” lists.</p>\n<p>Since 2007 Blitzen Trapper has existed in a golden age. At the end of 2007 they signed to the ultra-famous indie label Sub Pop. Since then they’ve released multiple albums, all earning fantastic reviews. They performed on <em>Late Night with Conan O’Brien, </em>made a music video with <em>The Office’s</em> Rainn Wilson, and continued to chart high on various Billboard rankings.</p>\n<p>With Blitzen Trapper’s latest album they attempt to make a return to straightforward, bare-bones bluegrass, drawing inspiration from their very first albums like <em>Field Rexx</em> which brought them to where they are today. Attending their SOhO show is a guaranteed treat, and promises to be a modern alternative hoedown.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7zyfArxibk</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/","id":6889,"author":{"id":728,"name":"Joey Goodman"},"related":[6888,6887,6886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Janet Jackson Draws Pan-Californian Crowd to SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Janet-Jackson_SB-Bowl.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Janet-Jackson_SB-Bowl.jpg?resize=616%2C440&ssl=1","description":"Hundreds of fans wiggled their way to their seats Wednesday night, Oct. 21 to witness Janet Jackson take the stage at the Santa Barbara Bowl.

Although the groundbreaking singer had not toured in seven years, Ms. Jackson proved Wednesday night that her moves, voice and impact are untouchable, unforgettable and <em>Unbreakable</em>.</p>\n<p>Jackson began the Santa Barbara show of her “Unbreakable” World Tour with her DJ, playing a slew of feel-good tunes to warm up the crowd. He took the crowd back to the early 2000s with a rotation consisting of The Neptunes, Diddy and plenty of Janet Jackson- featured songs. The concertgoers leapt out their seats as Jackson’s contribution to Beenie Man’s “Feel it Boy” flowed out of the speakers. One fan in particular stole the show as he “vogued” to the beat of Too Short’s “Blow the Whistle” mixed with Janet’s “Rock With U.” Attendee Aron Christian, visiting from San Diego, informed the <em>Daily Nexus </em>that he was anticipating, “The music euphoria [the most]. Nothing else in this world is better than this. Nothing.” The songstress was sure to offer him music euphoria like no other.</p>\n<p>Forty-five minutes later than expected, all lights and music came to an abrupt stop. The crowd roared as the demand to “make some noise for the queen — Janet Jackson” echoed throughout the venue. Three projectors dropped from the ceiling to display the silhouette of eagles flying through dark, cloudy skies before revealing the superstar. The appearance of the Grammy Award-winning artist from behind the projector won shrieks, jumps and wide-eyes. Janet’s set kicked off with her newest single, “Burn It Up” featuring Missy Elliot.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The icon graced the stage with her nine back-up dancers in a uniform of black harem pants, sneakers and gold jewels reminiscent of the <em>Control</em> era. “Burn It Up” transitioned into the dominating record, “Nasty.” The 49-year-old tossed her long brown curls from side to side as she rolled her hips and caressed her thighs to the chart-topping record. Janet continued with segments of “Feedback” and “Miss You Much” before pausing to scan the crowd. Jackson broke back into her set with the groundbreaking and autobiographical “Control.”</p>\n<p>In the first segment of the show, Jackson and her dancers wasted no time in whipping out exciting moves. Living up to her reputation for erotic performances, Janet engaged in hip thrusts as she sung “What Have You Done for Me Lately.” The instant the bubbly beat dropped to “Pleasure Principle” her shoulders bounced, legs kicked and hips twisted recreating the iconic video onstage. She directed the microphone to the audience who instantly shouted “I wouldn’t trust your looks baby if I could.” The attendees’ energy kept the Gary, Indiana native excited as she transitioned to her first number one single, “When I Think of You.” Jackson studied the crowd with her signature smile plastered on her face and inquired, “Y’all remember this? It went number one, because of you.”</p>\n<p>Less than an hour into her set, Janet performed a plethora of up-tempo classics and opted for some ballads. Jackson positioned herself on a stool before singing “After the Fall” from <em>Unbreakable</em>. As the “Poetic Justice” actress transitioned into “Anytime, Anyplace,” she rocked on her stool and sung to the Kendrick Lamar sample in the background. Thirty-two-year-old Terrisha, told the <em>Daily Nexus</em> “Anytime Anyplace” is her favorite Janet song. “It’s just so sensual,” Terrisha said. Ms. Jackson displayed such sensuality as she pranced away from her stool and slithered to the record.</p>\n<p>The “Rhythm Nation” songstress worked her way back to more up-tempo singles, beginning with “No Sleep.” The onlookers received J. Cole’s presence on the screen with more hollering. Janet continued with hit records “If” and “That’s the Way Love Goes.” The performance was accompanied by red lights, smoke and the electrifying moves reminiscent of her 1993 MTV Video Music Awards performance.</p>\n<p>The melody of “Scream” and “Rhythm Nation” took everyone in attendance over the edge. The mixture of the two songs with iconic videos and conscious lyrics served as a reminder that Janet is more than a pretty face, but a revolutionary. Jackson squatted on the floor and glared into the crowd as she finished “Scream” with, “Oh my God, can’t believe what I saw as I turned on the TV, this evening. I was disgusted by all the injustice,” and leapt into “Rhythm Nation.” Over 20 years later, she still mirrored the signature militant moves onstage to perfection.</p>\n<p>Janet ended the night with a moving performance displaying images of impoverished and underrepresented groups. The superstar instructed with her hands to her heart, “Love. It’s all about love. I love you,” and thanked the crowd on behalf of her and her family for the continued support, before bidding the crowd adieu.</p>\n<p>The audience stood in awe before shuffling out of the Santa Barbara Bowl, stunned by the Queen of Pop. Jackson’s newest album <em>Unbreakable</em> is available on iTunes.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

bass filled the room Saturday night at Velvet Jones on State Street, along with black-and-white images of guitar players, some Muppets and an enlarged image of a guitarist flipping the bird at everyone walking in, setting the mood of what was to come.</p>\n<p>Stephen Bruner, well known by his alias “Thundercat,” has been making a name for himself in the last few years by collaborating with well-known artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Flying Lotus. Hailing from a family of world-class jazz musicians, Bruner embraces his jazz roots and mixes them with hip-hop, pop and funk to create a unique sound.</p>\n<p>Before Thundercat took the stage, Brainfeeder labelmate Mono/Poly injected energy into the crowd by sloshing and layering beats and chords together with deep bass. He had the room bouncing up and down after the first song.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Soon Thundercat stepped on stage wearing a tattered black shirt and Mumm-Ra hat — a villain from the Thundercats television show. Following him was keyboardist Dennis Hamm and drummer Largis Miles; the crowd was electrified, chanting “THUNDERCAT! THUNDERCAT!” Without introduction or hesitation, he picked up his rather large, orange six-string hollow-body Ibanez bass guitar and played a quick lick, jumping into “Lone Wolf and Cub” from his newest album <em>The Beyond/Where the Giants Roam.” </em>His unusual six-string bass allowed him to play complex and rich jazz chords in both high and low registers.</p>\n<p>After his first solo, one thing was apparent — Stephen Bruner is a monster. He played licks faster than his keyboard player and was on par with his drummer. With virtuoso-level technical abilities on bass and vast creativity, Bruner repeatedly amazed the audience with his ferocious lines. However, Hamm and Miles showed their own musical chops, playing tasteful chords and rhythms during their own solos. Communication was key to the band’s spectacular performance. Bruner focused intensely on Miles and Hamm as they focused back on him, listening for every chord, rhythm and dynamic played.</p>\n<p>The crowd was grooving; there were a few still bodies, but none remained after the trio played “Them Changes.” By the time the chorus hit, everyone was dancing. Sweaty rockers in Led Zeppelin shirts were bumping into one another, trying to move their bodies in the cramped audience, eventually starting a mosh pit on one side. However, the dancing continued freely on the other side.</p>\n<p>Besides commenting about the heat and how “the mic smells funny,” Thundercat seldom spoke with the audience in between songs. Another time, he mentioned how he was “surprised more people [weren’t] drunk,” commenting that if he was in our position he would be, which got a big laugh from the audience.</p>\n<p>During songs, Bruner would play small bits and pieces of some popular songs from previous albums such as <em>Daylight,</em> and collaborative tracks with Flying Lotus like “Mmmhmm.” He even tried the “Adventure Time” closing theme. A few fans of the show noticed and cheered and laughed.</p>\n<p>As the concert was came to a close, Thundercat, Hamm and Miles thanked the audience for the support and exited stage. Soon after, the audience began chanting “ONE MORE! THUNDERCAT!” in unison. This went on for two minutes, with some people giving up the refrain as others were starting up. To the delight of audience members, Bruner and the rest of his trio returned to the stage and performed a few more songs before singing a goodbye.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNCd_ERZvZM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65365\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/thundercat-brings-special-brand-of-new-age-psych-jazz-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65365\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/thundercat-brings-special-brand-of-new-age-psych-jazz-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/thundercat-brings-special-brand-of-new-age-psych-jazz-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/thundercat-brings-special-brand-of-new-age-psych-jazz-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/thundercat-brings-special-brand-of-new-age-psych-jazz-to-soho/","id":6891,"author":{"id":736,"name":"Ricardo Moreno"},"related":[6890,6889,6888],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
