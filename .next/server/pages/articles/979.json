Iguodala provides defensive versatility to the Warriors starting five, which allows them to throw different looks at LeBron James throughout the series, which could give him problems. However, Iguodala’s veteran leadership might be the most important thing he adds to Golden State.</p>\n<p>He acts like a second coach on the floor by instructing players on where to go and calming everyone down when they start getting too loose with the ball. The versatility he provides is also apparent on offense, where he can play a point-forward role with the second unit or the starters, allowing the numerous great shooters on their squad to run off screens and find their shot. Iguodala has been ruled out for Game 1 and he will be reevaluated before Game 2, so the Warriors will have to make it work with Kevon Looney or Jordan Bell in his place for now. But if he is able to get back on the floor, even if he isn’t fully healthy, his effect on his team cannot be understated.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>KEVIN LOVE: </strong></p>\n<p>It’s weird to say that an All-Star can be considered an X-Factor to his team, but Kevin Love has been up-and-down throughout the playoffs and he was injured for basically each of the last two games the Cavs played against Boston. Love is still in concussion protocol and his status for Game 1 is uncertain, but if he can get back on the floor and contribute, that opens up a lot of opportunities for his team.</p>\n<p>His best performances in the playoffs came against the Raptors, where he averaged 20.5 points for the series and was clearly playing his most confident basketball. More importantly, when Love was an offensive threat that commanded attention, the other role players on Cleveland were able to find their groove and start producing. If Love can channel his play from the Raptors series and stay healthy, he will take some of the load off of LeBron, and the Cavs might just be able to catch the Warriors off guard and give them a challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Sizing Up Each Squad’s Starting Line-Up</em></p>\n<p>Andrew Bishop</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors feature impressive depth amongst their bench players, this upcoming NBA Finals matchup will be centered around both teams’ formidable starting lineups. Of the 10 players who will be on the court when the Finals kicks off this Wednesday, six made appearances in this year’s all-star game, with the Cavaliers’ LeBron James and the Warriors’ Stephen Curry serving as captains of the East and West all-star teams respectively. While this will be the fourth consecutive finals meeting for the Warriors and the Cavs, the position matchups have changed significantly since last season. Let’s break down each of the starting lineups and who they will be facing this year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>POINT GUARD: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Filling out the point guard position for the Cavs will be seasoned veteran George Hill, who is renowned for his three-point shooting abilities. Hill’s shot has fallen off slightly since the start of the postseason, and he will likely have a tough time competing with the Warriors’ Stephen Curry, one of the league’s most heralded point guards and three-point shooters. Curry’s ability to quickly come off screens and drain deep shots will likely put Hill in a tough spot throughout the series, and his PPG average throughout the postseason (24.8) dwarfs Hill’s (9.7).</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>SHOOTING GUARD: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The two guard position will likely favor the Warriors as well, with all-star Klay Thompson facing the Cavs’ veteran J.R. Smith. Like Hill, Smith makes his living behind the arc, leaving more room for LeBron James to do his thing. Smith has shot 36.8 percent on three point attempts this season, and he is known to catch fire when it counts, hitting multiple shots that helped the Cavs capture a Finals victory in 2016. However, Smith will be forced to contend with Klay Thompson, who has been hot this postseason, notching 20.5 PPG and shooting 42.6 percent from three. Thompson is one of the purest shooters in the league, and the Warriors’ offensive system will likely get him multiple open looks, regardless of how hard J.R. plays up on him. While Thompson has a tendency to fall off in big games, if he’s left open, he’s practically automatic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>SMALL FORWARD: FAVORS CLEVELAND</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The small forward matchup will be the one to watch throughout the series. The Warriors will ante up with their star player, Kevin Durant, who has dominated the playoffs with his precise shooting, notching 29.0 [[ok]] PPG. Durant has proved to be a challenge to opponents on both sides of the ball, but he is slightly outmatched by his counterpart on the Cavaliers. LeBron James is arguably the best player of all time, and while Kevin Durant can sometimes hang with him, there is no way to completely shut him down. LeBron almost single-handedly carried the Cavs throughout the postseason, averaging an astonishing 34.0 PPG, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.8 assists. LeBron does it all, and if teams attempt to double him, he has other shooters on the perimeter to back him up. He is a force to be reckoned with, and he certainly has the upper hand in this matchup.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>POWER FORWARD: FAVORS CLEVELAND</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both teams feature small forwards at the four position, with the Warriors starting Kevon Looney, and the Cavs starting Jeff Green in place of the injured Kevin Love. Looney has not done a whole lot during the playoffs, with about 4.5 PPG and 4.9 rebounds, and is mostly just filling in due to injuries. He will likely be outmatched by Green, whose point production helped LeBron get an edge over the Boston Celtics in the last two games of the Eastern Conference Finals. Green has averaged only about 8.3 PPG this postseason, but if he can turn it up during the Finals, he could prove to be even more of an asset to Cleveland.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CENTER: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Golden State and Cleveland fill their five spots with power forwards, operating under more of a “small ball” system. Cleveland’s Tristan Thompson has not lived up to his extensive salary, especially during the playoffs, with a quiet 6.1 PPG and 6.1 rebounds. He will face off against the Warriors’ all-star, Draymond Green, who has been nothing short of studly when it comes to crashing boards, notching 11.6 rebounds per game. Green averages about 11.1 PPG, and while his three point shot has fallen off since the Warriors’ last finals appearance, he is still deadly from just about anywhere on the court.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 7 of the May 31</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83429\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83429\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/","id":979,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[978,977,976],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone","biography":"Not available","articles":[970,979,996,1006,1272,1273,1274,1275,1276,1278,1279,1280,1283,1291,1296,1299,1304,1305,1310,1314,1324,1332,1334,1564,1577,1627,1676,1681,3413,4902,5559,5564,5566,5570,5571,5575,5579],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Pasternack Adds Combo of Freshmen & Grad Transfers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-06-web-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-06-web-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team has added three freshmen and two graduate transfers.

This time it’s Ar’mond Davis from the University of Alabama, who will be immediately eligible as a grad transfer.</p>\n<p>We’ve already seen the value of transfers for the Gauchos with this past season’s talents of Leland King II and Marcus Jackson, both essential pieces to the Gauchos’ bounce-back season.<br>\nUCSB is facing the biggest turnover of the top Big West teams, losing four of their top five scorers to graduation, while UC Irvine, Fullerton and UC Davis are all returning the majority of their top options.</p>\n<p>The incoming freshmen recruits and the transfers will need to step up to the plate and support leading scorer and First Team All Big West guard Max Heidegger and the returning Gauchos if UCSB wants to continue building on Pasternack’s successful first season at the helm. Let’s preview the newcomers and what their contributions could mean for the Gauchos’ next season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>THE FRESHMEN</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Amadou Sow</strong><br>\nThe 6-foot-9 forward from Mali gives the Gauchos a presence down low as rebounding is his biggest strength. He’s got the size to finish plays on both sides of the court with his ability to block shots and finish baskets.</p>\n<p>Sow played for the prestigious Oakland Soldiers AAU squad, playing against top players around the country and holding his own. The physical big man should make an immediate impact for the Gauchos and could be a big part of the rotation.</p>\n<p>Expect him and senior Ami Lakoju to hold the paint down for the Gauchos. With USCB a bit thinner on big men next year, it is possible for Sow to play big minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Sékou Touré</strong><br>\nThe 6 foot 5 wing has the potential to fill the stat sheet for the Gauchos as he has great rebounding and defensive skills. He’ll need to improve his three-point shooting as that wasn’t really part of his game in his time with the Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>Pasternack should try to develop that part of his game, and he has been quoted as saying he believes Touré, “by his freshman year, he will be a knockdown three-point shooter.”It will be exciting to see if he can make that leap this summer and give the Gauchos another added threat from deep.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay Nagle</strong><br>\nNagle’s game is one of the most intriguing because he can give the Gauchos a new dynamic as a solid role player from the beginning. He’s 6-foot-8, shoots threes at a tremendous clip of 44 percent and he’s shot nearly 400 in his junior and senior years alone.</p>\n<p>If he can play some defense, his offensive value should be evident from the get-go. UCSB was 220th in three-pointers attempted last year, and while they shot a great percentage, they did not have a guy who could just let it go at a high volume with a quick release besides Heidegger.</p>\n<p>When Heidegger and Nagle share the court, the defense will be stretched out tremendously by their gravity, so I can see Nagle making an instant impact with his one elite skill of shooting the long ball.</p>\n<p><strong>THE TRANSFERS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ar’mond Davis</strong><br>\nDavis is the newest of the newcomers to the Gauchos for next season. The 6-foot-6 guard will be a grad transfer and will be immediately eligible next season.</p>\n<p>He’s starred at Southern Idaho and was rated the No.6 Junior College player in the country after his first two years there. Since then he transferred to Alabama, where he played pretty well, averaging six points per game in 13 minutes per game.</p>\n<p>He got injured before the start of this season and had to sit out, but if he can recover well, he should be a key contributor for UCSB.</p>\n<p>While he was inefficient in his shooting in his lone season at Alabama, his shot has good arc to it and a quick release, and he was far more efficient at Southern Idaho shooting 45 percent from the field. Davis adds another wing to what should be a position of strength for the Gauchos’ next season.</p>\n<p><strong>Devearl Ramsey</strong><br>\nRamsey is a 5-foot-10 guard who transferred from the University of Nevada in 2017. He’s been on campus for a year already, so he should be used to playing with the team.</p>\n<p>He was a top recruit out of high school and shouldn’t be surprised to start for the Gauchos, especially if Coach Pasternack favors Heidegger in the off-ball guard role he often played next to Gabe Vincent last year.</p>\n<p>He should replace some of the Gauchos’ playmaking needs even if he does come off the bench. The Gauchos are losing over 10 assists per game from the graduating seniors, and Ramsey’s game favors getting his teammates the ball, even reaching nine assists in a single game at Nevada.</p>\n<p>One other source of optimism for Ramsey is the success of former Nevada teammate King last year. If Ramsey can make half as much of an impact as King did last year, then the Gauchos should be very happy.</p>\n<p><strong>The Wrap-Up</strong></p>\n<p>The Gauchos may look different, but don’t count them out for a similarly strong showing in Pasternack’s second year at the helm. Heidegger returns as one of the best gunners in college basketball and should be a strong favorite to win Big West player of the year after he was robbed of the award this time around.</p>\n<p>While key contributors like King and Vincent are gone, Pasternack has rebuilt this team with a focus on athletic swingmen. Expect the Gauchos to have a quick, switchy defense and to be more perimeter-focused next year.</p>\n<p>We know guys like Heidegger, Nagle and the other newcomers in the backcourt can hit shots from outside, but the key for the Gauchos to reach a high ceiling could be their frontline headlined by the freshman Sow and senior Lakoju. If they can rebound well and protect the rim, Pasternack will have a plethora of offensive talent coming back the other end.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 3rd</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82855\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/pasternack-adds-combo-of-freshmen-grad-transfers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82855\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/pasternack-adds-combo-of-freshmen-grad-transfers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/pasternack-adds-combo-of-freshmen-grad-transfers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/pasternack-adds-combo-of-freshmen-grad-transfers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/pasternack-adds-combo-of-freshmen-grad-transfers/","id":976,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[975,974,973],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Warriors Vs.

I mean, the man in question has reached the pinnacle of<br>\ncompetition in every season for the past eight years. LeBron James’s jersey sales are impeccable and he<br>\nsets a precedent for every young baller. Not only is James’s character one to look up to, but his work<br>\nethic is that of a champion.</p>\n<p>LeBron himself, however, doesn’t have the entertainment factor to support the entire NBA. What<br>\nshines from Jordan is the fact that during his six years competing in the NBA Finals, average viewership<br>\nwas the highest it&amp;#39;s ever been, barring the 1987 Lakers-Celtics, Magic-Bird, rivalry matchup.</p>\n<p>Yet the NBA was plagued after Jordan’s final championship appearance. Come 1999, average<br>\nviewership slipped to just above 11 million after reaching nearly 19 million average viewers in 1998<br>\nfollowing a steady rise in the recent five years. Since Jordan, average viewership in the NBA Finals<br>\nremains low, with the ceiling reaching 12 million viewers in 2001, 7 million less than the NBA’s peak in<br>\n1998, the last time the G.O.A.T. competed.</p>\n<p>As LeBron’s championship woes continued in Cleveland, following his first appearance in the Finals<br>\nwhich culminated in a devastating sweep in 2007, average viewership curbed to approximately 6 million<br>\naverage viewers, the lowest it’s been in over 40 years throughout the entire modern NBA era.<br>\nThe King finally got a taste of a ring in Miami, a flavor he so longed for his hometown fans to indulge in.<br>\nYet as he shifted gears back to Cleveland, a new duo of stars emerged in the West: cue the Splash<br>\nBrothers.</p>\n<p>Steph Curry and Klay Thompson brought significance to NBA level competition by reinventing the<br>\ngame. Kids want to emulate Curry’s shot. Players want to resemble the impact that the Splash Brothers<br>\nhave on a game when they are healthy. LeBron displays superhuman athleticism and strength, but the<br>\nWarriors make it look relatable — they have fun playing this game. LeBron’s jersey sales are impeccable<br>\n… but Steph Curry’s are off the charts.</p>\n<p>And it’s no surprise that the top two teams in merchandise revenue are those two that have been in the<br>\nNBA Finals for each the past four seasons.<br>\nOver the past three years, the average viewership has reached its height since 2001. Fans love to see<br>\na plethora of talent displayed in the championship games, but LeBron’s team seems to lack the star<br>\npower that we’ve seen in the past. Similarly, over the past three years, average viewership has declined<br>\nfrom 2015.</p>\n<p>Viewership peaked when Steph and Klay shocked the world in 2015 by dropping the King. Followed by<br>\na slight decline in viewership in 2016, Lebron and Kyrie bounced back and dropped the best record the<br>\nNBA had ever seen. 2017 brought Kevin Durant and suddenly the outcome became as predictable at the<br>\nstart of the year as it was at the end as viewership once again dipped during the 5-game series.</p>\n<p>The NBA’s motto is “Where Amazing Happens,” but if the result is gradually and increasingly far from<br>\nmysterious, is the NBA really “amazing” anymore?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Can the One Man Army Win It All By Himself?</em></p>\n<p>Brandon Victor</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What else is there to say about LeBron James that we haven’t already heard? Despite thousands of minutes on his 33 year old body, despite all science suggesting he should be slowing down, the King continues to get better and more efficient, culminating in arguably the finest postseason of his career.</p>\n<p>Once again, LeBron James has defied all logic this postseason, carrying a team of washed up stars that likely would have gotten swept by the Pacers without him to the NBA finals.</p>\n<p>Through it all, LeBron has reminded us why he is the best player in the world. This postseason, despite shouldering a 36 percent usage rate, James has averaged 34 points, 8.8 assists, and 9.2 rebounds while still shooting a remarkable 54 percent from the field. With 13 double-doubles and 3 triple-doubles already this postseason, LeBron has solidified his name in the greatest of all time conversation.</p>\n<p>But can he do it all alone? Unless Kevin Love– who was a minus 18 in the Boston series– comes back from his concussion a brand-new player, he will once again be trying to drag this team of misfits and washed-up players past the finish line. And although LeBron displayed his greatness during the Boston series, he also seemed incredibly fatigued at times, missing rotations on the defensive end that he would never have missed in the past.</p>\n<p>LeBron will still get his buckets against Golden State, especially while Andre Iguodala remains sidelined. Despite the tenacious defense of Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, no player in the NBA can consistently guard LeBron James. While he may no longer have the explosiveness he used to, James has mastered his craft, using his strength to finish at the rim and then coming back and hitting a step-back on the very next play.</p>\n<p>Expect a vintage performance from the King this series– a player who has proven time and time again that he comes to play when the pressure is on. Similarly to 2015– when Kyrie Irving and Love both got injured– LeBron will do everything in his power to fight and claw his way for his fourth title. Unfortunately, just like in 2015, the best player in the world can’t beat a team as deep and talented as the Warriors just by himself.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 6 of the May 31</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83426\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83426\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/","id":977,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[976,975,974],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Pacific, Drops Two Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The doubles point was all-important in the Gauchos last three matches","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62312\" style=\"width: 2787px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis15-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"982205452\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62375\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62312\" data-attachment-id=\"62312\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/2-1-15christinademarzomenstennis15-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2.1.15ChristinaDeMarzoMensTennis15-web.jpg?fit=2777%2C4166&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2777,4166\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Morgan Mays hits the ball across the net to his opponent.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>This past weekend the No. 65 UCSB men’s tennis team went 1-2 in three matches on the road in Northern California. The Gauchos took a 4-3 victory over the University of Pacific in-between a pair of 4-3 losses to conference opponent No. 68 UC Davis and Fresno State. In all three matches, the all important doubles point was the deciding factor.</p>\n<p>With this weekend in the books, the Gauchos move to an overall record of 11-9 and a conference record of 2-2.</p>\n<p>No. 68 UC Davis took on the Gauchos just a day after handing a 5-2 loss to the No. 49 Cal Poly Mustangs. At a 2-0 record in conference and a 7-0 record at home, the Aggies would not take anything less than a win to cap off the season undefeated in Davis.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Aggies started off the match on a good note by beating the Gauchos in the doubles competition. The Gaucho pair of seniors Tobias Galskov and Ziad Sultan was defeated 6-2 while the duo of junior Nathan Eshmade and sophomore Erik Johnsson fell 6-4. The Aggies took a 1-0 lead, meaning the Gauchos would need four singles victories to claim the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly tied the match with a one-sided win from sophomore Morgan Mays, playing on court three. Mays took his eighth singles victory in a row, winning in straight sets of 6-2, 6-0 to put UCSB on the board 1-1.</p>\n<p>Freshman Cody Rakela was the next to finish and his win gave his team a 2-1 advantage in the match. Rakela defeated his opponent on court four in straight sets of 6-4, 6-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were in need of two more singles victories to take the conference match, but fell just short, as only sophomore Teague Hamilton was able to add a win for Santa Barbara. Galskov, coming off of injury was unable to find his rhythm on court one and was defeated in straight sets. Hamilton battled through three sets and won 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 on the sixth court, but it was not enough as the Aggies took the slim victory 4-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB got off to a better start Sunday morning at UOP as Mays and his partner junior Andrew Riminton took a 6-2 win on court three to begin doubles play. The Tigers tied it up on court one and the doubles point came down to Eshmade and Johnsson on court two. In a tie break, the Gaucho duo took a 7-6 win to put their team up 1-0.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Pacific split the singles matchups 3-3 to give Santa Barbara a 4-3 win – just the team’s third on the road this season. The three wins from the Gaucho side came from the same three in the earlier match with Davis.</p>\n<p>Hamilton added his second straight win of the road trip with his straight set victory on the sixth court. He was the first to finish, winning 6-5, 6-2 and put his team up 2-0. Mays followed just after with his 6-3, 6-4 victory. This win extended his singles match streak to nine straight wins and moved him back up to the second spot on the roster.</p>\n<p>Rakela was the one to seal the match for the Gauchos with his hard fought victory on court one. The freshman took the first set 6-4 before being bested in the second 3-6. In the third and final set, Rakela blew by his opponent 6-1 to ensure the Gauchos a victory on this long trip.</p>\n<p>The final match of this road trip was all too familiar at this point in the weekend for UCSB. Once again the Gauchos found themselves in a match decided by one point, and fell 4-3 to a hot Fresno State team. The Bulldogs capitalized on the doubles point and UCSB split the singles matches for the third straight time.</p>\n<p>“It was a tough loss,” Mays said. “But they were a very tough team. It goes to show you how important the doubles point is.”</p>\n<p>Eshmade, who struggled in the two matches prior, finally found his feet while playing away and grabbed a win on the number one court. He took a one-sided victory in straight sets of 6-1, 6-2 to give his team some hope for the overall win.</p>\n<p>Down 3-1 in the match, both Johnsson and Hamilton added wins to the UCSB scoreboard to tie it at 3-3. They both won in straight sets as well going 6-2, 6-1, and 6-3, 6-4, respectively.</p>\n<p>The match came down to the number four court where Rakela found himself down 1-0 and already losing the second set. The freshman battled back to force a tie breaker in the second but was edged out 6-7 to give the Bulldogs the home victory.</p>\n<p>“It’s the last part of the season so this is what matters now,” Mays said. “We just need to step up. We are all really pumped for Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will return home this Saturday to renew the Blue-Green Rivalry against a tough No. 49 Cal Poly team. The Gauchos, who currently stand at 8-0 at home, will be looking to become the first team in school history to post an undefeated home season. The action is set to start at 2 pm at the Rec Cen courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62375\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62375\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/ucsb-defeats-pacific-drops-two-matches/","id":978,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[977,976,975],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
