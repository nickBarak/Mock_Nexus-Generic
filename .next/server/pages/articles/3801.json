The fire is currently 86 percent contained.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire surpassed the Cedar Fire that burned in San Diego County in October 2003. The Cedar Fire burned 273,246 acres, caused 15 deaths and destroyed 2,820 structures.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire is approximately 16 miles from UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The fire line from Ventura to Santa Barbara is “contained and secure” and fire officials do not expect the fire to progress further since wind speeds have slowed, according to a Cal Fire press release on Sunday.</p>\n<p>All mandatory and voluntary evacuations have been lifted in Santa Barbara County, with the exception of a voluntary evacuation warning on Highway 33 between Rose Valley north to Hartman Ranch.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire has caused the death of one firefighter and one civilian and has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged another 280.</p>\n<p>The blaze began on Dec. 4 and its cause is still under investigation, according to Cal Fire’s incident tracker.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vista residents experienced <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/i-v-residents-out-of-power-for-three-hours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blackouts</a> the night the fire began and responded by flooding the streets of I.V., <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/watch-fireworks-and-couch-burnings-from-the-i-v-power-outage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">setting off fireworks and burning couches</a>.</p>\n<p>Air quality in Santa Barbara and Goleta improved to “good” after weeks of the “unhealthy” air quality that prompted Chancellor Henry T. Yang to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/petition-to-cancel-classes-due-to-thomas-fire-gains-3000-signatures-in-one-hour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cancel classes</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/breaking-ucsb-cancels-finals-week-postpones-fall-quarter-due-to-thomas-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">postpone finals.</a></p>\n<p>As many Santa Barbara evacuees begin to return home, county officials are encouraging residents to be aware of hazards caused by the fire, such as downed power lines.</p>\n<p>Residents may also see an increase in displaced wildlife and Cal Fire is urging residents to maintain a safe distance and avoid feeding animals.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire has remained far from Isla Vista and the UCSB’s campus, but students felt its effects as they concluded Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>UCSB opened an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/uc-santa-barbara-gym-will-accept-nearly-200-evacuees-from-thomas-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evacuation center</a> at its Multi-Activity Center on Dec. 5, which held up to 200 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-15/thomas-fire-evacuees-hope-to-return-home-soon-ucsb-evacuation-center-remains-open/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evacuees affected</a> by the Thomas Fire. The university closed the shelter on Friday, Dec. 22.</p>\n<p>Isla Vistans also stepped up during this tumultuous time. The I.V. Food Cooperative provided a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-20/isla-vista-food-co-op-aids-victims-of-thomas-fire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">food donation bin</a> for those affected, raising over $1,000 in donations and offering a 15 percent discount for evacuees.</p>\n<p>Firefighters will continue to patrol the fire’s perimeter and use aircraft to drop water on steep areas with limited access. According to Cal Fire, firefighters intend to remain on standby in case new fires erupt as they work to suppress the Thomas Fire.</p>\n<p><em>Updated Dec. 25 at 10:34 p.m. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80315\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80315\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/","id":3801,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[3800,3799,3798],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[2286,2364,2385,2391,2392,2400,2404,2416,2419,2421,2424,2425,2429,2430,2443,3574,3584,3601,3737,3749,3756,3757,3763,3786,3801,3806,3908,3910,3920,3925,3926,3952,4280,4291,4313,4352,4357,4386,4387,4388,4389,4392,4393,4394,4395,4403,4404,4406,4408,4409,4423,4426,4435,4442,4449,4465,4489,7780],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to several criminal incidents in Isla Vista involving UCSB students, Isla Vista residents and individuals from outside the community.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to several criminal incidents in Isla Vista involving UCSB students, Isla Vista residents and individuals from outside the community.</p>\n<p>Police officers responded to cases including a false report of stolen property, assault, possession of illegal drugs and the sale of marijuana without a license. The weekend began with a report of assault that took place on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies responded to an assault case on 6671 Del Playa that involved a student from San Diego State University and an unidentified victim. Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lt. Robert Plastino said in-field witnesses assisted officers with the investigation.</p>\n<p>“A 21-year-old SDSU student sucker-punched the victim from behind, knocking him unconscious, causing lacerations requiring sutures and breaking a front tooth,” Plastino said. “[There was] no motivation to punch the victim. It was for no reason — out of the blue.”</p>\n<p>The suspect was charged with assault and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail. That same night, officers arrested an out-of-town visitor for indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs at the residence of 6563 Trigo Road.</p>\n<p>“A 20-year-old Claremont resident was observed by multiple reporting parties and incoming deputies to be actively exposing his genitals for gratification purposes,” Plastino said. “He was arrested and also found to be in possession of cocaine.”</p>\n<p>During the daytime on Saturday, deputies arrested Isla Vista local Jamal Blue for selling marijuana on the 6600 block of Trigo Road. According to Plastino, deputies watched Blue conduct a hand-to-hand transaction with a UCSB student.</p>\n<p>“Investigation found that Jamal had provided the student with marijuana. He was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, a stolen iPhone was recovered at Freebirds last Wednesday. He said the victim texted the suspect who was in possession of the phone.</p>\n<p>“The suspect, [a] Freebirds employee, confirmed the serial number and said he had purchased it from a UCSB student,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>When the victim demanded the phone back, Plastino said the employee requested a $180 reimbursement from the victim. According to Plastino, the suspect was eventually discovered to be speaking falsely about the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the phone.</p>\n<p>“The suspect was lying. He had found the phone and was trying to force the victim to pay him in order to get it back,” Plastino</p>\n<p>Plastino said IVFP took measures to detain the suspect, who was found not only to be in possession of the iPhone but also of a meth pipe. With this finding, the suspect was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, April 30, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55089\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55089\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/","id":3798,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3797,3796,3795],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to a series of drug cases, burglaries and assaults last week and over the weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to a series of drug cases, burglaries and assaults last week and over the weekend.<br>\nThese incidents included an intoxicated female subject attempting to remove her clothes, a robbery on El Colegio Road, an intoxicated UCSB student attempting to resist arrest and numerous cases of laptops stolen from residences.<br>\nAccording to IVFP Station Lieutenant Robert Plastino, last Wednesday around midnight, deputies received a call from a woman saying her female roommate was under the influence of LSD, while also saying that the roommate was “out of control” and heading to Woodstock’s Pizza. Deputies located the woman in question at 6503 Madrid Road in Isla Vista, where she told officers more details about her situation.<br>\n“The woman stated she was on a life-changing mission and that her great grandmother just passed away today,” Plastino said. “She also said her life mission is to bring world peace and end violence against humanity.”<br>\nPlastino said the woman alternated between sobbing and smiling “all within seconds,” before standing up in an attempt to remove her clothes.<br>\n“The woman stood up, removed her top and began to remove her sweatpants. Deputies were able to prevent her from pulling down her sweatpants,” Plastino said. “Deputies then handcuffed the woman and asked her friend to put the shirt back on the woman. The friend assisted and helped cover the woman up.”<br>\nAccording to Plastino, the woman was later transferred to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for a complete medical evaluation.<br>\nOn Friday evening, deputies received a call reporting a robbery at an apartment on El Colegio Road. The victim who made the call said he was approached by two adult males while taking out his trash, according to Plastino, who said the victim described the suspects as “two black ‘gangster-looking’ males.”<br>\n“One of the males threw him down and started punching him in the face,” Plastino said, while adding that the victim gave the suspect his full prescription of Xanax, which the victim had inside his wallet in his pocket.<br>\nAccording to Plastino, the property manager of the victim’s apartment complex verified the story as a witness to the incident. The investigation is ongoing.<br>\nOn Saturday night, a UCSB student injured himself while attempting to escape from IVFP deputies while intoxicated, Plastino said.<br>\n“[The subject] was extremely drunk and attempted to run upon contact by Foot Patrol,” Plastino said. “He was chased and caught by two deputies, at which time he sustained an abrasion above the eye.”<br>\nPlastino said medics were called to treat the man’s injuries and shortly after receiving treatment, he was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail for assaulting one of the medical personnel.<br>\nIsla Vista also saw a series of laptop robberies this weekend, according to Plastino. Six laptops were stolen over the weekend — two on Saturday and four on Sunday. On Saturday night, two different laptops were stolen from separate houses on Del Playa Drive, with one stolen through an unlocked bedroom door during a house party while the other was taken from a female victim’s room while she slept. On Sunday, two laptops were taken from a house on Trigo Road from an unlocked backdoor and another two laptops were taken from a residence on Cervantes Road through an unlocked door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, May 14, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55302\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55302\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/","id":3799,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3798,3797,3796],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.
