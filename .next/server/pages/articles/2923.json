The fraternity seeks to establish a chapter on campus to appeal to pre-med students, despite the presence of Mu Delta, a pre-existing pre-med fraternity that has been on campus since 2011, as well as Rho Psi Eta, UCSB’s pre-health sorority, established 2007.</p>\n<p>According to Amy Tsang, Vice President of PhiDE Recruitment and second-year biopsychology major, the fraternity is unique because it is the only co-ed pre-medical organization on campus, differentiating it from all-male Mu Delta and all-female Rho Psi Eta, and includes pre-medical and medical school students.</p>\n<p>“We’re unique to UCSB in the way that we have medical school fraternities, as well as pre-medical school fraternities,” Tsang said in an email. “This means we have a strong alumni network, as well as tied to medical schools across the nation!”</p>\n<p>PhiDE president and third-year cell and developmental biology major Mimi Xu said the fraternity provides members benefits after graduation from college, including assistance in choosing a specialty and finding residency training.</p>\n<p>“We hope this fraternity prepares premeds for medical school by offering many resources such as volunteering and internship opportunities, guest speakers, academic help, etc.,” Xu said in an email.  “We also hope members will create lifelong friendships with people who have the same goals and aspirations, and have a supportive network of people when things get tough.”</p>\n<p>According to PhiDE Vice President of Programming and second-year biology major Kevin Le, the new chapter will require 25 students to join to form the founding class, and there are tentative plans to hold the first rush in the fall quarter of 2015.</p>\n<p>“Students looking to join this fraternity should be ready for a challenge, but a worthwhile challenge,” Le said in an email.  “Joining a new fraternity on campus and building it up from the ground is definitely something that is not easy. However, the potential growth and lifetime bonds you could develop from doing so is what makes it worth it and so exciting.”</p>\n<p>Carl Provenzano, Inter-Fraternity Council president and fourth-year biopsychology major, said PhiDE will offer pre-med students a great way for students to get involved.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great to bring out groups that tend to different demographics,” Provenzano said. “And it’s coed and it targets the medical students. It is definitely official and it’s great that students can find a niche and get involved.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the January, Thursday 22, 2015 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60014\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60014\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/new-chapter-of-pre-med-fraternity-to-join-campus/","id":2923,"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu"},"related":[2922,2921,2920],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu","biography":"Not available","articles":[2306,2519,2538,2547,2568,2923,2959,4812],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Event Honors Michael D.

Young has been at the university with the division of Student Affairs since 1990.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Affairs Debbie Fleming said Young and his wife have made positive and lasting impacts on the university and that Young will leave behind a legacy for vice chancellors in Students Affairs to come.</p>\n<p>“JoAnne has shared Michael with us for the last 25 years, so we are forever grateful to JoAnne and the entire family, many of whom are here,” Fleming said. “Michael Young’s values — honesty, transparency, integrity, collaboration and teamwork — are at the foundation of the positive and supportive community that we treasure at the Student Affairs Division.”</p>\n<p>Marina Quintanilla, a second-year biology major and a student assistant in Young’s office, said Young will be missed by students and staff alike.</p>\n<p>“It is going to be so sad going into the office and not seeing him everyday,” Quintanilla said. “We are used to seeing him meet with numerous people throughout the whole week and he is just very nice and very caring for the students and now that he is gone it is going to be the saddest thing ever.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, along with Assembly member Das Williams, presented Young with a framed resolution to recognize and honor his time with the university.</p>\n<p>“Not only has Michael demonstrated wise and experienced leadership in his position but he has launched countless initiatives that have become the models throughout the country in areas including creation of student wellness programs, an issue of great concern I know to all of us at this time,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Williams said Young has influenced the high voter registration campaigns and turnout at the university.</p>\n<p>“He made it a value,” Williams said, “He made a recognition of the administration that having students and faculty register to vote and participate in our government was an important value to have.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am very proud of what we have accomplished over the past quarter century, and I am proud of my role in all that, but the truth is that it is teams that win championships and it was and has always been the team that has made us successful. So the real and simple answer is that I am most proud of you. – Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young</p></blockquote>\n<p>Williams also said Young was a leader in the move to improve energy efficiency efforts on campus, including the Zero Net Energy Plan, an initiative to help ensure energy efficient spending at the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>“In the beginning of the implementation of the Zero Net Energy Plan, UCSB will be more energy efficient in the years to come and will be more instep with our values so that we are not creating as much human pain by the energy choices that we have as a community,” Williams said, “and that is because Dr. Michael Young thought it was important and helped move that forward.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Congresswoman Lois Capps, whose late husband Walter H. Capps was a professor on the committee that chose Young as Vice Chancellor, said Young has “enriched” the university throughout his career and his “noble work.”</p>\n<p>“Michael, how you touch the individuals, during that formative time in a person’s life, when they are a college student,” Capps said, “That translates into a wider community now.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Michael has treated me as an equal, demonstrating a confidence in me that I hadn’t realized myself yet. Michael supported and helped to instill the strength in me and the entire UCSB community that guided us through a very challenging chapter in our lives. – A.S. President Ali Guthy</p></blockquote>\n<p>Executive Director of Housing and Residential Services Willie Brown said Young was a constant role model to the African-American community on campus.</p>\n<p>“Michael has given his heart when a heart was needed for balance, when a heart was needed to even out the odds,” Brown said. “Michael has been a friend to anyone who needed a friend, he has connected those who have no connection.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Ali Guthy said she first met Young at the emergency response meeting following the shooting in May and that it was during that time that Young revealed himself as a pillar of strength for “the entire UCSB community.”</p>\n<p>“Michael has treated me as an equal, demonstrating a confidence in me that I hadn’t realized myself yet,” Guthy said. “Michael supported and helped to instill the strength in me and the entire UCSB community that guided us through a very challenging chapter in our lives.”</p>\n<p>Young said that among the things he has done during his time at the university, his development of a solar energy sustainability initiative, his support for the LGBTQIA community, his improvements in regard to mental health services and other projects are among those he is most proud of.</p>\n<p>“I am very proud of what we have accomplished over the past quarter century, and I am proud of my role in all that, but the truth is that it is teams that win championships and it was and has always been the team that has made us successful,” Young said. “So the real and simple answer is that I am most proud of you.”</p>\n<p>Young said the Student Affairs Division will be in good hands with current Senior Associate Dean of Enrollment Services Mary Jacob, when she fills his position after his official retirement on Jan 31.</p>\n<p>“Those of you that know Mary know that she is smart, she is committed, she has strict, great values, [and is] a strong person with even stronger principle values,” Young said. “I want to thank you all for being such great colleagues and friends. We have had some great times together working hard, debating, arguing, laughing, playing and I just want to thank you.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60118\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-25/event-honors-michael-d-young/","id":2920,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2919,2918,2917],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Main Office, located inside the MultiCultural Center. The proposed entrance would allow entrance to the A.S. Office from the exterior of the building, unlike than the interior entrance that currently exists. <em>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Associated Students President Ali Guthy presented a proposal to create a new entrance to the A.S. Main Office in the MultiCultural Center (MCC) during <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/\">last week’s A.S. Senate meeting</a> in response to what she claims is student-need as described in the Vision 2020 A.S. Student Strategic Plan.</p>\n<p>The proposal, according to Guthy, is a response to the A.S. Student Strategic Plan released in Spring 2014, which laid out A.S.’s goals for the next five years. Under the proposal, the second floor of the outdoor MCC patio area will be changed to a conference room that will be predominantly used by A.S. officials.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year sociology and psychology major Guthy, there are plenty of reasons to have a new entrance, since she claims that the current space is “bunker-like” and “inaccessible” to students.</p>\n<p>“Although the association has done its best to advertise its location, the bunker-like structure inhibits open access to the space and its resources,” Guthy said. “Associated Students is funded entirely by students and serves to facilitate student needs. I find it troubling that this space isn’t readily open and accessible to all students, given that students are the ones paying for it.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many generations of students have been asking for greater accessibility to these spaces and such a change will benefit future students. – AS President Ali Guthy</p></blockquote>\n<p>MCC office manager Enma Elias however said that the idea of a new entrance is “nice,” but that MCC employees would like things to stay the same.</p>\n<p>“It definitely would be nice to see this proposal, but from what I know, we want to keep things the same,” Elias said. “Especially because the outdoor patio area outside of the MCC entrance is always used for conferences each summer and spring by people outside of UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Although the proposal has not been approved by Senate, Guthy said it will benefit future students, particularly student leaders, for informational purposes.</p>\n<p>“Future student leaders, over the next few years, could continue to contribute information to this space and feature information that they find necessary,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>MCC co-chair and third year film &amp; media studies major Ashley Baker said she opposes Guthy’s plan because Guthy did not ask for input from the MCC co-chairs.</p>\n<p>“I do not like the idea of this proposal at all. Ali did not have the courtesy to discuss this with [co-chair Anumita Kaur] and I, and I find that extremely unfair,” Baker said in an email.</p>\n<p>“As MCC co-chairs we should have been involved in the process of developing this idea as this construction will absolutely obstruct MCC affairs.”</p>\n<p>According to Baker, Guthy’s proposal, if acted upon, could obstruct other non-student government bodies from properly organizing.</p>\n<p>“The MCC is the only place that marginalized groups (people of color and/or LGBTQ) have to organize, study and have social/political gatherings,” Baker said in an email.</p>\n<p>However, Guthy said students have always had a specific demand for greater accessibility to the A.S. Main Office.</p>\n<p>“Many generations of students have been asking for greater accessibility to these spaces and such a change will benefit future students,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>According to Elias, the current lack of space on campus will only be exacerbated should plans for the new entrance come to fruition.</p>\n<p>“Corwin Pavilion has a patio right outside of our main entrance. Corwin needs their space as well and I don’t think they’d like that idea,” Elias said. “UCen lacks space too and all these building are near so it’s all relative: There’s a lack of space … It’s actually really cramped in here.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Productive for the privileged, but what about folks who are disadvantaged? – MCC co-chair Ashley Baker</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth-year film &amp; media studies major and MCC media designer A.J. Price said she also does not agree with Guthy’s proposal and plans to “vote against it for sure” if it is proposed to the student body.</p>\n<p>Second-year French and economics-accounting major and Democratic Process (DP) party senator Steven Kwok however said the new entrance would be beneficial because it would provide students with direct access to the A.S. Main Office and would thus allow students to be “more connected to their government.”</p>\n<p>“I think the new entrance to the MCC is a great idea,” Kwok said in an email. “The student body will be able to directly access AS through the entrance instead of having to enter through the hall that extends to the main corridor of the MCC. This gives AS a face to the outside beyond the lettering that is currently on the building.”</p>\n<p>Former Open People’s Party (OPP) senator and fourth-year political science major Marvin Ramirez said the university lacks student space and that students can benefit “greatly” from the new space should it be constructed.</p>\n<p>“Seeing as people out in I.V. are now charging students for their access to study spaces, spacing has been a large issue,” Ramirez said. “The university accepts more students which is awesome, but remains the same structurally inside. This cannot always be the case so a new conference room space may be of great value. Creating a new conference room that may potentially be a long-term investment is not a bad thing.”</p>\n<p>However, Baker said the proposal and conference room renovation is an example of what she alleges is elitist decision-making favoring “white and hetero-normative” OPP affiliates who she claims will not solve space issues that benefit people of color.</p>\n<p>“Productive for the privileged, but what about folks who are disadvantaged?” Baker said in an email. “Where are the fruits of their labor? We must note that the university was physically built and is still preserved by the muscle by countless economically deprived people of color. Look at how they have cornered El Centro with the library renovation.”</p>\n<p>According to Baker, enacting Guthy’s proposed renovation will continue to unevenly distribute space to a student group that has “more than enough.”</p>\n<p>“I do not believe this change to be necessary as they have more than enough space. Half of the university belongs to them. How inconsiderate can one be is my question?” Baker said in an email. “If this proposal is passed future generations will once again have to fight for an area that was already theirs.”</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-60704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A recent proposal from the Financial Aid Office considers lowering the amount of financial aid that students who have waived Gaucho Health Insurance receive.</p></div>\n<p>The Financial Aid Office has recently proposed a plan to reduce financial aid benefits to students who waive the Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) for the 2015-2016 academic year.</p>\n<p>Under the proposed plan, students receiving financial aid who waive GHI will receive less money than those who keep university student health insurance and will instead receive aid based on a student survey-based “industry average” determined by the university. UCSB has the most expensive health insurance plan in the UC system at around $2,568 per year ($856 per quarter) for the next academic year, and up to 50 percent of students waive this plan every school year.</p>\n<p>GHI Advisory Committee Budget Officer Mike Anderson said the plan exists to better allocate financial aid resources to students in need.</p>\n<p>“If a student already has insurance then the financial aid office will take that money and give it to others who are financially struggling,” Anderson said. “They need the GHI Plan and can increase their financial aid package. I tend to believe it would be a benefit especially to those who are staying in the GHI Plan and refocus those funds to those students.”</p>\n<p>However, according to A.S. President and fourth-year sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy, the Financial Aid Board wrongly assumes students receiving financial aid do not need the money given for health insurance.</p>\n<p>“If you remove the funding for health insurance because you waived the Gaucho Health Insurance does not mean you have the money for health insurance. You may still need that money to pay for the other health insurance,” Guthy said. “Students who waive out of health insurance are not incurring that cost for health insurance or have a family plan.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Providing less benefits will provide more incentive for people to get GHI which equals more money for them. But this isn’t really anything new — fucking over the college kids to make more money. Can’t really say that I’m surprised. —Andrew Okeh</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. is currently working with the Financial Aid Office to reach an agreement to avoid cutting the financial aid benefits for student health insurance.</p>\n<p>First-year computer science major Andrew Okeh said he believes the plan does not benefit students and instead profits the university.</p>\n<p>“Since when are less benefits ever good?” Okeh said. “The people who are involved with the board, it’s good for them because providing less benefits will provide more incentive for people to get GHI which equals more money for them. But this isn’t really anything new — fucking over the college kids to make more money. Can’t really say that I’m surprised.”</p>\n<p>First-year environmental studies major Navpreet Khabra said she also opposes the proposal because she believes that the aid students receive specifically allocated to health insurance is valuable to students who opt out of GHI.</p>\n<p>“By lowering their financial aid award, it could offset the money that they would have saved,” Khabra said. “I personally was able to use the money saved from waiving GHI for other educational expenses such as textbooks and transportation.”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, however, if students waive GHI it implies they have more affordable health insurance plans.</p>\n<p>“If people waive out then they have other health insurance, it’s already in the family budget and calculated for,” Anderson said. “Because they have health insurance, they’ll waive out. There’s a large percentage of students who don’t have health insurance like students overseas. It’s something we’re exploring. It may or may not happen.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60837\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60837\" data-attachment-id=\"60837\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/ghi/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?fit=1384%2C466&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1384,466\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"GHI\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?fit=250%2C84&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?fit=888%2C299&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60837\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI-1024x345.jpg?resize=600%2C202\" alt=\"Austin Bernales/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?resize=1024%2C345&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?resize=250%2C84&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GHI.jpg?w=1384&amp;ssl=1 1384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60837\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Austin Bernales/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Guthy, she and the Internal Vice President Angela Lau have reached a compromise with the Financial Aid Board that would allow students to possibly alter their financial aid award under certain financial circumstances.</p>\n<p>“Let’s say the industry average is $1,500 and if you pay more than that, you could go to the financial aid office to adjust that,” Guthy said. “We reached a verbal agreement on our meeting on Friday so I’m pretty sure that’s what we’re doing.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the plan will be ultimately beneficial because it will help students who are financially struggling by expanding the available limits on general financial aid funding.</p>\n<p>“Financial aid offices run out of money. They give out grants and scholarships and then are left with loans. They could give those grants to those who are having a tougher time and I think that would be a good thing,” Anderson said. “I tend to believe it would be a benefit especially to those who are staying in the GHI Plan and refocus those funds to those students.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics and accounting major Paige Donaldson however said the plan is “terrible” because it does not help students save money.</p>\n<p>“I waived the health insurance because I couldn’t afford it, so how would cutting my financial aid do any good?” Donaldson said. “Either way it’s a trap to make us pay more and make money off of us, but students are not to be treated like walking money bags to make a profit.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having to pay for GHI in order to receive the funds I need just to be able to attend this school is a sure fire way to alienate a large portion of the student body. Low key, fuck GHI.<strong> —</strong>Willie Roman</p></blockquote>\n<p>Willie Roman, a first-year English and economics double major said he’s surprised the plan is even being considered.</p>\n<p>“Personally, as a student from a low income household, my financial aid is absolutely critical, and stretched thin as it is,” Roman said. “Having to pay for GHI in order to receive the funds I need just to be able to attend this school is a sure fire way to alienate a large portion of the student body. Low key, fuck GHI.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy however, the Financial Aid Board has been open to working with the student body to enact reasonable financial aid policy and are hoping students participate in the upcoming surveys.</p>\n<p>“Financial Aid Office is sending out a survey to gauge the industry average and collect more data. They won’t erase the funding entirely but will lessen it to the industry average,” Guthy said. “We encourage people to do the survey to give students time to prepare for this change. I think we’ve reached a good conclusion.”</p>\n<p>Anderson, said a decision regarding the proposal, whose rising costs are due to the Affordable Health Care Act, will be made in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to wrap it up here in the next few weeks,” Anderson said. “There used to be caps on the benefits of each person. It’s getting expensive because the Affordable Health Care act put no caps on the benefits.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, February 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60836\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60836\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/","id":2922,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2921,2920,2919],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
