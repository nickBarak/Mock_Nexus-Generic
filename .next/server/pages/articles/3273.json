But I have friends struggling for rent, struggling for tuition. I can’t imagine an added fee,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was the desire to strike a good balance between paying artists for their art and making grad photos as accessible as possible that led her to create the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison was initially going to stake out by Henley Gate alone, but then she decided to post on Facebook about her idea to get more photographers for the event. Once she had heard back from a handful of people, she set up a group chat for everyone to schedule themselves for shifts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Niko Van Eimeren, one of the photographers at the event, said she signed up to help because she personally understood the struggle graduating students face when paying for end-of-the-year expenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a fourth-year environmental studies major, Van Eimeren said she herself wasn’t sure if she was going to get her graduation photos taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[For] a lot of my friends, I took their photos for them at a discounted rate ‘cause I know that it can be really expensive,” Van Eimeren said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alejandra Gularte, one of the students who attended the event to have her photos taken, said she appreciated the event’s impact on both graduating students and photographers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I found it was a way to help smaller photographers that maybe wanted to get practice. But also, for me, it’s cheaper, because I pay a lot of money for school,” Gularte said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison gives all the credit for the event to the photographers who signed up to help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This was only possible because people were volunteering their time to do their photos,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Photography isn’t always something you’d think would be something you could do to help people,” Morrison said.  “Anyone can really do something like this, stuff like this means a lot to people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also noted that as a graduating student, it can be difficult to see all of your friends posting their photos and not be able to afford them yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a good grad photo to give to their mom — it’s like a small thing in your day, but honestly would make someone’s day,” she said. “If you can, take time out of your personal life to do a nice thing once in a while.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year art major Reannah Viray took inspiration from that idea and put her own twist on it.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88921\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88921\" data-attachment-id=\"88921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/pay-what-you-can-photography-event-inspires-other-students-to-give-back/pay-what-you-can_sanya-kamidi_online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1246&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1246\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pay What You Can_Sanya Kamidi_ONLINE (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88921 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=888%2C553\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pay-What-You-Can_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Viray usually paints graduation caps for other students for a base fee of $30 with an added $5 for each extra detail, so she said she understood why students often opted to not get them done. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viray hosted her own pay-what-you-can event for graduating seniors on Wednesday in the Arbor, offering her art services to anyone who wanted their cap decorated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a photographer in high school, so I wish that I could have participated, but I didn’t know how to until it was over, so I was like, ‘what other way can I spare my time to people who don’t have the resources or the income necessarily to get grad caps done?’” Viray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Viray usually paints graduation caps for other students for a base fee of $30 with an added $5 for each extra detail, so she said she understood why students often opted to not get them done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s nice to be able to offer something that could be seen as a luxury to people that can’t afford it.

When I first came to UCSB, I didn’t really like it here, and being in the residential community was something that really changed that for me,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Voss said she recognized the importance of RHA’s primary focus on event planning and management, she felt that the association could further expand its supply of resources for residents by providing more professional and academic opportunities in the dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to have safe, alternative events that people can go to. But I also think that’s not what makes living in the dorms better. I think what makes living in the dorms better is having different kinds of facilities, opportunities and resources that you don’t get off campus,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these insights in mind, Voss ran for RHA president against incumbent </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kyle Bates</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in spring  2018 and won.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came into the position this year not necessarily knowing what I was getting myself into. I knew that I loved RHA’s mission, and I loved the fact that we get to do work that’s so personal and intimate,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Voss’s biggest goals this past year was working on the expansion of professional and academic resources for residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss is currently implementing a series of workshops focused on event planning and management. The workshops would teach students the basics of event planning, from making room reservations to funding requests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her presidency, Voss prioritized building connections with offices such as Residential and Community Living (RNCL) and Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE). She said that she noticed a disconnect between these entities and residents and took it upon herself to become an intermediary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not that these offices don’t care about these issues, it’s that they don’t know about them. Their offices are separate from students, and they don’t really employ students in their offices,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss explained that higher entities are often uninformed about everyday residential issues such as laundry malfunctions. She feels that by maintaining stronger channels of communication between these offices and RHA, these problems can be solved more efficiently and effectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m someone who’s not really afraid to stand up and advocate for students, and I’m not someone who’s going to say I’m going to do something and then not do it. For me that has to do with going into a conversation with these offices with a really clear plan of exactly what I’d like to do,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss is also committed to seeking creative, alternative sources for funding when entities like RNCL are not equipped to fund certain programs. This includes applying for grants from the Zero Waste Committee and seeking funds from other organizations on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we do have great sources of funding as RHA, I’m definitely willing to look to other resources if we can’t fulfill the kinds of things that I think are important to students through those resources,” Voss said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As RHA president, Voss attended </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PACURH (Pacific Affiliate of College and University Residence Halls) housing conferences at UCLA and Southern Oregon University in November</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Fifty schools from the Pacific Region, which includes California, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington and Oregon, were invited to the conference.. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss said the money for conferences came entirely from fundraising and not student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss also created “Resources with RHA,” a program that distributes hundreds of free midterm materials in the residence halls every quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She  is also working with several members of RHA to create a new position in Hall Councils next year: an International Student Engagement Chair. The position will work closely with the Office of International Student Services (OISS) to ensure adequate resources and opportunities for international students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After completing her first year as RHA president, Voss decided to run again in an effort to accomplish her longer-term goals and projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constant changes in leadership affect the productivity of student government each year, Voss said. This problem is especially pertinent for RHA, she added, since living in the residence halls is a requirement of being in the organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every single year RHA is completely different than the previous year, and very few of the projects are long-lasting,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voss took 63% of the vote in this year’s RHA elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I can take a lot of things I’ve done this year and make it even better for next year in a way that leaves a stronger foundation for the next RHA,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited for the fact that in RHA we really have the agency to accomplish a lot of wonderful things, and that I feel like I have such a stronger idea of how RHA works and how to actually get projects off the ground,” Voss said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Editor’s Note]: Laila Voss is a copy editor for the</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Daily Nexus</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
