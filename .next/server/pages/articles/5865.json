The guests included Rosa Tran, Shannon McIntosh, Liz Garbus, Alison Eastwood, Svetlana Cvetko and Susan Cartsonis. They talked about their careers and the films they were being awarded for with moderator Madelyn Hammond. She created the panel and has been moderating it for thirteen years.</p>\n<p>Tran produced “Anomalisa,” a stop-motion film directed by Charlie Kaufman and received an Oscar nomination for her work. She described her progression through the industry: she went to film school, paying her way through as a manicurist. After working in reality TV, she became a writer’s assistant on Comedy Central and became a puppet coordinator for Robot Chicken. “Anomalisa” co-director Duke Johnson showed her the film’s script, convincing her to produce.       When asked about what was difficult about the production, Tran replied, -“[Keeping everyone together] was tough. There was someone crying her eyes out in the parking lot. You tell her she’s amazing and that this hasn’t been done before, and we’ll figure it out together.”</p>\n<p>Shannon McIntosh produced “The Hateful Eight,” working alongside Quentin Tarantino, whose enthusiasm she described as “infectious.” She is a former employee of pre-Disney Miramax. “I had a work ethic that was unparalleled for anyone who worked there.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>McIntosh described how one of the greatest difficulties that came out of “Eight” was the fact that there were only around a dozen working 70mm cameras in the United States. As that was the format Tarantino wanted the film to be shown in, McIntosh had to scrounge together parts from other cameras in order to make sure there would be enough projectors to screen the film in.</p>\n<p>Garbus is a renowned documentarian. Her Oscar-nominated film, “What Happened, Miss Simone?” chronicles the life and career of jazz singer and activist Nina Simone. It was made over a period of 13 months and released on Netflix.</p>\n<p>When she was in high school, she made her own documentary and showed it at a party, where a PBS producer was in attendance. Afterwards, she studied film at college. A meeting with a prison journalist led her to Angola State Prison, where Garbus met and talked to ten inmates. The resulting documentary “The Farm: Angola, USA,” earned her her first Oscar nomination.</p>\n<p>Eastwood is the daughter of film legend and fellow director Clint Eastwood. -“My brother and I grew up on set,” she said. Her picture “Battlecreek” involves a romance between a girl and a boy with a skin disease.</p>\n<p>While watching the production of her father’s films, Eastwood felt a need to get involved in film. “I wanted to pay attention. I didn’t want to just sit around.” Ever since, she’s done, “… a lot of good movies, a lot of crappy movies. I learned what not to do. I wanted to produce and develop.”</p>\n<p>“Battlecreek’s” script had to be refined over the course of several months and re-started altogether when the original production fell apart. “The passion [keeps me going],” Eastwood said. The production was ultimately saved when someone wrote a check for the whole film.</p>\n<p>Yugoslavian native Cvetko works on films as a cinematographer. She started out as a camera assistant on a film set. Later, she went to India to make a short film, which was shown at Sundance.</p>\n<p>Like Gaarbus, Cvetko works on documentaries. “In [that] world, the team is very very small. Personal, tight.” Most crews are male, “but there are some amazing women kicking ass out there.” Cvetko says sometimes, she has to convince her male crewmembers that she is on their side.</p>\n<p>Cartsonis is the president of production company Storefront Pictures. She attended both UCLA and NYU, deciding she wanted to be a scriptwriter. She ended up getting a job reading scripts at 20th Century Fox, reading up to four a day.</p>\n<p>She went on to attract the attention of Scott Rudin, a film producer. After asking her to be his assistant, Cartsonis called him back and, at the urging of her boss, said, “I want to be an executive.”</p>\n<p>“Okay,” Rudin replied. Cartsonis gained the title of “Untitled Creative Executive,” later becoming a Senior Vice President of Production.</p>\n<p>Despite her high position in the film world, she described how it can sometimes be difficult to acquire funds to make films, something the other panelists agreed with. “You have to figure out the ways that are natural to you to ask for money.” She recently made “Carrie Pilby,” a Kickstarter-backed film.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the event, Hammond asked the filmmakers if they had any pearls of wisdom to share.</p>\n<p>Eastwood’s stood out the most: “If there’s something you want to do, do it. Visualize it. Do whatever you have to do to make it happen.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-women/","id":5865,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5864,5863,5862],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung","biography":"Not available","articles":[5768,5773,5785,5800,5801,5807,5811,5821,5830,5833,5837,5843,5844,5845,5847,5851,5864,5865,5866,5868,5871,5872,5874,5892,5895,5896,5900,5903,5904,5907,5911,5912,5914,5915,5916,5917,5918,5921,5927,5939,5940,5941,5943,5946,5951,5976,5977,5978,5999,6000,6001,6004,6016,6023,6032,6034,6062,6067,6141,6150,6154,6164,6916],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Bringin’ Back the Thunder","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/opinion-reefer-art.jpg?resize=255%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/opinion-reefer-art.jpg?resize=255%2C237&ssl=1","description":"In this letter to the editor, Reza Garajedaghi tells of the origins of true Gaucho spirit and encourages students to join the alumni in bringing the \"thunder back to the dome.\"","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For thousands of UCSB alums going back as far as the late 80’s, some of their most cherished memories took place at the Thunderdome, cheering on their men’s hoops players. So this past year, a group of us old UCSB alums who helped create the current Gaucho Locos cheering section got together and decided to create an unofficial, grassroots alumni weekend, affectionately nameed Domecoming.</p>\n<p>The original Gaucholocos were called Gauchoholics. The university did not like the reference to boozing it up, but that won’t stop more than a few alums from sporting the original Gauchoholics T-shirts at this weekend’s big match up versus Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>For most of you, Harder Stadium is where you have spent most of your time cheering for UCSB. I am here to tell you that back in the day, it was the T-dome that was one of the most feared and craziest college arenas in the country — if you don’t trust me, just YouTube some of the old Thunderdome games vs. UNLV back in the 90’s.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This weekend, hundreds of alums are coming back to UCSB to do the I.V.

The current ’Locos meet at Gio’s before the game, so come out to Sam’s first, get a beer with the alums, pass over your resume, do some networking, then head over to Gio’s as we do the Loop. Then we’ll all march over to the Dome to rock Cal Poly off the court!</p>\n<p>This year’s men’s team is a very special team and has already beaten the likes of UNLV on the road and Cal here at home.

Academy Award-nominated actress Rooney Mara arrived punctually at the 2016 Santa Barbara International Film Festival to receive her very own tribute award. As the 2016 recipient of the Cinema Vanguard Award, the 30-year-old succeeds past winners like Leonardo DiCaprio and Eddie Redmayne.</p>\n<p>For her contributions to the cinema in the past year, Mara is recognized for her work in the film, “Carol.” Based on the British romance novel, <em>The Price of Salt</em>, the film follows the love story between the divorced suburban housewife (played by Cate Blanchett) and an ordinary shop girl (Mara). The period drama revolves around the complex romance between two women from different backgrounds. Both Blanchett and Mara are nominated respectfully in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories. Having won the Best Actress Award at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival in May of last year, Mara was a shoo-in to receive an Oscar nomination months before the nominations were announced in January.</p>\n<p>Dressed in a menswear-inspired ivory lace top and skirt, the young actress was accompanied by the film director before he presented her with the award on stage. In an exclusive <em>Daily Nexus</em> interview with Mara and the film director, Todd Haynes, the “Carol” duo shared a few anecdotes and memories:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bin Nguyen</strong>: What was it like filming the love scenes with Cate Blanchett?</p>\n<p><strong>Rooney Mara</strong>: Working with Cate was incredible. We have a very similar work ethic. It was really easy from the rehearsal period … It definitely clicked. She is very generous and I felt super comfortable with her and with Todd.</p>\n<p>BN: How did the period costumes help you transform into character?</p>\n<p>RM: Costumes in any film are always a huge thing with the character … It can change everything about the way you move, depending on whether you’re wearing [it] in a scene or what point of the film your character is in. Costumes, to me, are very important. Sandy Powell is an incredible costume designer, I just [wore] whatever she told me to wear.</p>\n<p>BN: What did you take away from filming “Carol” for your own life?</p>\n<p><strong>[Todd Haynes</strong> interjects]: You’re a lesbian now!</p>\n<p><strong>RM</strong>: [jokingly] Yes, yes I am … haha.</p>\n<p><strong>BN: </strong>Will there be more of Lisbeth Salander [Mara’s role in the “Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”] in the coming future?</p>\n<p><strong>RM: </strong>I believe there will be. Hopefully with me, but I really don’t know.</p>\n<p>After the “Girl with the Dragon with the Tattoo” actress finished all the interviews, she walked inside the theater to begin the night’s events. Mara and the interviewer of the night, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> correspondent Joe McGovern, both sat alongside each other and watched clips from her previous films, starting with her minimal but pivotal role in “The Social Network” all the way up to “Carol.” While appearing mildly uncomfortable watching herself on screen, the actress spoke of her fond memories working with directors David Fincher and Steven Soderbergh. A pre-taped tribute video by Blanchett played for the award recipient and the audience. The “Queen Elizabeth” actress praised her young co-star for her performance in film. At the final moments of the evening, Haynes stepped on stage to bestow his star with the Cinema Vanguard Award.</p>\n<p>Rooney Mara is a sensational actress who captures every screen that she is in. Her graceful demure and relaxed attitude is evident on and off screen. With only a few films and nominations under her belt, the young actress has the longevity of the likes such as Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren. If she doesn’t win an Oscar for her performance in “Carol” this year, Rooney Mara will for sure win an Oscar in the definite future.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/sbiff-cinema-vanguard-award-rooney-mara-interview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/sbiff-cinema-vanguard-award-rooney-mara-interview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/sbiff-cinema-vanguard-award-rooney-mara-interview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/sbiff-cinema-vanguard-award-rooney-mara-interview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/sbiff-cinema-vanguard-award-rooney-mara-interview/","id":5863,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[5862,5861,5860],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBIFF Director’s Panel","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Santa Barbara International Film Festival held the Outstanding Directors of the Year Award at the Arlington Theater on Feb. 11.

We’d been in the room for about a month. And we thought, “Great, it’ll be wonderful. We’ll have some space to work in and everything.” But actually it was challenging because I think we got really used to that environment in the studio, you know? And our lives were pretty regular, you know? When you’re shooting in the studio, you can arrive at a certain time and you can work the same hours every day. And then we [went] back out into the crazy world of the outside world. And I think we also sort of missed Room a little bit. And it was also cold. It was Canadian winter. So yeah, it was tricky.</p>\n<p>AW: Considering that Jack’s point of view melds with Ma’s unlike the book, did you find it difficult to imbue the movie with a sense of wonder and imagination?</p>\n<p>LA: I think that point of view was the biggest challenge in the whole movie. Inside Room, we sort of moved between being with him and being with her, and when we’re with him, I think the audience starts to feel more of that childlike tone, and when you’re with her, you feel the darker aspect of the place. So it’s challenging because you’re looking at what it’s really like, and that’s really intense. So to keep the magic can be hard, but I think we managed to do it.</p>\n<p>AW: How’s “Neverhome” going?</p>\n<p>LA: We’re still working on the script, so that’s a little bit down the line. There are a couple other projects that’ll probably happen beforehand. But it’s great. It’s a great film. Great story.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68298\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68298\" data-attachment-id=\"68298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/sbiff-directors-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-1.jpg?fit=1335%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1335,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF Directors-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-1.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-68298\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-1-684x1024.jpg?resize=250%2C375\" alt=\"Lenny Abrahamson, director of Room.

The director wrote a five page letter to the author of the novel, Emma Donoghue, upon which the film was based in an attempt to convince her that he was the right director.</p>\n<p>She did not agree right away, but became more convinced that he was the right choice after she saw his films. Donoghue would go on to pen the film’s script and be nominated for an Oscar herself.</p>\n<p>Abrahamson explained that he cast Brie Larson in the leading role because he felt she could easily bond with a child. Jacob Tremblay was cast only four months before principal photography began. Since he was still a young child, the crew didn’t want him to noticeably age as shooting went on.</p>\n<p>The director discussed how the titular room was built in Pinewood, the same studio in which “The Force Awakens” was shot. The set was small and cramped, making it difficult to shoot, but it was also intimate. “I was in the bath sometimes and popped up to give instructions at the end of scenes,” Abrahamson said.</p>\n<p>After him came Alejandro G. Iñárritu, director of “The Revenant” and last year’s Oscar winner for Best Director for “Birdman.” Cheers from the crowd standing outside the barriers heralded his arrival. On the red carpet, reporters swarmed the informally dressed Iñárritu as he walked into the Arlington.</p>\n<p>He explained what drew him to the story: “I saw some elements I really was attracted to, and one of them was the fact that there was a linear story in a very clear, simple way in what these men went through in this huge landscape and solitude. The simplicity of it in a way gave some opportunities [to] other things. I was curious about it. Because it was something I’ve never done before, it was terrifying.”</p>\n<p>Like in “Birdman” (which he described as a portrait of a suicide), Iñárritu worked with Emmanuel Luzbecki, who was also the cinematographer for “Gravity.” Iñárritu described him as “a chronic dissatisfied person” and was only as good as he was because “he has sausages and chicken for breakfast, or Mexican Coca-Cola,” which drew laughs from the audience.</p>\n<p>Tom McCarthy was up next. Feinberg asked him if his Catholic background made it difficult for him to take on “Spotlight.”</p>\n<p>“No, it wasn’t. The information was so compelling,” McCarthy said.</p>\n<p>Besides being a director and writer, McCarthy also has some acting experience. He portrayed the ethically challenged reporter Scott Templeton on “The Wire,” and said the experience made him interested in journalism.</p>\n<p>In order to accurately recount the story of “Spotlight,” McCarthy and his co-writer Josh Singer met with multiple individuals involved with the case, both journalists and victims. One of them, abuse survivor Phil Saviano, was in the audience and received applause when McCarthy asked him to stand. Saviano filmed the rest of McCarthy’s talk with Feinberg on his phone.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68300\" style=\"width: 378px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68300\" data-attachment-id=\"68300\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/sbiff-directors-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF Directors-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-3.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68300\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-3-1024x684.jpg?resize=368%2C246\" alt=\"Tom McCarthy, director of Spotlight.

McKay is primarily a writer of comedies and noted he was aware of how surprising it was that he went from writing “Step Brothers” to making a movie about one of the biggest stories of the past half-century.</p>\n<p>The film came about when McKay’s agent, Phil Roberts, asked him if he could direct anything, what would it be? McCarthy replied that he wanted to adapt <em>The Big Short</em>.</p>\n<p>“Let me make a call,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>Before he knew it, Brad Pitt’s production company, Plan B Entertainment, was asking him to direct (and Brad Pitt was asking to be in it). However, Adam Goodman, the head of Paramount, laughed in McKay’s face when he listed all the actors he wanted to cast.</p>\n<p>Despite this, McKay was able to bring in nearly everyone he wanted. For the scenes where the characters break the fourth wall, he cast Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez and Richard Thaler. He described Gomez as sharp and Thaler, an economist, as a “diva.”</p>\n<p>As for how the film was received publicly, McKay expressed joy at seeing people on Twitter saying that they didn’t know how to feel about his film. To him, that was a sign that he had made a thoughtful work. “The Big Short” was screened for Congress and was admired by progressives and conservatives alike.</p>\n<p>Finally came George Miller, director of “Fury Road” as well as the preceding three “Mad Max” movies. He had time for a single question.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68299\" style=\"width: 378px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68299\" data-attachment-id=\"68299\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/sbiff-directors-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF Directors-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68299\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=368%2C246\" alt=\"George Miller, director of Mad Max: Fury Road.

Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>AW: What were the challenges of melding practical and special effects on such a giant scale?</p>\n<p>GM: Well, it’s very logistical. You need a huge team to do it. You need a lot of planning. So we were like an army. You’ve got to think of it like an army, except you’re not going to war, but you have to make sure everyone’s safe. You have to make sure everyone’s prepared, and in the execution, you’ve got to make sure you get it all in your camera. So it’s a big logistical exercise.</p>\n<p>Inside the Arlington, Miller didn’t discuss the film itself as much as he did his family and the nature of his franchise’s stories. “My mother recently asked me, ‘I thought after the ‘Happy Feet’ movies you were settling down. Now I’m not so sure.’”</p>\n<p>Miller also directed “Babe: Pig in the City.”</p>\n<p>“When you have kids, all you do is watch family movies,” Miller said. “Everyone loves those stories. And now that [my kids] are grown up, I can make more Mad Maxes.”</p>\n<p>The original “Mad Max” was shot in Australia on a small budget and released in 1979. It introduced the character of Max Rockatansky, played by Mel Gibson. The character has remained a staple of pop-culture since. “I wasn’t aware of it at the time, but somehow we tapped into a pre-classic archetype,” Miller said. He compared the “Mad Max” movies to American westerns.</p>\n<p>“What’s so seductive about ‘Mad Max’ stories is that they’re allegorical,” he said. “We can’t exist without stories. It’s how we make the world coherent.”</p>\n<p>Towards the end of his talk, Miller mentioned what has been one of the most surprising reactions towards “Fury Road” for him: “Someone came up to me and told me ‘I’ve just had a baby girl, and I called her Furiosa.’ And I thought, ‘Holy cow.’”</p>\n<p>To cap off the event, all five directors were brought out at once to talk to each other and continue answering questions from Feinberg.</p>\n<p>When asked how they met each other, McKay revealed, much to the assembled audience’s amusement, that Tom McCarthy was once his employee at RadioShack. During an altercation, McKay told his employee, “Goddammit Tom, this is RadioShack!”</p>\n<p>“Are you for real?” McCarthy replied. He promptly quit.</p>\n<p>As he left, McKay turned to his co-workers and said, “That’s a loser.” He continued to rib the good-natured McCarthy, joking that he didn’t care for “Spotlight.”</p>\n<p>Abrahamson saw the film at Telluride. “There’s a level of understatement and naturalism. I sat back and thought, that’s the best thing of ‘70s American moviemaking.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68301\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68301\" data-attachment-id=\"68301\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-23/sbiff-directors-panel/sbiff-directors-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF Directors-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68301\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SBIFF-Directors-4-1024x684.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Alejandro González Iñárritu, director of The Revenant.

All that atmosphere suddenly turns. The minimalism covers so many things that are so profound. George, when I saw ‘Mad Max’ I was exhausted.
