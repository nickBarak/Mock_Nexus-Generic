Many of us have all the qualifications needed for a job, but are not hired because we fail to effectively market ourselves to employers. Is that our fault? Not really. Honestly, there aren’t that many places on campus to practice this invaluable skill. Having a stellar resume and a hard-earned bachelor’s degree proudly written at the top is only the first step to landing a job. But even if you have that, do you know where to send it? Do you have connections in HR departments at companies? I know I don’t. And I am frustrated that this school doesn’t do much to help foster those connections. How can I get across what I alone have to offer that no other college graduate has?</p>\n<p>I know I am not alone. Most students struggle with deciding how to best market themselves and prove their uniqueness because it isn’t easy. It requires an analysis of who you are and what you want. The most important thing to remember is to be true to yourself. Even if you are not currently seeking employment, it is still critical to have an “elevator pitch” prepared just in case you run into someone who works for your dream employer. An elevator pitch is a one-minute spiel that sums up who you are and what you have to offer. This is your personal brand that you should know by heart and be able to share confidently with others.</p>\n<p>Once you have your brand down, it’s important to build your network of connections. Many people will tell you that they heard about a job opening or even got hired because they had connections to the right people. As a UCSB student there do exist some connections to faculty and co-workers that we have honed over our years here. An expanded network means you have a greater chance that one of your connections leads to a job, internship or even just valuable career advice that changes your life. Plain and simple.</p>\n<p>The good news is it seems that my concerns have been heard. The Career Peers at Career Services are hosting a special event to help people like me learn how to market themselves and make connections. They’ve called their event “Brand Yourself for Success: A Night of Networking.” While this is their first attempt at doing something like this, it is nice to know that certain departments on campus really are concerned with making sure we go into the real world with a skill to help us land jobs. On Thursday, April 26, from 5 to 7 p.m. at Mosher Alumni House, they are bringing in a keynote speaker to lecture on how to brand yourself for the job market. Following the lecture, they are bringing in over 20 employers from different industries as well as some faculty to listen and critique how we come across and our first impressions. From what they say, the event is aimed at providing valuable feedback on how well we are selling ourselves. The best part is that it is an opportunity to practice networking with professionals in a setting where they are completely focused on meeting you and helping you.</p>\n<p>This event is a valuable opportunity for UCSB students to improve their professional image. Because lecture space is limited, those who want to attend must RSVP on GauchoLink by Thursday, April 19, to reserve a spot. So take advantage of this chance to develop your personal brand and mingle with professionals; I know I will.</p>\n<p>Sarah Puckette is a fourth-year zoology major and A.J.

What do you envision yourself doing? Are you dressing up in that “sultry spirit” costume (who knew being a ghost could be so revealing?) and lurking amongst your drunken peers in Isla Vista? Or are you opting for the not-so-wild alternative of curling up in your lofted bed to watch a horror movie? If your answer was more like the latter, then a Netflix horror movie is probably in your future.</p>\n<p>But let’s remember that this is Netflix we’re dealing with here: a streaming website that is 20% decent content and 80% god awful, low-budget flicks.

The movie begins with Lance Preston, the star of the fictional Ghost Hunters copycat TV show “Grave Encounters,” and his crew locking themselves in a haunted psychiatric hospital for the night. Little do they know that when they locked themselves in, they sealed their grisly fate. “Grave Encounters” is certainly one of those horror movies whose characters deserve what they have coming for them (isn’t it common sense to not stand next to a bathtub full of blood?), but I have to admit that this film is just as good as it is bad. Guilty pleasure status? I’d say yes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/HEmuFgHZZK0frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/HEmuFgHZZK0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p><strong>“Paranormal Activity 4”</strong></p>\n<p>The “Paranormal Activity” series could have maintained its dignity if it was not for this fourth installment. Riding on the coattails of the previous three movies, “Paranormal Activity 4” was both largely anticipated and largely disappointing. Its contents are cheap jump scares, a lazily put together plot and a girl that looks kind of like Dakota Fanning. That last detail is probably the most memorable part of the movie.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Children of the Corn”</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to like this one for Stephen King. I really did. But it is kind of hard to take a movie seriously when the killers are small children that speak like they are from the 19th century and the lead villain is a ginger with an awful middle part. Indeed, “Children of the Corn” revolves around a small town taken over by children that kill anyone over the age of 18. A couple (both over the age of 18) find themselves trapped here while on a road trip, and as predicted, find themselves fighting for their lives. A word of warning: if you decide to watch this, you may never look at corn the same way ever again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“Children of the Corn 3: Urban Harvest”</strong></p>\n<p>I guess I just couldn’t get enough of the first “Children of the Corn.” This film opens to a scene of a crazy Amish father chasing after his sons in a corn field. Little does he know that one of his sons is a prophet of a demon that resides in the corn, because that son quickly summons the demon and the corn kills the father. Yes, apparently vegetables can be deadly. The rest of the film follows the corn-demon-prophet-boy as he begins to terrorize his new foster family. Complete with (bad) early nineties special effects, “Children of the Corn 3” is somehow even cheesier than the original. Overall, this installment was bad.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>“The Human Centipede”</strong></p>\n<p>This is one of those movies where I read the synopsis beforehand to see if I could mentally handle it, only to come to the conclusion that I really would not be able to. Aside from that, this is certainly one original movie. No other movie parallels. If that makes you want to watch people’s mouths get sewn to each other’s buttocks, then be my guest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/S5CxpGKNuioframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/S5CxpGKNuio\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p><strong>“Rodentz”</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t think much needs to be said for this movie. Anything that features a “z” at the end of its title should not be trusted. Period.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There you have it: a list of horror flicks that may possibly put you at the risk of a brain hemorrhage. But do not give up hope — this is only the tip of the Netflix iceberg. So many other under-the-radar flicks lay in wait for you on your Halloween night.

Most coverage of the massively successful 30-minute video has been extremely negative, criticizing the video’s questionable message and Invisible Children itself. As a San Diego native, where IC is headquartered, I am very familiar with the nonprofit. I first heard about the company during my freshman year of high school, around the time it was founded in 2005.</p>\n<p>IC’s three young creators, San Diegans Jason Russell, Ben Keesey and Chris Carver, filmed a documentary about child soldiers in northern Uganda in 2003. After returning to California, they set up a nonprofit company and screened the film to as many people as possible, attempting to raise awareness of the Ugandans’ plight. The main operations of IC at its start were to screen the documentary, give talks to raise awareness of northern Uganda and sell bracelets made by Ugandans — providing employment to locals and visibility for their company. This idea of “raising awareness” is key to many nonprofits, especially with issues international in nature, and people mainly rely on some larger force to make a difference. IC also encouraged writing letters and calling government representatives to bring change in Uganda.</p>\n<p>During high school, I became extremely involved with Invisible Children. It was a nonprofit aimed at teens, with a media-savvy style and attractive, relatable founders, which successfully engaged the apathetic youth, who were largely uninterested in charity work. After my friends and I saw the film, we immediately bought the bracelets and told everyone we knew about it. The documentary also spurred my deeper interest in African politics. I joined my high school’s Model United Nations club, attended local African events and began researching the situation in various African countries. I even met Benjamin Ajak, one of the “Lost Boys from Sudan” and co-author of They Poured Fire on Us From the Sky.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When I came to UCSB, I lost touch with IC and African politics, but always supported the company and its message. I had heard of the KONY 2012 campaign from friends who were still involved in IC, and I “attended” the event on Facebook and re-blogged the video in an act of lazy support. It seems many did the same, as the video became an Internet sensation, bringing Invisible Children into a harsh spotlight.</p>\n<p>While I am not an expert or a proponent of KONY 2012, I still do not completely understand why the video brought such intense hatred of IC. The loudest critique I’ve heard is on the video’s “oversimplification” of the situation in northern Uganda. Filmmaker Jason Russell retorted, “It’s oversimplified for a reason,” being they hoped to spread a general message quickly and easily to encourage people to personally investigate further. I agree with Russell’s justification, since their initial documentary spurred great interest and action in me. Many also criticize IC’s use of social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter to spread the message. This confuses me, as these sites are generously employed by every major news organization (even the president) to quickly spread information. It also corresponds with IC’s aim to target a young audience. I personally believe that any awareness, even through “cheap” mass-marketing websites, is beneficial not only to IC in gaining supporters, but also in compelling people who have never heard of northern Uganda to learn more.</p>\n<p>Though Invisible Children has a special significance to me, I absolutely love that people are questioning and criticizing this nonprofit. In order to keep companies and governments honest, it is imperative that individuals probe below the surface instead of passively accepting “universal truths.” But this also means citizens must question these independent examinations as well and make up their own minds about the issue. The explosion of media coverage on KONY 2012 has proven this passion for legitimacy. But don’t take my word for it …</p>\n<p>Corie Anderson is a third-year film and media studies major.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45941\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-09/denying-invisible-childrens-success-spreading-word-kony/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45941\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-09/denying-invisible-childrens-success-spreading-word-kony/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-09/denying-invisible-childrens-success-spreading-word-kony/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-09/denying-invisible-childrens-success-spreading-word-kony/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-09/denying-invisible-childrens-success-spreading-word-kony/","id":6047,"author":{"id":510,"name":"Corie Anderson"},"related":[6046,6045,6044],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Banishing the No- Prefix Once and For All: Alternatives to Next Year’s Floatopia","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Another year has gone by, and once again Floatopia was successfully banned.

That’s three years now, which in my opinion is pretty damn depressing. As a third-year student, I got here just in time for it to be banned, which is how I would imagine it would feel like being Charlie in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” if instead Willy Wonka had just been like, “Fuck you, Charlie. I changed my mind. No one’s coming in,” and then surrounded the factory with cops.</p>\n<p>In addition, and adding insult to injury, I went to Cal Poly’s Cesar Chavez day over the break, and it was awesome. I don’t like to admit that Cal Poly does anything better than us, but, I mean … they might kind of be doing a half decent job with their beach party. So, to help us get back on track, I’ve brainstormed some other ideas for annual spring events that maybe we could have instead … Or threaten to have.</p>\n<p><strong>New Floatopia Ideas:</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em> Goat-topia</em></p>\n<p>In this version, we get ancient Greek as fuck. Everyone puts on togas, we drink a bunch of wine, and then as an entire student body, we go kill all of the goats that are out by Sands and eat them. Preferably with large fires that we cook them over. It’ll be fun. If you’re vegan and against this, then it’s not like any of us wanted to hang out with you anyway. And the goats are totally cool with it; I asked them and they didn’t say no. By being vegan, you’re ignoring the goats’ freedom of choice and ability to consent to being eaten.</p>\n<p><em>Blow-topia</em></p>\n<p>This one’s pretty simple: Lots of cocaine. LOTS OF IT.</p>\n<p><em>Bro-topia</em></p>\n<p>Some might argue this is the ‘topia we already host every year. Due to a definite increase in the number of tattooed douchebags wandering the street asking, “Where’s the party at?” I’d say there might be some truth in that assumption.</p>\n<p>However, I’d argue this: We can do it better.</p>\n<p>Instead of passively allowing bros to come, this time we actively recruit them. Everyone invites as many out-of-town bros as possible. NO GIRLS. Absolutely no out-of-town girls allowed (this will make sense in a second). Once your bros are adequately hammered, preferably off tequila, bring them to DP, where the DJs will be playing a specific playlist of only Skrillex songs. This should lead to the perfect storm — thousands of confused, drunk bros getting increasingly confused and angry, because — “Why are my eight bros and I not getting laid by beautiful blonde bikini models like we imagined?” They’ll begin to try to think of a reason, but then quickly remember that thinking is difficult and it’s easier to just get really angry. But I FUCKING LOVE Skrillex, they’ll think to themselves. This song is FUCKING SICK. I’M SO PUMPED up. Hey. HEY! HEY DID YOU JUST HIT MY FUCKING SHOULDER, BRO?! BRO, THAT GUY JUST HIT MY FUCKING SHOULDER. And BAM! The show is on!</p>\n<p>Sexual frustration + drunkenness + thousands of bros = biggest bro fight ever. With no women to hold their attention, none of the surrounding bros will be able to keep themselves from joining in after whichever short-tempered bro throws the first punch. And this should be pretty awesome to watch, as long as it’s safely from an upstairs deck. I imagine we’ll be able to actually taste the testosterone in the air. As a prize, I say last man standing at the end of it gets crowned King Bro and is given the sorority girl of his choice — who, lets face it, is totally down for him anyway.</p>\n<p><em>Ho-topia</em></p>\n<p>Ok, once again, this miiiight be the one we already throw every year. But personally I think our women are classier than that. To be totally honest, I don’t exactly have any real ideas for it because I imagine it would look something like a “Girls Gone Wild” video. And if I knew how to create THAT, I wouldn’t be wasting my time writing this right now.</p>\n<p><em>No-topia</em></p>\n<p>Maybe if an unnamed individual wouldn’t make a public Facebook event every year, this is the event that authorities would THINK we were putting on, and then we could go ahead and have an awesome beach day in the ocean instead. But apparently that’s impossible, so I guess we can just completely forget it. FORGET USING LOGIC.</p>\n<p><em>Glow-topia</em></p>\n<p>We specify a weekend night to turn off all the lights in I.V., and everyone wears glow stuff.</p>\n<p>I was writing this as a joke, but this one actually sounds kind of awesome. We should probably actually do this.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In closing, that sums up my ideas for alternate spring festivities. Basically I can’t think of anything else good that rhymes with “flo.” However, if you can think of any I missed, please write to the Nexus and make sure they know.</p>\n<p>However, to conclude the entire thing, I would like to provide one more last idea. This year “Deltopia” somehow ended up on Easter weekend. This was a horrible combination, needless to say. However, if it does by chance fall on Easter weekend again next year, I think that maybe we should take advantage of the unique situation. We should seize the opportunity to celebrate both Easter and Floatopia at once — by getting drunk and crucifying whoever makes a public Floatopia Facebook event.</p>\n<p><em>George Publius is a third-year student.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45977\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-10/banishing-prefix-alternatives-years-floatopia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45977\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-10/banishing-prefix-alternatives-years-floatopia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-10/banishing-prefix-alternatives-years-floatopia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-10/banishing-prefix-alternatives-years-floatopia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-10/banishing-prefix-alternatives-years-floatopia/","id":6048,"author":{"id":511,"name":"George Publius"},"related":[6047,6046,6045],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
