In total, Boone threw eight and one-third innings of shutout baseball, along with a career-high 12 strikeouts. The key ingredient to Boone’s success on Saturday was his changeup, with Boone generating 18 swings and misses on his secondary pitch.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coach talked to me about throwing my changeup to look like a fastball and to keep my arm speed good on my off-speed,” Boone told KCSB’s Max Kelton after the game, when asked about the effectiveness of the pitch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did a freshman pitcher — one who merely throws for average velocity — pitch the game that clinched the Gauchos their first conference title in 33 years? Part of the answer lies with a slim, self-described nerd by the name of Tony Ortiz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of enjoying the title with the team on Saturday, Ortiz was perched high up in the bleachers, recording every single pitch and swing during the game — just as he’s done all season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite only being a third-year, Ortiz has flourished this year as the Undergraduate Analytics Manager for the UCSB baseball team. Since 2017 — when former Director of Analytics Evan Short took over the position — UCSB has become the most analytically driven baseball program on the West Coast. Short pushed the coaching staff to raise the money to ensure that Santa Barbara has state-of-the-art equipment, including tools like TrackMan and Rapsodo that major league teams use for their statistics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past year, however, Short received an offer to help build the Toronto Blue Jays’ analytics department — an offer too good to turn down. After two years of revolutionizing Santa Barbara’s analytics usage, Short left for Major League Baseball, leaving a gaping hole for the baseball program to fill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter Ortiz.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Ortiz first joined the baseball staff last year, he was a baseball operations intern, helping out with whatever he could around the office. But when Short knew he was leaving, he began to groom Ortiz to take over his role with the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At first, I was only occasionally working with [Short], and it was more on the baseball side of things because I didn’t have the experience with statistics or programming,” Ortiz said. “Towards the end, however, I was writing reports to provide to the coaches so they had more information about what the players needed to work on during the season.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a team of four interns at his disposal, Ortiz’s main job is to be the liaison between the hard data and the coaching staff, turning the code written by his interns into easily interpretable and digestible bites for the coaches to understand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes my interns will come up with a report, and it will still be marked with the code they wrote,” Ortiz said. “I love seeing how they did it, but when it comes to giving it to the coaching staff, I tell them we need to get rid of all of that and just get to the point.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somehow, Ortiz manages to juggle his responsibilities as Undergraduate Analytics Manager with being a full-time statistics student at UCSB. In a typical day, Ortiz will go to the baseball office to upload and analyze videos, go to class and then head to the stadium to record statistics for the live bullpen sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The interns have been extremely helpful in my adjustment to this position,” Ortiz said. “It’s really nice to be able to rely on them for help, because it gives me more time to do the actual analysis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite his packed schedule, Ortiz thrives because of his unmitigated love for the sport of baseball. Before I could even ask  my first question prior to the game on Saturday, Ortiz unpacked the Gauchos’ devastating loss on Friday to me, explaining how UCSB’s high-risk, high reward-style offense ultimately backfired. While he uses some data in his analysis, Ortiz makes it clear that his love for baseball stretches beyond just a trendline or chart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think all the time that if I could play, I would give up all the analytic stuff to play just because I love the game that much,” Ortiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his passion and his drive, Ortiz has seamlessly filled in for Short, supplying data and analysis to the coaching staff whenever he can. Perhaps most importantly, the coaching staff has directly utilized the analysis Ortiz and his team provide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a more traditional game like baseball, some pundits and coaches are apprehensive to turn the game over to hard data and numbers. But under the direction of Head Coach Andrew Checketts, UCSB has wholeheartedly embraced the data revolution in baseball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coach Checketts and the coaching staff are very reasonable, and if they see something with evidence, they are going to take it and run with it,” Ortiz said. “The coaches have their own ideas of what the players should work on, and then they can use the analytics as support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, a data analytics team is nothing if the players themselves don’t buy in and aren’t willing to learn from data rather than relying on raw intuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps no player has embraced data as much as Boone has in his first year at Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Boone is a perfect example of a player where you can’t see how good he is until you look at his analytics numbers,” Ortiz said. “He’s not a flamethrower, but he has a wrinkle on his fastball — a little movement — that makes it harder to hit than just a regular fastball.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boone came into Santa Barbara without a plus fastball, but the analytics team broke down videos in the offseason to try to help the coaches develop his secondary pitches, including his changeup — the very changeup that played a vital role in Boone’s start on Saturday. Despite being completely behind-the-scenes, those video breakdowns ended up helping UCSB take home the Big West title for the first time in 33 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Ortiz’s main goals for next season is to incorporate more video and advanced statistics into the offensive side of things for the Gauchos.

Buckley was 260-231-1 during his tenure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since his firing, however, LBSU has managed to turn things around a bit. After starting the season 5-26, Long Beach State has won six of its last 15 games, including a sweep of UC Riverside — the only team to take two of three from the Gauchos this season — and nearly knocking off No. 1 UCLA this past Tuesday, losing in 12 innings 2-1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That may not seem like much, but it does highlight about how far this program has come in just the past month of play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, even in those 15 contests, LBSU has tallied 130 hits which is about eight hits per game, a solid number.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team’s .259 batting average as a whole might not seem great over the past 15, but it is up more than 48 points than where it was before. Overall, the team sports a .234 batting average which is dead last in the conference but, again, higher than it was before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LBSU’s pitching staff has also been revived during conference play. The Dirtbags have allowed the second-least hits (121) in conference play. The staff also holds the second-best ERA (4.67).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, despite LBSU’s record, the team does put up a fight in each contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twelve of Long Beach State’s last 15 games have been decided by two runs or fewer, with seven of those meetings being decided by just one run. The Dirtbags have gone just 1-6 in those seven one-run games and are 3-2 in matches decided by two runs over that span.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a few more things go right for them in some of these games, LBSU might be contending for a title as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, UCSB should still roll through the Dirtbags. The Gauchos’ pitching staff has combined to strike out 399 batters this season, topping the Big West. LBSU strikes out a good amount with 323 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, Santa Barbara’s offensive firepower might be too much for the Dirtbags to even think of overcoming.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right fielder Armani Smith has been on a tear lately as he currently owns a nine-game hitting streak. During that stretch, Smith has had five multiple hit games and gone an impressive 14 for 34 (.411) while also scoring seven runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This recent stretch has also seen his batting average jump 24 points as he now sports a .319 batting average.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Martinez, Calif. native has accumulated one fourth of his total RBIs this season in just the last nine games for a total of 10. Smith also has 10 homers on the season, second best mark on the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the Gauchos have been especially tough to beat at home, owning an impressive 22-1 record in home games this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has won 15 consecutive games in Santa Barbara with the team’s last home loss coming on Mar. 17 against Cal Baptist. If the team can sweep, UCSB will have set a new program record for most consecutive wins at home in a single season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos last set that record in 2016 when they won 17 consecutive games. That was the same year UCSB went to its first ever College World Series. Coincidence? I guess we’ll find out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First pitch between LBSU and UCSB will begin at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 10 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Instead, Cal Poly concludes its season 28-28 overall and 17-7 in Big West play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite it being senior day for the Gauchos, it was the young freshman on the mound who really solidified this win for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Left-handed pitcher Rodney Boone pitched an amazing game Saturday. In possibly the biggest game of his career, the freshman tossed 8.1 innings, striking out a career-high 12 batters and allowing just five hits and three walks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the plate, UCSB tallied a solid 10 hits to score seven runs. In the previous two games of the series, Santa Barbara had just eight hits and three runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The run support for Boone came early; in the bottom of the first inning, the Gauchos were able to get two across the plate, thanks to an RBI single from sophomore infielder Andrew Martinez and an RBI groundout from junior right fielder Armani Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the third, two more were runs scored for UCSB due to RBI singles from Smith and junior center fielder Tommy Jew. Jew was one of the six Santa Barbara athletes to be celebrated on Senior Day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were hoping to chill today and relax with our families but we had to come in ready and locked in. To be able to celebrate with everyone is special,” Jew said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other honorees include right-handed pitchers Alex Patterson, Liam Steigerwald, Kevin Chandler, left fielder Michael McAdoo and left fielder Tevin Mitchell. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Jew, the junior went two for four on the day to finish the regular season batting .282 with 39 RBI’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two more runs came across in the fourth, following a triple from shortstop McClain O’Connor which brought in both a run and a sacrifice fly from Martinez to bring in O’Connor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, in the seventh, Mitchell blasted his fifth home run of the year to left field, giving his team a commanding 7-0 lead. Mitchell was a standout player for UCSB all year hitting his career-high five home runs and tying the team lead in stolen bases at 20.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As dominant as Boone was, it appeared that Checketts would let him finish the outing off. Instead, the plan was to let him get one final out before bringing in closer Chris Lincoln to finish off the score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After striking out the leadoff batter, Boone got the call and left the field to a standing ovation for his performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was an awesome moment and an amazing feeling,” Boone said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lincoln came in needing just two outs to finish off the Mustangs. He struck out the first batter then got the final one to ground to third. Third baseman Jason Willow picked up the ball, spun around and launched it to Kyle Johnson at first who secured the catch for the final out of the ball game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team was all smiles after the ball game, with many players hugging each other and the championship trophy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t explain it. This is probably the happiest I have been in years. I love each and every one of these guys and I just could not be happier,” senior Thomas Rowan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rowan was honored last year on Senior day which is why he did not participate in the activities today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past eight seasons, Checketts has accomplished a considerable amount since becoming the head coach of the program. He led the program to many bests including most wins in a single season at the Division 1 level with 45 wins this year and even its first-ever College World Series in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But getting the program’s first Big West title in 30-plus years is very special and a testament to how far this team has come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, UCSB moves onto bigger things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We struggled with our identities the past few years but this year we found it. If you’re going to come at us, you better give us your best because we are a resilient team and we don’t care who we play in the regionals. We just want to show what we got,” Jew said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will find out whether or not they host a regional on Sunday evening at 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. The team will then find out its bracket at 9 a.m. Monday morning. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

It showed I can’t take anything for granted.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, Yang finished the 2018 season with a .244 average and — more importantly — a chip on his shoulder heading into the offseason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang’s belief in his own abilities never faltered; before this season, he stated that one of his goals was to be nominated for the Buster Posey award — given to the top catcher in college baseball. To an outsider, the thought of a recently-benched catcher becoming one of the top catchers in the nation would have seemed absurd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Yang worked at it, tinkering with his swing in the offseason. One day, senior and fellow catcher Thomas Rowan suggested that Yang use his legs more during his swing. Desperate to find anything that worked, Yang gave it a go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, Yang hit two home runs during the team’s scrimmage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of messing with his mechanics, Yang also changed his approach at the plate, inspired in large part by new hitting coach Donegal Fergus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our offensive style is a lot more aggressive this year than it was in the past,” Yang said. “In years past, the staff just wanted us to put the balls in play and not strike out. This year, they want us to hit it in the air and hit home runs. They want us to hit it as hard as we can and not get cheated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change in approach has completely altered the way Yang hits the ball. Last year, Yang grounded out 33 times, with only 39 flyouts. This year, however, he has grounded out 35 times while flying out 62 times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A ground ball does nothing for me, because I’m not fast, so I might as well have my misses in the air,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This significant uptick in fly balls also directly correlates to an increase in power for Yang. After not hitting a single home run last year, Yang has gone deep seven times this season while contributing 45 RBIs. Even when he isn’t going yard, Yang has an uncanny knack for finding the gap, with the backstop tied for the team lead with 16 doubles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most impressively, Yang’s increase in power hasn’t coincided with a decrease in average, with the catcher hitting an eye-popping .383 out of the three-hole for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang’s contributions to UCSB’s historic season go far beyond just his bat however. This year, Checketts has allowed Yang to start calling games behind the plate, and the junior has rewarded that trust by helping create one of the strongest pitching staffs in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really close to all of the pitchers, and I even live with [Chris] Lincoln and [Jack] Dashwood, and I think we really bring that chemistry to the mound,” Yang said. “Because our pitching staff is so reliable, it allows me to focus more on hitting [instead of] babysitting the pitchers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defensively, Yang has always been above average; this year the catcher sports a sparkling .995 fielding percentage, as well as an impressive 34.5  caught stealing percentage. Despite his numbers, Yang still believes he has room for improvement on the defensive end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve always been able to throw, so that [caught stealing] number is honestly lower than I’d like it to be,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it is this drive to be the very best that makes Yang one of the best catchers in the entire country — something that his recent accolades reflect. Last week, Yang accomplished his preseason goal when he was selected as a semifinalist for the Buster Posey award, alongside 13 other catchers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone on that list is a great player, so it was super cool to see my name on there as well,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Just yesterday, as if Yang’s season wasn’t already impressive enough, the veteran backstop was named the 2019 Big West Field Player of the Year, becoming the first Gaucho to win the award since Cameron Newell in 2015.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From getting benched halfway through the season to being named the best field player in the conference, perhaps no player in college baseball has improved as much as Yang.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Behind Yang’s resurgent bat, calming presence and consistent defense, UCSB looks poised to make a deep postseason run. And if Yang can keep up this pace, that run could end in a national title.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_6321.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1690333678\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"88824\"> </a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
