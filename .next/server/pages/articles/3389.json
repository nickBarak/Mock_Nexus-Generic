However, the contract allowed HOPR to cancel at any time, as long as it gives the university 60-day notice, according to Chelsea Davidoff, a HOPR representative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main challenge was economic, ridership revenue is not enough to pay the bills. This is true for most transit modes,” Davidoff said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although HOPR’s ridership was not considered a problem, revenue from riders was not sufficient enough to cover operating costs, according to James Wagner, program manager for the Transportation Alternatives Program (T.A.P.) at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most bicycle-share programs on college campuses need subsidies to survive and keep their rates affordable to customers, due to the expensive cost of buying and maintaining shared bicycles, Wagner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The HOPR contract contemplated securing a sponsor but since they didn’t get one, the program was not economically feasible. As such they requested to cancel the contract,” Wagner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB T.A.P. plans to replace HOPR’s service with another bicycle rental company, </span><a href=\"https://www.bcycle.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BCycle</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the future, Wagner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transportation &amp; Parking Services currently does not have room in its budget to front the cost for a bicycle-share program, Wagner said. HOPR did not initially ask for a subsidy because it expected to secure a sponsor, which is why it was contracted, Davidoff added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“HOPR provided an option to the University to sponsor or subsidize the program as part of the transportation budget, but this budget was not available,” Wagner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We may open another request for proposals (RFP) to see if other bicycle share vendors are willing to provide bicycle share at no cost to the university besides user fees,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recognized as a Platinum-level Bicycle Friendly University by the League of American Bicyclists</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Part of this recognition is due to the large number of bicycles available to share on campus through HOPR, according to Wagner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HOPR remains in other cities and universities throughout the country where it has found more economic success, such as UC Los Angeles, the University of South Florida and the cities of Santa Monica, Atlanta and Orlando, according to Davidoff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidoff said that despite the early contract termination, HOPR leaves UCSB thankful for the opportunity from the university and support from students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope they find a budget for bike share, students love it, it is affordable, healthy, fun and environmentally friendly. If there is a will, there’s always a way,” Davidoff said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div

Graduate students have been organizing the demands since Jan. 21, when students held a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“sick-out”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of UCSC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily, a first-year sociology graduate student who declined to give her last name, spoke to the crowd at the University Library on Monday about how the list of demands was created, noting that it was important that as many graduate student voices as possible were included. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We read all the comments on the 994 surveys we got, we took it into consideration, we wrote these and this is what we came up with,” Emily told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All campuses across UC are organizing in some way for this COLA, and that’s how we’re going to get strength and prove to the administration that something’s got to change if we stand together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lex Taylor, a third-year political science and economics major, also spoke to the crowd in front of the library, representing a handful of undergraduate students who marched in solidarity with graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are mostly taught by grad students. These are the people making sure this university is working … that we are going into our classes getting the education we deserve,” Taylor said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taylor also referenced the three-year long </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strike efforts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union as a sign that COLA efforts can be successful too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME, for the last three years, striked on and off, and they won. Right now at Santa Cruz, grad students are starting to strike, we are about to give our demands all across the UCs and grad students are showing what they can do,” Taylor added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Emily read the demands aloud and several graduate students spoke regarding the need for COLA, the group marched from the University Library to the fifth floor of Cheadle Hall, where students presented the list of demands to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond asking for a COLA, the students’ demands included several stipulations: that the COLA amount will be recalculated annually to account for increases in housing costs, that a COLA will not come from an increase in graduate or undergraduate tuition, that the university will not retaliate in any form against those supporting or participating in the demand for a COLA and that the university will accommodate the higher financial needs of graduate students with children or dependent adults.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand letter also highlighted the COLA’s necessity and explained that the amount comes from calculating average graduate student income and housing costs in the local area, to determine what amount is necessary per month to keep graduate students from rent burden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter explained that the baseline for a rent burden is 31%, meaning that 31% or more of an individual’s income goes towards housing. However, the average rent burden for graduate students at UCSB is 51%, as calculated by UAW 2865.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stipend necessary to alleviate rent burden at UCSB is the fourth-highest stipend estimate in the UC system, behind Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Los Angeles, according to the UAW report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students earn their income from a variety of different funding sources, such as fellowships, grants, teaching assistant positions and research. Because sources of income vary from student to student and may change on a quarterly basis, UCSB graduate students emphasized in the demands letter that they are asking for a cost-of-living adjustment that is dispersed each month through the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All UCSB graduate students, “regardless of their graduate program, department, year in program, residence, visa category, documentation, funding source, and employment status,” will receive the same COLA amount, according to demands.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email statement, UC Office of the President Associate Director for Media Relations Andrew Gordon stated that the strike at UCSC is “illegal,” adding that it “does not further the discussion on how to increase housing affordability for student employees.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon explained that the university reached a four-year contract with UAW in August 2018 and that the contract is in place through June 2020.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>What’s the Catch? by Kendra Jackson</strong></p>\n<p>It was Super Bowl LI. Everyone was speechless. The Patriots were getting smoked by the Atlanta Falcons.<br>\nTom Brady had been rushed, sacked and picked off all within the span of the first half, and it seemed as though Super Bowl victory No. 5 was just about out of reach for the New England Patriots.<br>\nThe score was 28-3 late in the third quarter, and nobody expected a blowout this bad.<br>\nComing back from such a big deficit would have been an impossible feat for most teams and for most quarterbacks … but not for Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.<br>\nNew England had scored 17 unanswered points, and it was officially a ball game.<br>\nThat’s when it happened. One of the most amazing moments in Super Bowl history.<br>\nThe Patriots were 64 yards from the end zone and were facing an 8-point deficit.<br>\nJust 2:28 was left in regulation, and the offense for New England was set. Shot gun formation – Brady set and ready to throw a bullet.<br>\nJulian Edelman was the intended receiver, but he was surrounded by three Falcons.<br>\nRobert Alford, the Falcons corner who picked off Brady in the first half, made what would have been one of the biggest ball deflections in his entire career. He hit the football as it was spiraling in the air, and it looked as if he had ruined the hopes of New England, all with a bat of the ball.<br>\nBut Alford didn’t pick the ball this time, he just deflected it in the air; the ball was still in play and fair game to be caught.<br>\nRegardless of all the traffic, Edelman managed to make one of the most prodigious catches in Super Bowl history.<br>\nEdelman was able to grab the batted ball, put his hand under it, secure it and prevent it from touching the ground.<br>\nIn that very moment, I knew, and everyone watching knew, that the Patriots were going to come back and win this game.<br>\nThat catch set up the tying touchdown that eventually led to the first overtime period in Super Bowl history, and another Lombardi Trophy for New England.<br>\nThat 23-yard pass across the middle was the fairytale to end what was a rollercoaster season for the Patriots. From the Deflategate scandal to Brady’s resulting suspension, New England wanted this one bad – and that catch made sure it happened.<br>\nIn the words of Patriots owner Robert Kraft, this win was “unequivocally the sweetest.”</p>\n<p><strong>Party Like It’s 1985 by Andrew Bishop</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To football fans of the 21st century, the idea of the Chicago Bears blowing out the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl seems almost unheard of. However, at the end of the 1985 season in Super Bowl XX, the Monsters of the Midway bullied the Patriots to a 46-10 victory.<br>\nEvery Chicago Bears fan who was alive in 1985 remembers the Bears’ triumphant quest for the Lombardi Trophy, and even those like myself who were born after their victory grew up hearing tales of the famed team that won the Bears their first and only Super Bowl.<br>\nScholars of the game regard the ’85 Bears as being one of the greatest teams in the history of the NFL. Much like the Patriots of today, everyone was betting on the Bears to win in ’85. Led by legendary head coach Mike Ditka, the Bears’ defense terrorized opposing teams in ways nobody had ever seen before, and their offense was carried almost singlehandedly by the immortal Walter Payton, the greatest professional running back of all time.<br>\nThroughout the season, the Bears dominated on the field, going 15-1 and leading the league on defense, and off the field, where Bears players recorded a Grammy-nominated hit single that raised over $300,000 for Chicago charities. Unlike the Patriots, who are viewed as the proverbial “bad guys” of the NFL, the ’85 Bears were lovable and dominant, and America couldn’t get enough of them.<br>\nThere were many great moments throughout the Bears’ season, Grammy nomination included, but the most memorable moment of all came in the third quarter of Super Bowl XX. Following a fumble recovery by Bears linebacker Wilber Marshall, the Bears managed to march down to the Patriots 1-yard line, where they employed their secret weapon: William Perry, a 6’2”, 350-pound defensive tackle-turned running back.<br>\nPerry, better known by his endearing nickname “The Fridge,” was one of the largest players to ever set foot on a professional football field, and Coach Ditka had the brilliant idea to give this monstrous human being the ball on the goal line. Outweighing nearly every opposing defender by over 100 pounds, the Fridge took the handoff and plowed through the line like a bowling ball, stumbling into the end zone for a touchdown.<br>\nThe nation erupted in collective laughter as the athletic giant ran over his opposition and capped his score off with a ball spike that puts Rob Gronkowski’s to shame. Despite lasting no more than a few seconds, that goal line play is remembered by football fans throughout the nation for all of eternity.<br>\nThe ’85 Bears are worshipped by fans throughout the nation, and reruns of the Patriots’ demolition in Super Bowl XX still play in American households to this day. It was an undeniably memorable season, which was capped off in spectacular fashion with a touchdown scored by a man the size of a refrigerator.</p>\n<p><strong>PATS INT SAVES THE DAY by Spencer Ault</strong></p>\n<p>It’s a little difficult for me to pick just one Super Bowl moment in particular as my favorite.<br>\nI’m a Patriots fan, see, which means that not only am I incredibly obnoxious, but I also have a lot of good moments to choose from.<br>\nThe Adam Vinatieri field goals are pretty good, if a little fuzzy, and the whole fourth quarter against the Falcons was pretty amazing.<br>\nThe top spot, however, is reserved for the Malcolm Butler interception to win Super Bowl XLIX.<br>\nI was a junior in high school, only just starting to worry about getting into college.<br>\nI was actually enrolled in an SAT prep class that met on Sunday nights, even on Sunday nights that happened to be the Super Bowl.<br>\nI started the game off at a friend’s house, but I went back home to be with my mostly Patriot-supporting family after a tough third quarter put New England behind 24-14.<br>\nMy friends all hated the Patriots, rightfully so, and I wanted to be in a friendlier environment.<br>\nI could barely remember the Patriots’ three Super Bowl wins but I could definitely remember the two losses, and I wasn’t looking forward to a repeat of that feeling.<br>\nAs the Seahawks drove into Patriot territory late in the game, however, it looked as though that was what I was in for.<br>\nThe insane Jermaine Kearse catch, where he managed to catch a deflected pass by kicking it to himself while lying flat on his back, just reinforced my sense of doom.<br>\nThe Seahawks inched closer to the end zone, and I started resigning myself to a depressing SAT class.<br>\nThen Malcolm Butler undercut Kearse’s slant at the goal line and intercepted the ball with 20 seconds left in the game.<br>\nI went nuts, running around the house while my dad just stood there in disbelief.<br>\nThe feeling just got better as the Patriots ran down the clock and my family continued to celebrate. Then I immediately got in my car and drove to my class, blasting music and singing the whole way.<br>\nIt was the first Super Bowl win I was really conscious for, and it was amazing.<br>\nBeing at home made it even more special, pushing it over the top in my memory banks.<br>\nIf all goes right, I’ll have another good memory after Sunday, but it’s hard to see anything topping that interception.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Feb. 1</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80719\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80719\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/","id":3388,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[3387,3386,3385],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
