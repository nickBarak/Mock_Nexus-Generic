Our defense, energy, and everything about us is getting better and better.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, which was 3-5 and in sixth place in conference to begin the month of February, now improves to 7-5 in the Big West with an overall record of 13-12. The Gauchos are two games back from second place UC Irvine and Long Beach State, both hosting a Big West record of 9-3.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Aggies, 10-16 overall, lose their fourth straight game and drop to a conference record of 5-8.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gotten back over the break even mark and that’s a very good thing,” Williams stated. “I thought we played really hard tonight. We didn’t shoot well, which they had a lot to do with, but we played very hard.”</p>\n<p>While it wasn’t the cleanest first half for either team, committing a total of 21 turnovers, the Gauchos jumped out to a 31-20 advantage at halftime due to the shooting hand of Vincent. The shooting guard out of Stockton, CA went 4-7 from the field scoring seven of his teams first 13 points. Vincent led all scorers at the break with 10 points.</p>\n<p>Drawing two early fouls and struggling to find his rhythm offensively, senior guard Michael Bryson made his presence known in other categories during the first half. The 6’4” wing recorded seven rebounds, two blocks, and three steals. Bryson also hit home six of his teams seven free throws in the first period, going a perfect six-for six behind the free throw stripe.</p>\n<p>Facing an uphill battle similar to their match on Thursday, the Aggies clawed their way back in the second half this time from 11-points. Davis shaved the Gauchos’ lead down to five with 18:27 to go as junior Brynton Lamar finished strong to the rack and then followed it up with a mid-range jump shot to have his team trail 26-31.</p>\n<p>The third year guard finished second in scoring for Davis on Saturday, one point shy of senior Josh Fox’s team-high 17 points. Not only Lemar keep the game within reach scoring 11 of his 16 points in the second half, the San Diego, CA native earned himself a double-double crashing the boards on offense and defense for a total of 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite a strong effort from Fox and Lemar, the Gauchos ended the game in dramatic fashion as junior guard Eric Childress led a 3-on-2 break and dished a no-look pass to Vincent for the go-ahead dunk with 1:02 remaining. Vincent’s slam magnified UCSB’s lead to 10 after that point.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also had a major boost from its bench, including a 9-point contribution from senior forward Mitch Brewe. The 6’8” senior scored seven of his nine points in the first half and helped add to the Gauchos’ season-high 13 steals with two picks.</p>\n<p>“I just tried to bring a lot of energy physicality, and a big defensive presence [tonight],” Brewe said. “I didn’t do a good job of finishing in the beginning of the game but [afterwards] got in a rhythm a little bit. I think coming off the bench bringing a lot of energy and keeping the level high is really important.”</p>\n<p>“It was a team win for everybody tonight,” said Childress. “We just knew we had to make plays.[Davis] is a physical team and when we have a night like this when we’re not shooting well we have to be aggressive back with them and our bench came in and did that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has outscored its opponents’ bench in each of its last four games, averaging 20.5 points per game. This is a reasonable chunk of their 70.1 point average per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sets foot on its two-game road trip this week starting with a Thursday night match against Cal State Northridge and a Saturday game at Fullerton. The Gauchos game at CSUN will take place in the Matadome at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68480\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68480\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/","id":348,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[347,346,345],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Overcomes Sluggish First Quarter, Emerges for 70-58 Win Over CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensBasketball_1-9-16_1-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 24-6 run in the second quarter of Thursday's game versus Cal State Northridge helped guide the UCSB women's basketball team to its 70-58 victory over the Matadors Thursday night.

Fluker was the only Northridge player to score within double-figures, finishing 10-23 from the field and 11-14 at the free-throw line.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos improved to 10-16 and 7-5 in the Big West, matching its overall win total from the past two seasons. Northridge fell to 6-19 overall, 4-7 in conference play.</p>\n<p>After scoring its first field goal at the 9:30 mark of the game, UCSB was unable to score its next basket until 3:40 remained in the first quarter. While UCSB struggled shooting the ball, CSUN managed to go on a 15-2 run. Helping establish this run was Fluker with nine points in the first quarter as CSUN ended the first period with a 20-6 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite being held to just six points in the first quarter, UCSB answered with some lockdown defense of its own, holding CSUN to just six points in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>“We put good pressure on the guards on the perimeter and made things uncomfortable,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “Our double was good. We turned [Fluker] over three times, got a travel. Just to be disruptive always creates some offense from defense.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara forced 24 turnovers, recorded 14 steals, and outscored CSUN in points off turnovers 30-10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ stout defense helped to resolve their cold shooting start to begin the game as they went on a 7-0 run to open the second period which brought them within a single-figure deficit of 13-20. As UCSB’s scoring run expanded, it ended the second quarter outscoring CSUN 24-6. Prompting UCSB’s scoring stretch was its improvement from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>After going scoreless from beyond the arc in the first 10 minutes of Thursday’s game, Santa Barbara sunk four of its six three-pointers in the second quarter. Igniting the Gauchos’ long-range shooting was freshman guard Coco Miller with two three-pointers. She concluded Thursday with 13 points on a 5-13 overall and 2-7 three-point shooting effort.</p>\n<p>A make from behind the perimeter by senior guard Dioseline Lopez brought the Gauchos within one-point of CSUN’s lead at 22-23.</p>\n<p>In spite of its 0-5 three-point shooting start in the first quarter, UCSB remained committed to its shot selection from beyond the perimeter.</p>\n<p>“I always tell those two [Roper and Miller] to shoot until your arm falls off,” Henrickson said. “Even if you’ve missed three or four, we all expect the next one to go and they have to have that mentality.”</p>\n<p>With a 27-26 lead, it was a three-pointer at the buzzer by Roper that shifted the momentum to UCSB’s advantage while extending the Gauchos’ lead to 30-26 at the half.</p>\n<p>“It all started with our defense, especially because we had a slow start,” Roper said. “Coach [Henrickson] really emphasized pressure on the defensive end in getting us better looks on offense.”</p>\n<p>Roper capitalized off the buzzer shot, scoring UCSB’s first field goal of the second half from beyond the arc while her last three-point basket of the game with 1:15 in the third handed the Gauchos their first double-figure lead of the game at 46-36.</p>\n<p>For the remainder of the game, Northridge trailed by a double-figure deficit. Its ability to get to the free-throw, where it made 11-14 in the second half, did not permit it to keep up with UCSB’s scoring pace.</p>\n<p>Although Fluker registered 19 of her 31 points in the second half, the Matadors were overcome by the Gauchos’ 51.6 field goal percentage in the final two quarters. In addition to Roper and Miller, senior guard Jasmine Ware’s 5-10 shooting performance and total of 10 points off the bench helped UCSB secure its 70-58 victory.</p>\n<p>Next on UCSB’s schedule is Long Beach State this Saturday, Feb. 20 at 2 p.m. The 49ers endured an 83-58 loss to UC Riverside Thursday night, bringing them to 18-7 overall and 7-4 in conference play. UCSB, currently in fifth-place of the Big West standings, could tie LBSU for fourth-place in the conference with a victory on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68413\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68413\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-overcomes-sluggish-first-quarter-emerges-for-70-58-win-over-csun/","id":345,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[344,343,342],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Able to Earn Third-Straight Victory, Win 65-55 on the Road at UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MBasketball_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MBasketball_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the Big West Conference Tournament rapidly approaching, the UCSB men's basketball team is starting to play its best basketball at the right moment.

Seniors Guard Michael Bryson and forward John Green led the way for UCSB, scoring 11 of the team’s first 15 points to help set the Gauchos up with a 15-6 lead prompting them to never trail at any point of Thursday’s contest.</p>\n<p>Bryson scored the first six points for UCSB, including a layup just 18 seconds into the game. Green came off the bench in attack mode, hitting a mid-range jumper and three-pointer all within the 11<sup>th</sup> minute of the first half. The two went 7-11 from the floor in the first half, playing a major role in UCSB’s 29-18 advantage at halftime.</p>\n<p>Senior guard T.J. Taylor also added the exclamation point with seven seconds left in the first. Off a UCR turnover, Taylor went coast-to-coast maneuvering past a defender and hit a buzzer-beating three with one second to spare.</p>\n<p>Taylor tied season-highs with eight points and four assists in nineteen minutes off the bench.</p>\n<p>While the Highlanders had their troubles in the first half, shooting 7-28 from the field, guards Gentrey Thomas and Jaylen Bland helped turn things around. Riverside chipped at its 11-point deficit as Thomas connected on a three-point shot followed by a strong finish to the rim. This five-point swing helped pull the score to 32-30 with 16:40 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Helping bring UCR within the Gauchos’ lead was the Highlanders’ senior captain in Bland. With 6:40 left in regulation, Bland knocked down his 100<sup>th</sup> three-pointer of the season, a Big West best, to trim UCSB’s lead to 50-44 with 6:40 to go.</p>\n<p>While Bland entered Thursday with the fourth-best scoring average in the Big West of 16.5 points per game, the Murray State transfer did not have the most efficient shooting night from the floor, going 4-15 overall and 3-11 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Bland has had a rocky scoring stretch during his past three games, averaging 8.3 points per game including a 1-8 shooting night and season-low five points against Cal Poly on Feb. 13.</p>\n<p>With the Highlanders quickly on its heels, Santa Barbara converted at the free-throw line going 11-12 in the final six minutes to secure its victory. Overall, UCSB went 18-25 from behind the free-throw line, including the reliable foul shooting of senior forward Sam Beeler, who hit four of his six made free-throws in the last five minutes of play.</p>\n<p>With the absence of Johns, the Highlanders relied heavily on junior forward Secean Johnson to keep UCR within reach.

We forced her middle to her left hand which is where she wants to go and it’s an And-1. Just undisciplined.”</p>\n<p>Hope remained on the UCSB sideline as junior point guard Onome Jemerigbe dashed coast to coast for the game-tying layup with 10 seconds to send the game into overtime. But the Gauchos’ comeback chances were ended when 49ers’ junior forward Madison Montgomery rejected the layup attempt prompting the game’s ending with a 58-55 LBSU victory after a made free-throw by junior guard Anna Kim.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 10-17 overall and 7-6 in the Big West. Long Beach State improved to 19-7 and 8-4 in conference play.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s loss made the race for a top-four seed in the Big West Conference standings more challenging for the Gauchos as they missed out on the opportunity to tie the 49ers for fourth-place. In addition to UC Davis losing to UCR, Long Beach State was able to move up to third-place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>However, during Saturday’s post-game interview, Coach Henrickson assured the media that the team’s standing was the least of her worries with three games remaining in the regular season.</p>\n<p>“The best thing we could have done was beat Long Beach [Saturday],” Henrickson said. “I’ve looked at the format, but I need to focus on us playing better. I don’t get caught up in all of that. If we play well, all that will take care of itself.”</p>\n<p>The format of the Big West Tournament permits the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds to skip the first two rounds of the tournament onto the semifinal. As for the No. 3 and No. 4 seeds, they are granted a first-round bye.</p>\n<p>It is highly unlikely that UCSB will earn a No. 1 or No. 2 seed at this point in the season, but the Gauchos could possibly earn the No. 3 seed or a likely No. 4 seed as UC Davis sits ahead of UCSB in fourth-place at 8-5 in Big West play.</p>\n<p>With low-scoring totals from both teams, the largest lead of Saturday’s game was from Long Beach by a deficit of seven. Three points was the largest scoring differential by quarters as the 49ers narrowly outscored UCSB 16-13 in the third period.</p>\n<p>No player in UCSB’s starting lineup finished with double-figures in points, leaving the offensive duties to the Gauchos’ reserves off the bench.</p>\n<p>Still, UCSB was more efficient shooting the ball than LBSU amassing a 45.2 field goal percentage to the 49ers’ 36.2 percentage. Santa Barbara was able to surpass the 49ers’ full-court press and 2-3 zone defense, but still had 23 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“I thought the press was better at their place,” Henrickson said. “But how many of those [turnovers] are unforced? Travel, dribble pick-ups, and throwing it out of bounds. It’s just undisciplined. That’s my responsibility, I’ve got a role in that as well. They [LBSU] can turn us over, but we turned ourselves over.”</p>\n<p>Leading Santa Barbara in points was senior guard Jasmine Ware with 16 points as she nearly registered her first-career triple-double tallying eight assists and six rebounds as well. Adding to the Gauchos’ production off the bench was Newton, who recorded her second double-double of the season with 14 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Newton’s 6-6 performance at the free throw line in the first half provided the majority of points in Santa Barbara’s 10-2 run, giving it a 27-25 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>In spite of its momentum to close out the first half, UCSB was sluggish in the second half and failed to contain LBSU in the opening of the third quarter, allowing the 49ers to go on a 9-0 run to take a 34-27 lead.</p>\n<p>“I thought we were terrible and we were up by two,” Henrickson said. We had no pop, no energy. [It shows] how consistent you have to be, how well you have to play, and how hard you have to play every single night. We’re not flying around, it’s quiet… that’s frustrating.”</p>\n<p>Yet, UCSB’s 5-0 scoring run after calling a timeout trimmed its deficit to two at 32-34.</p>\n<p>Two quick fouls during the first quarter led to Benton playing in just three minutes of the first half as she sat out the entirety of the second quarter, having taken no shot attempts in the first half.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first half, Benton erupted for all 19 of her points in the second half. She scored the 49ers’ last 11 points of the third quarter and had eight points in the fourth quarter. She concluded Saturday shooting 7-11 from the field and went 5-6 from the free-throw line.</p>\n<p>The 49ers entered Saturday’s matchup shooting over 35 percent from beyond the arc in conference play, but were contained to a 23.5 three-point percentage, going 4-17 from behind the perimeter.</p>\n<p>However, draining two pivotal three-pointers was sophomore guard Gigi Hascheff. She finished the game with 11 points and at one point with 4:47 remaining in the game it was her shot form long-range that handed LBSU a 52-51 lead.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB managed to gain the lead twice after Hascheff’s three-pointer, Benton’s scoring outburst was too much for the Gauchos to contain as she led the 49ers to their 58-55 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play in its last home game of the season this Thursday, Feb. 25 versus UC Irvine at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68501\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68501\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/late-game-lay-up-drowns-ucsb-in-58-55-loss-to-lbsu-saturday/","id":347,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[346,345,344],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
