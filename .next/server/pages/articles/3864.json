Veterans can apply for a new driver’s license or ID card by bringing their DD-214 to a County Veterans Service Office and making an appointment with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The DMV requires veterans to pay a $5 application fee.</p>\n<p>According to California State Assemblymember Jim Frazier, who authored AB 935, the bill allows Californians to fulfill their “responsibility” of ensuring veterans are “well-equipped” for civilian life.</p>\n<p>“Assembly Bill 935 helps us fulfill that pledge to our veterans,” Frazier said in a statement. “Proof of military service is now literally at the individual’s fingertips, which will help ensure that California veterans are receiving all the benefits they’re rightfully entitled to.”</p>\n<p>U.S. Army veteran and engineering graduate student Paul Malone said this legislation frees veterans from needing to have DD-214 certificates on hand in order to enjoy benefits, which he said is a “dumb thing,” because the discharge certificate is a sensitive document, comparable to a birth certificate or Social Security card.</p>\n<p>“Most people carry their licenses with them, which makes this a common sense fix to a problem within our community, assuming it is honored as valid proof,” Malone said in an email.</p>\n<p>Malone said he worries that California lawmakers will “hang their hat” on veterans’ laws now that AB 935’s has passed.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot more to be done just to catch up to other states in terms of what they’re doing for veterans,” Malone said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB Veteran Resource Center counselor and religious studies graduate student Sam Reid said the new veteran license and ID is ultimately “not that big of a deal” for veterans like himself who already carry a United States Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) identification card.</p>\n<p>“If I already have the card, I don’t really need the indicator,” Reid said. “It’s a cool thing, but it’s not some revolutionary game-changer.”</p>\n<p>Reid said he will add the designation to his driver’s license the next time he renews his license at the DMV.</p>\n<p>“I will do that when I renew my license, but I won’t go out of my way,” Reid said.</p>\n<p>U.S. Navy veteran and Chican@ studies Ph.D. candidate Delores Mondragón said AB 935 will especially help female veterans.</p>\n<p>According to Mondragón, she and her husband once tried to get a free coffee at Starbucks on Veterans Day as part of a promotion, and an employee asked Mondragón for pictures of her in uniform, but did not ask her husband for the same.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s an important thing to have, especially for female veterans,” Mondragón said. “I think we have a much harder time being legitimized as veterans.”</p>\n<p>Mondragón also said female veterans are less likely carry alternate forms of identification offered by veteran organizations such as the V.A., the Veterans of Foreign Wars or the American Legion, as they often avoid these organizations because they are “saturated with men.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of women veterans don’t like to be around that many men anymore, especially if we’re the only ones amidst a thousand men,” Mondragón said.</p>\n<p>Mondragón said her biggest concern is that the DMV is charging veterans to apply to add the designation, which she said seems like a “profiteering” scheme.</p>\n<p>“They’re going to make a profit off of what we thought was inherently a necessity in our community,” Mondragón said. “You’re going to have all these veterans pay to let people know that they’re veterans. That’s the part that I just am in complete disagreement with — I think it should be free.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66515\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66515\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/","id":3864,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3863,3862,3861],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz","biography":"Not available","articles":[2355,2371,2376,2377,2406,2411,2412,2418,2420,2422,2427,2435,2450,2451,2459,2498,2505,2509,2556,2577,2605,2624,2691,2696,2713,2716,2717,2742,2771,2848,2858,2874,2907,2941,2951,3440,3458,3600,3602,3629,3742,3743,3747,3864,3904,3953,3956,4139,4421,4428,4447,4459,4480,4484,4490,4500,4507,4508,4509,4575,4587,4589,4598,4603,4618,4621,4627,4628,4632,4641,4646,4648,4651,4653,4661,4663,4675,4705,4745,4765,4773,4778,4815],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I am a Rock, I am an Island...

The deputy told him that he himself was “a proud graduate of SBCC” and then asked the subject to repeat his ABC’s.</p>\n<p>The man did not seem to know the alphabet but happily repeated, “I’m from SBCC. I am a proud graduate.”</p>\n<p>He then told officers he lived at “R690” on “I.V.

Thankfully, it remained unbroken.</p>\n<p>The man’s lucky streak ended there, though, as the officer picked up and dumped out the tequila.</p>\n<p>The subject explained to the officer, “It’s okay for me to be drunk. I’m over 21.”</p>\n<p>Despite his age, the man was breaking two laws – possession of an open container of alcohol and obvious public intoxication – so the officer arrested him.</p>\n<p>While at the IVFP station waiting for transfer to jail, the man alternated between lying on the floor and sitting in the chair, apparently trying to find the most comfortable position.</p>\n<p>Soon the man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>I Would Walk 500 Miles… But Not with Her<br>\nThursday, Oct. 11, 12:40 a.m. – Officers standing on Camino del Sur observed a woman staggering northbound down the road, stumbling and walking into parked vehicles.</p>\n<p>An officer attempted to contact the 20-year-old woman, but she turned and ran away, but only for a brief moment. The fleeing fugitive managed to get less than half a block before the deputy detained her and placed her on the curb.</p>\n<p>During an intoxicating interrogation, the woman said she did not know where she lived and slurred out several incorrect addresses as she tried to identify her current location.</p>\n<p>While the woman said she had “nothing” to drink, she was uncooperative and combatant, and the deputy had to place her face down and cuff her.</p>\n<p>During the arrest, an unknown man, who was apparently a victim of the directionally challenged woman, thanked the officer for taking the loaded lady off his hands, saying, “We’ve been walking in circles for hours.”</p>\n<p>At the Isla Vista Foot Patrol station, an officer had to remove chairs from the booking room to keep her from climbing and stumbling over them.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Tourist Trap<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 13, 3:21 p.m. – A 20-year-old man was staggering around the 6500 block of DP, looking for Freebirds, when a deputy contacted him.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the man where he was going, to which the man replied, “I’m from San Diego, I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>He then appeared as if he were about to topple over, so the deputy grabbed his arm to keep him on his feet.</p>\n<p>The man then told the officer that he had no friends in “I.P.” and had had eight beers that afternoon.</p>\n<p>For the man’s safety, he was arrested for public intoxication.
