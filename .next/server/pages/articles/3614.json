UCSA meets monthly, and in its October meeting discussed the goals of the Student Advocacy, Governance, and Engagement (S.A.G.E.) fee, Million Student March, developing the role of Student Advocate to the Regents (StARs) and communications with the UC Office of the President.</p>\n<p>S.A.G.E. is a proposal that would establish a UC-wide, voluntary opt-out fee of six dollars per student to fund UCSA and is set to be established at the upcoming November Regents meeting. The Million Student March is a movement that demands tuition-free public college, cancellation of all student debt and a minimum $15 wage for all campus workers which will take place at campuses across the nation Nov. 12. StARs are UC students who attend Board of Regents meetings held every other month to converse with regents and to present student concerns, and UCSA hopes to increase the presence and influence of StARs at the meetings.</p>\n<p>UCSA President and fourth-year peace and conflict studies major at UC Berkeley Kevin Sabo said UCSA is funded by student associations across the UC campuses, and for individual UC’s to receive the benefits of UCSA at the state level the associations must pay their membership dues. According to Sabo, the SAGE fee would better connect students and decision makers.</p>\n<p>“Really what S.A.G.E. does is there is a lot of difficulties with students being able to get access to decision makers,” Sabo said. “With S.A.G.E., the UCSA would be able to really eliminate that barrier of accessibility and get students before those decision makers.”</p>\n<p>Sabo said students who are interested in going to Sacramento to lobby may have troubles paying for transportation and other expenses. According to Sabo, S.A.G.E. will allow UCSA to “spend more effectively.”</p>\n<p>“They have to front the cost to participate and then wait several weeks, even months, to get reimbursed,” Sabo said. “S.A.G.E. is really about stabilizing the organization, giving a better, more predictable outlook on what revenues are going to be like so we can budget for things like taking students to lobby on things like student loan debt or the Perkins Loans.”</p>\n<p>UCSA campus action vice chair and UCSB fourth-year global studies major Dana Patterson said the Million Student March is a “unique opportunity” to address the growing problem of student debt in the United States. According to Patterson, tuition freezes are not enough.</p>\n<p>“Every person in our community is affected by student debt,” Patterson said. “Student debt is greater than credit card debt … It has tripled in the last 10 years … education needs to be free, mainstream, and make politicians talk about it.”</p>\n<p>According to Patterson, the board meeting was “100 percent a success,” and UCSA passed a resolution for the UCs to contribute to the efforts of the Million Student March on individual campuses. Patterson said she encourages students across the nation to participate in the Million Student March at their campus.</p>\n<p>“This is for every student to get involved, and I encourage any who wants to join this movement to come,” Patterson said.</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley graduate student Iman Sylvain said StARs are allowed to provide comments at UC Regents Board meetings and meet with Regents in private settings such as in break rooms or while getting lunch.</p>\n<p>“We have a wonderful program that gives students a back door access to the ability to really interface genuinely with the Regents, because they are kind of an elusive group,” Sylvain said.</p>\n<p>Sylvain said StARs representatives are able to advocate for issues relevant to UC students.</p>\n<p>“We’ve talked about student homelessness, we’ve talked about renewing the act for sexual assault prevention training for faculties, we also talked about mental health and the cost of living has been huge,” Sylvain said.</p>\n<p>According to Sylvain, UCSA is working on developing more personal relationships with Regents through StARs in order for the Regents to better understand the student perspective.</p>\n<p>“For example, the housing crisis — you can see that, you can see students sleeping in their cars or showering at the gym,” Sylvain said. “The Regents are very removed from the on-campus situation … So we are trying to engage [the Regents] in different ways.”</p>\n<p>According to Sylvain, UCSA is “only” scheduled to meet with the UC Office of the President three hours a year.</p>\n<p>“We are definitely pushing for the president to take more meetings and to have more ongoing conversations with them,” Sylvain said. “What are the ways to be in constant communication with the Office of the President?”</p>\n<p>Sylvain said UCSA advocates for a “genuine” shared government between administration, faculty and students.</p>\n<p>“Why don’t we have a vote — why don’t we have a say when it comes to decision making?” Sylvain said. “We want more than just our ‘foot in the door;’ we want a seat at the table.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The public forum ended with police threatening protesters with arrest.</p>\n<p>Security personnel checked students before they were permitted to enter the public forum. The search included wanding students with hand-held metal detectors and forcing them to leave food and drinks outside the forum.</p>\n<p>The forum began at approximately 8 a.m. with 38 people signed up to speak. Individuals were permitted to speak for one minute, while groups of two or more who chose to combine their time received two-and-a-half minutes to speak.</p>\n<p>Several students spoke about divesting from fossil fuels, with one student expressing outrage that UC administration claimed it would be too difficult to divest.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think climate change is complicated when we’re talking about a simple divestment,” said a student from UC Santa Cruz Fossil Free. “I think that when you have a top team of investors you can find out how you can divest over seven years and make a public politicized statement, because that is what we are asking you to do.”</p>\n<p>There were also speakers who were angered by the tuition increases in the wake of the audit.</p>\n<p>“We have to question why tuition increases are disproportionate to state disinvestment,” Taylor Chanes, the Associated Students external vice president at UC Irvine, said. “I don’t understand why we have a proposed increase in 2014 and another one in 2017 when we have millions of dollars in a reserve, whether or not that is supposed to go towards funding different programs for students that you are already under-resourcing.”</p>\n<p>The Regents will discuss the audit more thoroughly on Thursday.</p>\n<p>There were also several comments regarding UC President Janet Napolitano’s salary, including one graduate student who referenced the low wages made by teaching assistants.</p>\n<p>There were also calls for Napolitano’s resignation.</p>\n<p>“I think you need to resign, first of all,” one man said, prompting applause at the meeting. “I also think there needs to be a criminal investigation.”<br>\nSeveral speakers went over their allotted time and were asked to stop.</p>\n<p>After public comment, while Regent Chair Lozano was thanking those that spoke, one audience member stood up and began to chant, “Whose university?”<br>\nOther audience members immediately caught on and started chanting back “Our university.”</p>\n<p>As the chants grew, the room became more hectic. A reporter from UC Santa Cruz jumped over the barrier separating the crowd from the Regents in an attempt to get a photo. He was reprimanded by police.</p>\n<p>Despite Regent Chair Lozano’s attempts to speak, she was drowned out by the protesters. A police officer then stood in front of the crowd reading the rules of conduct, before telling the protesters that the police would begin arresting participants if they did not leave in five minutes.</p>\n<p>The Regents left the room at this time.</p>\n<p>“As far as Regents meetings go, unfortunately, it seems standard that you know, the meeting is shut down and the Regents leave and don’t really pay attention to us,” Michael Kile, who organized the protest with Gabriela Romo, said.</p>\n<p>“The way that Regents set up their meetings they set them up to minimize the public’s kind of view of that” Romo said. “The fact that they shut down the meeting shows that they’re clearly scared that people are out there and pushing for you know maybe the right side of history.”</p>\n<p>The chanting continued for two more minutes while the police counted down the minutes. Protesters filed out while chanting and all had left the room by the five-minute mark.</p>\n<p>Police did not make any arrests.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

government without coming to a resolution for the children of undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump formally ended DACA on Sept. 5, 2017 and expects to fully end the program by March 5.</p>\n<p>It is uncertain where DACA will leave its 800,000 recipients at a federal level, but California legislators and the University of California (UC) have stated they will continue to provide support for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“If there’s a federal restriction, then there will be a restriction for federal resources for undocumented students in accessing them; however, for most resources they don’t need DACA to access, for example, The California Dream Act,” said Diana Valdivia, coordinator of Dream Scholars/Undocumented Students Services at UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Valdivia said the California Dream Act, which allows undocumented individuals who have AB 540 status to apply for financial aid at the state and institutional level, will not be affected by DACA ending. Educational aid in California will not be affected regardless of DACA status.</p>\n<p>The UC Immigrant Legal Services Center will continue to provide legal services to undocumented students with or without DACA, according to Valdivia.</p>\n<p>In 2013, the UC Office of the President allocated $5 million across the 10 UC campuses for undocumented student support and later earmarked $8.4 million a year through the 2018-19 academic year to be divided among the UC’s DREAM Loan Program, Undocumented Legal Services and targeted undergraduate and graduate fellowships.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano also released a <a href=\"http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC-Community-DACA-FINAL.pdf\">statement</a> on Sept. 12, 2017, expressing support for undocumented students and prohibited UC campus police from contacting, detaining and arresting individuals based on suspected undocumented status.</p>\n<p>In September, Gov. Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">signed</a> Senate Bill 54, which declared California a sanctuary state, prohibiting local and state law enforcement agencies from collaborating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal received local <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/no-daca-no-deal-dont-take-your-students-for-granted/\">backlash</a> on his decision to vote for H.R. 195, since the government shutdown was later seen as a Democratic tactic to demand legal protection for undocumented students. His campaign platform was largely based on supporting undocumented students.</p>\n<p>At an open forum, Carbajal representative Elijah Ettenger said that Carbajal voted for H.R. 195 to maintain private assistance for mudslide victims in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>According to a Congressional Affairs Advisory document, certain requests for individual disaster assistance will no longer be possible during a government shutdown. These include requests for case management and crisis counseling, which would require review or approval from a furloughed employee.</p>\n<p>Trump has expressed openness to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/24/white-house-promises-new-immigration-framework-amid-stalled-negotiations-on-dreamers/?utm_term=.de1df0750fa9\">deal</a> that would create a path to citizenship for DACA recipients in exchange for funding of his promised wall at the border of the United States and Mexico. Valdivia did not offer an opinion on the possibility.</p>\n<p>“If you were to ask me and then you ask someone else, then their notion would be different,” she said. “It would be a political guess.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

and organizations across the UC to add a Student Regent Adviser position as part of his Shared Governance Initiative.</p>\n<p>Oved’s initiative aims to increase student representation on the UC Board of Regents through an appointed position, which would belong to a student from a different level of education than the elected student regent. Currently, Oved, an undergraduate student at UCLA, holds the only voting Student Regent position for the 2015-2016 term. UC Riverside graduate student Marcela Ramirez serves as the Student Regent-designate, a non-voting position, and will be the 2016-2017 Student Regent. If Oved successfully establishes the adviser position, he hopes to ultimately secure a new Student Regent voting position on the Board of Regents.</p>\n<p>According to Oved, UC students suffer a “lack of representation” on the Board of Regents, and he hopes to combat this underrepresentation with the new student position.</p>\n<p>“We’re 246,000 students with two seats and only one vote,” Oved said. “It’s ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>According to External Vice-President for Statewide Affairs, University of California Student Association (UCSA) Undergraduate Committee Chair and fourth-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza, the Regents fail to represent UC students with their decisions.</p>\n<p>“The UC Regents govern the University and unfortunately seem to be very out of touch with the issues facing students when making decisions that affect their lives,” Mirza said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Oved, past student Regents have pushed for another voting student board member and have not been successful. Oved said by first creating the adviser position, the Initiative will provide a foundation for the later establishment of a voting position.</p>\n<p>“It was really important for me to lay a framework and groundwork so we can really carry on the momentum that’s built every single year,” Oved said. “That’s why we crafted the Shared Governance Initiative, which is a multi-prong approach to increasing shared governance at the UC.”</p>\n<p>Last year, Oved served as the Student Regent-designate with Student Regent Sadia Saifuddin, a UC Berkeley undergraduate at the time. Oved said having two undergraduates representing all UC students was problematic when trying to address challenges unique to graduate and professional students.</p>\n<p>“As much as we studied about the issues of graduate students and professional students across the board, we still couldn’t really speak to the experience of a graduate student or a professional student, especially since they vary greatly from discipline to discipline,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>Oved said student governments on individual UC campuses change every year, and one goal of the initiative is to create a long-term plan that will keep momentum going for a new Student Regent position.</p>\n<p>“What we’re looking to do is try to defeat the leadership turnover and [ensure] that we have a long term plan that will make us effective at accomplishing,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Graduate Student Association External Vice President and UCSA Board Vice-Chair Yanira Rivas Pineda, the Regents often do not address issues pertaining to graduate students, a problem Oved’s Initiative could remedy.</p>\n<p>“Two years ago I remember talking with Avi about how important it is to have graduate students’ voices represented because our needs oftentimes go unheard,” Pineda said in an email. “Having two student Regents will ensure that we have more student representation and hopefully have an undergraduate and graduate representative.”</p>\n<p>According to Oved, tuition and financial aid policy discussions among the Board of Regents are often focused on undergraduates, but graduate and professional students face fee increases as well.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have as robust of a financial aid policy for our professional students as we do for undergrad students,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>According to Pineda, the most recent UC budget deal raises Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition for many professional students.</p>\n<p>“Many of us are no longer have access to traditional financial aid packages, like Cal grants, Federal grants, and subsidized student loans,” Pineda said in an email. “Many of us have families that we need to provide for as well and those of us who took out private student loans as undergrads are actually paying student loans while we’re in schools.”</p>\n<p>Oved said adding a new student adviser position will create change regarding problems that graduates and undergraduates both face, such as diversity, food security and tuition.</p>\n<p>“The Student Regent position has the access to key admin., to the Regents, to critical information and data that is otherwise not open to the general public,” Oved said. “They have ability to sustain long-term relationships and navigate the bureaucracy of the UC to really contribute meaningful change.”</p>\n<p>According to Pineda, graduate and professional students need UC-level representation to address challenges pertaining to issues such as mental health and financial stability.</p>\n<p>“A recent well-being report from UC Berkeley revealed that 47% of its PhDs and 37% of Master’s/Professional students score as depressed, so we know that mental health is an issue as well, on top of more specific graduate needs like student-advisor relationships, massive student loans and job security when we finish our program,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Oved, the UC Council of Presidents, both graduate and undergraduate, UCSA and Student Regent-designate Marcela Ramirez support the Initiative.</p>\n<p>“We’re starting to see a domino effect because now individual associations are passing resolutions in support of this item,” Oved said.</p>\n<p>Despite support from student organizations, Oved said he has faced opposition from the Board of Regents.</p>\n<p>“We are opposed because we have a fundamental disagreement about having more students at the table,” Oved said. “Some people use the excuse of not having enough space on the board. Some people say they don’t want to dilute the voting student Regent. Some people just disagree with the effect it will have on the board.”</p>\n<p>Despite opposition, Oved said he will keep working to implement the Initiative.</p>\n<p>“It’s my job now, with the collective effort of the students, to inform [the Regents] that this is no longer a question of whether we should do it or not,” Oved said. “It’s when we should do it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65298\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65298\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/regents-avi-oved-puts-forth-initiative-to-increase-student-representation-on-uc-board-of-regents/","id":3613,"author":{"id":251,"name":"Naomi Stolpner"},"related":[3612,3611,3610],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
