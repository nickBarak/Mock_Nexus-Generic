Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss Senator Dustin Larrazolo’s possible resignation, funding for the Anscombe Society’s debate on marriage and recent protests against the California Border Patrol’s (CBP) Career Fair presence.</p>\n<p>Larrazolo, a CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major, gave a speech in public forum citing reasons for his possible resignation at the end of the Winter 2016 Quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Larrazolo, he began to consider resignation after fellow senate members allegedly met with Hispanic and queer communities with which he was working, without Larrazolo’s knowledge, to work against his plan to host a public open caucus. The caucus, which Larrazolo planned to host at his house, would have been an opportunity for students to discuss concerns and ideas going into the upcoming spring elections and the potential founding of a new political party.</p>\n<p>“Tonight I am pouring out my heart because I ran for office with promise that I would have voices be heard or I’d die trying,” Larrazolo said. “Seeing those whom I’ve trusted in this process meet in secret to end open caucus spaces that I was going to host at my own home has pushed me to the brink.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said he was hospitalized for mental health reasons after becoming excluded from the Hispanic and queer communities with which he identified.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been going through a lot lately,” Larrazolo said. “To lose the safe spaces I have built here on campus, that’s all I had left.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said many senators do not follow the values of the identities of which they claim to have.</p>\n<p>“It is disgraceful that some of you label yourselves as allies and progressives. OPP [Open People’s Party] is not the only problem, so stop using it to protect your work as well,” Larrazolo said. “I only wanted to represent queers, Latinos and CCS students.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said A.S. political parties create the illusion of unity under shared values, which according to Larrazolo is not an accurate representation of OPP.</p>\n<p>“I was put into some kind of battle that I thought I had to fight and I want to apologize to those of you who have been afflicted by this whole predicament of political parties,” Larrazolo said. “We have aligned ourselves with things that do not exist. I am sorry to all of you, and with this I am announcing possibly my intent of resignation.”</p>\n<p>Senate also discussed the Anscombe Society’s plan to host a debate between scholars for and against “nontraditional marriage,” and its role, or lack thereof, in funding the event. The Anscombe Society, which advocates for traditional marriage as the only valid definition of marriage, requested funding from A.S. Finance and Business Committee (A.S. F&amp;B), an A.S. Senate entity, for a debate between Dr. Ryan T. Anderson and UCSB philosophy professor Dr. Quentin Gee.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B originally chose not to fund the event, and the Anscombe Society spoke to Senate to challenge the decision.</p>\n<p>Carlos Flores, Anscombe Society president and fourth-year philosophy major, said the A.S. F&amp;B rational to not fund the debates based on the capabilities of the participants was not justified.</p>\n<p>“Whether you think that Dr. Gee is a capable opponent or whether this event is balanced should be irrelevant in your decision on whether to provided funding,” Flores said. “If balance were a criteria for providing funds, no leftist speaker would be funded on this campus.”</p>\n<p>Flores said the event is an academic event that promotes political and philosophical discussion.</p>\n<p>“It contributes to the mission of this institution as an institution of learning,” Flores said. “It is also balanced to the extent that this is a debate and Dr. Gee, I assure you, is a good debate opponent.”</p>\n<p>Flores said funding from A.S. is “crucial” if the event is to occur.</p>\n<p>“As it stands, we do not have sufficient funds for Anderson’s honorarium expenses and room rental costs and CSO’s, etc.,” Flores said.</p>\n<p>Senate voted to review A.S. F&amp;B minutes and fully funded the event in a 20-0-1 vote.</p>\n<p>Senate also discussed the protests that broke out against CBP at the recent Career Fair, which some students found upsetting.</p>\n<p>Michael Torbati, off-campus senator and third-year economics and accounting major, said the protest was not what he expected it to be and that peers have told him they believe it negatively impacted the school.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that it didn’t really get carried out the way I thought it would, what we were told would happen in Senate,” Torbati said. “Entering the actual Career Fair was probably not the best decision, I was told from people who were there. They told me that it didn’t really do well for our reputation [to employers].”</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Fung, off-campus senator and third-year economics and accounting major, said the protest made students nervous to talk to the employers, which he feels defeats the purpose of a career fair.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t fair to the students. I’m not saying anything against the protest itself, but the way it was carried out,” Fung said. “I felt embarrassed when I was walking around the area saying ‘I stood behind that,’ because when I was there, from what I saw and what I heard, I couldn’t stand behind that.”</p>\n<p>Akshaya Natarajan, off-campus senator and second-year political science major, said she understands the concerns of the students attending the Career Fair, but A.S. does not understand what undocumented students go through.</p>\n<p>“These are very valid concerns, and I completely understand that this is definitely a shame that students felt uncomfortable and perhaps personally attacked, but we also have to keep in mind that most of us sitting at this table are not in the shoes of these people,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, “A Resolution Directing the Executive Director to support The Green Initiative Fund Grant Application for BigBelly Solar Compost, Recycling, and Landfill Bins at the Pardall Center” was sent to immediate consideration, where it was passed unanimously.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67945\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/a-s-senate-meets-discusses-potential-fifth-resignation-from-senate-since-last-spring/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67945\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/a-s-senate-meets-discusses-potential-fifth-resignation-from-senate-since-last-spring/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/a-s-senate-meets-discusses-potential-fifth-resignation-from-senate-since-last-spring/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/a-s-senate-meets-discusses-potential-fifth-resignation-from-senate-since-last-spring/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/a-s-senate-meets-discusses-potential-fifth-resignation-from-senate-since-last-spring/","id":3977,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[3976,3975,3974],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez","biography":"Not available","articles":[2516,2571,2611,2670,2679,2694,3939,3962,3971,3974,3975,3976,3977],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Senate held their weekly meeting Wednesday night in the Flying A Room of the UCen to vote on a bill proposing a single transferable vote, a resolution to endorse UC Student Regent Avi Oved’s Student Advisor Proposal and whether to support the development of a Chican@ studies minor.</p>\n<p>In public forum, students voiced their opinions concerning the bill proposing single transferable voting and reforming election code to improve representation of minority groups on campus.</p>\n<p>Voter registration director and fourth-year political science major Jared Daniels spoke at the public forum and said 2,152 students, excluding online registration, registered in a nine-day campaign that included 57 volunteers.

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A room to discuss an unprecedented situation regarding the status of an off-campus senator who moved to an on-campus apartment.</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, off-campus senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major, reported to have moved from an off-campus apartment in Isla Vista into the “on-campus” Sierra Madre apartments. Under these circumstances, Melgoza does not represent her constituency because she is not living off-campus. A.S. Senate discussed whether Melgoza should resign and reapply to the other two open senate positions, if they should vote to make an exception to the bylaws or change the A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>Kimia Hashemian, A.S. internal vice president and fourth-year sociology major, said the legal code is “unclear” and does not provide guidelines on what do if a senator’s situation changes to one in which they do not represent their constituency.</p>\n<p>“It does say you have to remain in your constituency, but it never explains what to do in unforeseen circumstances where you have to move or what’s going to happen with the new undergraduate housing,” Hashemian said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she has been looking for alternative housing for the past three weeks, and the Sierra Madre apartments ended up being her “only” choice.</p>\n<p>“I asked the university for help. The only thing that they could offer me was Sierra Madre apartments,” Melgoza said. “I did discuss with administration, and I did discuss this with the Vice Chancellor, that I am an off-campus senator, that I was worried about what would happen with my position.”</p>\n<p>Hashemian said senate has the option to change the A.S. Legal Code to fit Melgoza’s situation or make a “one time exception” to have Melgoza keep her senate seat.</p>\n<p>“It’s up to you all to make that definition and you all can make the motion to allow Senator Melgoza be an off-campus senator, even though she’s living in Sierra Madre while you all make changes to bylaws,” Hashemian said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67717\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67717\" data-attachment-id=\"67717\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/senate-considers-situation-of-on-campus-senator-in-university-apartments-more/senate_by-lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67717\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67717\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>When the senate motioned to let the off-campus senator remain in Senate despite constituency issues, a hand vote of 10-3-8 stopped the motion from passing.</p>\n<p>Senate discussed Melgoza switching to one of the two vacant senate seats, an on-campus senator position and a letters and science senator, but was rejected since it would violate the elections code.</p>\n<p>Niki Elyasi, A.S. senator and second-year biopsychology major, said she will motion to table the approval in order for Melgoza to write a proposal describing how she will continue to serve her off-campus constituency while living on-campus.</p>\n<p>“I motion to table the approval for a week until we get a proposal from Senator Melgoza and then decide next week whether or not she should be sworn in or just switched I guess, or do nothing,” Elyasi said. “With the stipulation that Senator Melgoza will write a proposal on how she will represent off campus students while living in a university owned apartment.”</p>\n<p>The motion was passed in a unanimous decision.</p>\n<p>Alexander Bates, A.S. senator and second-year history major, was appointed to the Finance and Business committee.

Senate voted 13 to 8 on Wednesday to table a bill that would require student political parties to register as Office of Student Life (OSL) groups and abide by judicial procedures for claims of hazing or discrimination.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year economics and political science double-major Nawar Nemeh presented the bill, titled, “A Bill to Update Article XVII Section 5, 7, &amp; 8,” in response to alleged hazing of candidates within the Open People’s Party (OPP) and low student turnout for past elections. Under the bill, an OSL advisor would be assigned to each political party to monitor the group for any misconduct.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and second-year Asian-American studies and political science double-major Akshaya Natarajan said she supports the bill because of her prior experience campaigning with OPP.</p>\n<p>“As a senator that ran with OPP this past election cycle, I felt tokenized, and I felt whitewashed as a woman of color, flat out,” Natarajan said. “When I saw [my] picture, I literally laughed out loud. I was like what the fuck? I am three shades lighter than I actually am … and I was terrified.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year history of public policy and political science double-major Jerel Constantino said that political parties can be monitored internally rather than through OSL.</p>\n<p>“[A.S. staff members] are employed because they’re to not have conflicts of interest — it’s how they are employed,” Constantino said. “Their job is to be impartial and to work for the students. I have no concern of giving them authority.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik said he supports the bill, recalling a time he felt pressured by members of his party.</p>\n<p>“I had two papers due, I was on academic probation in my classes and I told one of the party leaders specifically … if I don’t finish these papers, I will be ineligible to run because I will get Fs in my classes,” Abdalmalik said. “Their response was, ‘you’re really letting everyone down; you have to fucking go or else.’”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik said requiring parties to register as OSL groups would not lead to OSL governing the A.S. program as a whole.</p>\n<p>“Parties … are not A.S, it’s that simple,” Abdalmalik said. “A party is a political faction that runs in order to get a place in A.S. This bill would not be regulating A.S as an organization, it would be regulating an unregulated, unchecked power that has the potential — and has in the past — to harm students in it.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year political science major Austin Hechler said an OSL advisor might be ineffective, suggesting that A.S. staff members regulate the parties because they are more familiar with the process and accessible to senators.</p>\n<p>“The fact that having parties join as an OSL group will make hazing stop, that is completely false,” Hechler said. “I feel like someone who’s in A.S. that you see on a daily basis . . . [members] would be more comfortable to report hazing to them because they are an accessible advisor than someone who is in OSL that comes around once a year.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza said groups form a hierarchy within A.S.</p>\n<p>“We’re being blind to the fact that O.P.P. runs year round. Let’s be honest; if you’re not in that little clique of OPP, if you’re not connected to A.S., you’re not going to know that you can run for an exec. position or senator because that option is not publicized everywhere,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and second-year undeclared major Natalie Jordan said that having political parties exist year-round would increase tension and further divide party lines within A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, I think it’s going to create more of a bubble than we already have,” Jordan said. “I think if we put a political party to our name year round, we get this tunnel vision of ‘oh I must align with my party’s ideals.’”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he proposed the bill to shed light on the culture of hazing within A.S., adding that members can treat each other in the “most toxic of ways” and very few victims feel comfortable coming forward.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of cases of students feeling victimized for their sexualities, feeling victimized about their work ethic, their relationships,” Nemeh said. “People don’t talk about how we treat each other and how we behave. I think it’s about damn time we do.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said even though A.S. voted to table the bill indefinitely, starting a conversation about hazing within A.S. is also important.</p>\n<p>“My bill intended to bring that to the forefront, and in that sense, I do think it was successful regardless of the fact that it was tabled indefinitely,” Nemeh said. “It opened up a conversation about something that no one has talked about before, which is student conduct within the association.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal declined comment until he can review Wednesday’s senate minutes.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65969\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65969\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/a-s-tables-bill-creating-party-oversight/","id":3976,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[3975,3974,3973],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
