Hell, For 20 Bucks I’ll Call Him a Chicken Fucker<br>\nSaturday, Nov. 4, 1:19 a.m. – Deputies walking down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed a 20-year-old man urinating off the balcony of someone else’s home.</p>\n<p>After finishing his business, the sloshed subject then attempted to enter the apartment, but was intercepted by a group of Foot Patrol officers.</p>\n<p>When they began questioning the man, he was unable to tell the deputies which street he lived on. He also could not explain why he was hosing down his neighbor’s deck with urine.</p>\n<p>Sensing the officers’ dissatisfaction with his answers, the man got pissed off. He started calling the deputies “mother fuckers” and began ranting incoherently about the movie Super Troopers.</p>\n<p>Taking a cue from the film, officers put the man in his place – jail – after arresting him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>I’m Freakin’ Out Man<br>\nSunday, November 5, 1:43 a.m. – An officer patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed an 18-year-old man leaning on a vehicle in a driveway.</p>\n<p>The man repeatedly yelled, “I love my parents.”</p>\n<p>The inebriated freshman – who was apparently a little more than homesick – could not maintain his balance without help, which led the deputy to conclude that the man was intoxicated.</p>\n<p>Some passers-by who had stopped to help the delinquent before the police arrived told officers they did not know the tanked teen, and could not take him home to Santa Rosa Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>To ensure the man’s safety, the officer arrested him for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Fighting and, Fighting and, Fighting and… Smoking the Reefer<br>\nFriday, Oct. 27, 12:48 a.m. – Officers patrolling the area were informed about a street fight happening at the intersection of Del Playa Drive and Camino Pescadero.</p>\n<p>When they arrived at the scene, the deputies found two women wrestling on the sidewalk, while a third woman was attempting to break up the brouhaha.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as the two slap each other and pull the other’s hair before they could end the scuffle.</p>\n<p>After checking the women for injuries, the deputies arrested the disorderly women for disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p>An officer began searching the subject’s belongings, and was searching the 20-year-old woman’s purse when he found a small amount of pot inside.</p>\n<p>When he showed the woman the illegal substance, the stoner bluntly said, “I wish I had some marijuana right now.”</p>\n<p>After hearing this, the officer arrested the woman for public intoxication, and dragged her into the patrol car – then, the subject’s smoldering temper got the best of her.</p>\n<p>As the fiending offender was transported to jail, she began to repeatedly kick the plexi-glass shield in the patrol car with her red high-heeled shoes, causing over $200 in damage.</p>\n<p>Officers booked the woman at the Santa Barbara County Jail, and she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>– Compiled by Nikki Moore</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

He also could not explain why he was hosing down his neighbor’s deck with urine.</p>\n<p>Then the man got pissed off. He began calling the deputies “motherfuckers” and started ranting incoherently about the movie “Super Troopers.”</p>\n<p>Taking a cue from the film, officers put the man in his place – jail – after arresting him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>Sunday, Nov. 5, 1:43 a.m. – An officer patrolling the 6600 block of DP observed an 18-year-old man leaning on a vehicle in a driveway.</p>\n<p>The man was loudly announcing, “I love my parents.”</p>\n<p>The inebriated freshman – who was apparently a little more than homesick – could not maintain his balance without help, which led the deputy to conclude that the man was intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The subjects accompanying the delinquent told officers they did not know the tanked teen, and could not take him home to the Santa Rosa Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>For the man’s safety, the officer arrested him for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Friday, Oct. 27, 12:48 a.m. – Officers were alerted to a fight while standing at the intersection of DP and Camino Pescadero.</p>\n<p>The deputies found two women wrestling on the sidewalk, as a third woman attempted to break up the brouhaha.</p>\n<p>The officers watched as the two pulled the other’s hair and slap at each other before ending the scuffle.</p>\n<p>After checking the women for injuries, the deputies arrested the disorderly women for disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p>An officer began searching the subjects’ belongings, and was going through the 20-year-old woman’s purse when he found pot inside.</p>\n<p>When he showed the woman the illegal substance, the stoner bluntly said, “I wish I had some marijuana right now.”</p>\n<p>After hearing this, the officer arrested the woman for public intoxication, and dragged her into the patrol car where the subject’s smoldering temper got the best of her.</p>\n<p>As the fiending offender was transported to jail, she repeatedly kicked the plexiglass shield in the patrol car with her red, heeled shoes, causing over $200 in damage.</p>\n<p>The woman was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail, and housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-12508\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-09/police-blotter-61/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-12508\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-09/police-blotter-61/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-09/police-blotter-61/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-09/police-blotter-61/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2006-11-09/police-blotter-61/","id":3879,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3878,3877,3876],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
