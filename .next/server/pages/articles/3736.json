style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident occurred at approximately 9 p.m. on the 800 block of Camino Del Sur, according to Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover.</span></p>\n<p>Sheriff’s deputies and UC Santa Barbara police officers responded to the scene after the Santa Barbara County Public Safety Dispatch Center received a report of “several male subjects fighting and two that were in need of medical help,” Hoover said in a release.</p>\n<p>When law enforcement arrived, they found an 18-year-old male and a 14-year-old male “lying on the sidewalk with multiple stab wounds,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>The two victims were transported to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital. Shortly after, deputies learned that a 17-year-old male from Goleta with stab wounds had been driven to the hospital by friends and was receiving medical care.</p>\n<p>The victims are recovering from their injuries. Their current conditions are unknown, Hoover said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident is currently under investigation. Sheriff’s deputies have secured the crime scene and are investigating the circumstances leading up to the incident to determine and locate the suspect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unknown at this time how many attackers were involved.</span></p>\n<p>Anyone with information about this incident can call the Sheriff’s Criminal Investigations Division at 805-681-4150.
