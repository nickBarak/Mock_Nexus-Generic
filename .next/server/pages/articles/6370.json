Will I relive freshman year, when a downpour melted the “costumes” off of a group of Isla Vista women, and my friend and I were given the unforgettable image of a pack of women running while holding their exposed breasts? Will I again encounter the guy in assless chaps strutting his situation all over DP? Or will I be treated to police on horseback confiscating a dominatrix’s horsewhip because it poses a clear and present danger to her submissive counterpart?</p>\n<p>One would hope. But what makes Halloween like this? Why do the masses flood to I.V. to dress as sluts and superheroes and superhero sluts? Well, the answer is simple: It will get you laid.</p>\n<p>In this article, in lieu of examining the seduction strategies of women as I had planned, I wish to examine the seduction strategies of Halloween. I feel this is a decent replacement, as it happens to overlap a great deal with the typical strategies used by women in I.V.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So let’s get started. Square one is the most natural of the costume choices: the “really, you might as well be naked, who are you kidding?” costume. This costume may also be known as the Nurse, the Firefighter, the Bumblebee or the “Duh … I’m a rabbit!” It involves wearing virtually nothing. Now, the tactic is very simple: Show a lot of skin. I am a personal fan of this tactic, as it is beautifully simple and also beautifully motivational. For example, I have been convinced to be a Home Depot-themed male stripper on one of the nights this weekend. I partially agreed to this because I have been slacking in the exercise department lately, and the idea of having to walk around in nothing but boxers, a tool belt and some tastefully placed washers is truly an impetus to undo the damages these first few weeks of school have inflicted on my exercise routine. So the “who are you kidding” costume has the benefit of being a motivational tool, as well as a fun way to parade yourself without shame. If you’ve never tried a “who are you kidding” costume, I wholeheartedly recommend it.</p>\n<p>Next, we will examine the suave costume. This costume involves being a badass, and usually involves wearing something conservative but slimming. For women, this can be stiletto heels, a whip and skintight leather. For men, more often than not, it’s a superhero costume. My default suave guise is a Batman suit. On top of being well-known, this choice agrees nicely with the fact over half of my wardrobe is black. Now, in the same way I respect the stripper outfits for being physically motivating, the suave costume tests intelligence and creativity. Since you cannot simply show skin and be done in this costume, you must rely on equal parts wit and sexiness. It’s the classy seduction — the woman in the sexy, floor-length dress or the man in the full-body business suit. It takes raw charisma, but if you make it work, you will be getting phone numbers left and right.</p>\n<p>The third costume is the cuddly, innocuous one. This costume is what the slut costume would be if you actually dressed as a bunny, bumblebee or Charlie Brown (and yes, that implies that I have seen a slutty Charlie Brown). It is fuzzy, conservative and at first glance completely unisexual. Then you’re suddenly 10 drinks deep and that bunny costume starts to look pretty soft, and the next morning you have to reconsider thinking furries are just weird fetishists. Now, some of the people wrapped from head to toe are actually quite devious. They use that Minnie Mouse costume to catch you off guard, and a moment later they are clumsily fumbling at you with their cartoon hands. I speak from personal experience. Not from a Halloween party, but at a ‘toon theme costume party where I found myself pinned to the wall by a particularly horny Roger Rabbit. It was terrifying. Beware the Care Bear whose gaze fixes on you the moment you walk into the room, for soon you will learn why they wanted you to call them “Love-a-Lot” bear.</p>\n<p>And finally, we have the “wtf?” costume. A favorite of hipsters, the sole purpose of this costume appears to be that you have to ask what it is. It may be a sign hanging around someone’s neck. It may be a single,</p>\n<p>strangely shaped protrusion from their chest. Or it might be a weird symbol tattooed on their face. Either way, I have to respect the simplicity involved with the wtf? strategy. Especially if it is accompanied by a good pickup line:</p>\n<p>“Hey, my friend and I were just wondering, what are you?”</p>\n<p>“I’m whatever you want me to be, baby.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps this approach lacks creativity, but it nonetheless has potential for sex appeal. I’m one to judge anyways, as lack of creativity is precisely why I will be dressing up as a Home Depot stripper this Halloween. Tips in the tool belt, please.</p>\n<p><em>Anonymous does not condone violating pumpkins.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/short-naked-halloween-costumes-work-assets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/short-naked-halloween-costumes-work-assets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/short-naked-halloween-costumes-work-assets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/short-naked-halloween-costumes-work-assets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/short-naked-halloween-costumes-work-assets/","id":6370,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6369,6368,6367],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous","biography":"Not available","articles":[5636,5840,5880,5886,5910,5981,6007,6071,6077,6094,6310,6369,6370,6375,6395,6397,6398,6399,6402,6403,7689],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"On Finding True Bromance At Last","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This week I want to pay small homage to my roommates, friends and a mildly interesting case study that examines why being authentic and overcoming stereotypes often go hand in hand.

Television and movies had taught me that this type of individual was to be avoided on the basis of also avoiding bullying and homophobia. As a young gay kid in the closet invariably would be, I was terrified that I wouldn’t get along with the prototypical hyper-masculine bro-types that sometimes seem to make this school their mecca. Fast forward two years to my current living situation, and I can say that cohabitating with a group of five of them has taught me a thing or two about how to bring my own special brand of sexual enlightenment to a group of otherwise heteronormatively inclined dudes who may never have given a passing thought to the fluidity of sexuality, the importance of male love in ancient Rome or any other inane ideas I throw at them. This social experiment of sorts I’ve been silently conducting has culminated not only in the formation of a tight-knit and tolerant group, but also a more sexually aware and, dare I say, politically-savvy group of friends who care deeply for one another. I like to think that I’m at least 75 percent responsible for this result but, admittedly, I made that number up.</p>\n<p>What’s that, you ask? What’s the secret to my seeming success in eradicating sexual and social stereotypes? Why, I’m glad you asked, dear reader. My secret — and here’s where it gets really complicated — was that I treated them all like I would treat any other group of friends: like people I want to get to know. Confused?

And in that time, we debated issues of sex, sexuality, gender, politics and culture, you name it. We held parties and watched movies together; we went on hiking trips and to fancy restaurants. I even gave them an informational session on how gay sex works. I got to know these guys, and they got to know me. So I guess that’s the simple secret to our friendship. Shocking isn’t it?</p>\n<p>So over the course of this admittedly boring and rather mundane anecdote, we come to the fairly obvious conclusion that those popular social models and the stereotypes that society presents us with, are too often false. This group of men that I had secretly been afraid of has turned into a set of the best friends I have ever known. My fear surrounding their masculinity and whether that would be a barrier to our friendship was not grounded in reality but rather in a set of preconceived notions handed to me by (for lack of a better word) “society.” So the next time you find yourself considering new friends, whether it’s that frat bro in your section, the sorority girl in your CLAS class or the stoner down the hall, they all have their own story to tell, and I’m sure you might like to hear it.</p>\n<p><em>This message has been approved by the bros of Luc Gendrot.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared on page 8 of the Wednesday, February 27, 2013 print edition of the<em> Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50377\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/on-finding-true-bromance-at-last/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50377\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/on-finding-true-bromance-at-last/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/on-finding-true-bromance-at-last/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/on-finding-true-bromance-at-last/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-27/on-finding-true-bromance-at-last/","id":6367,"author":{"id":456,"name":"Luc Gendrot"},"related":[6366,6365,6364],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"K.Perry Got It Right: Kiss a Girl, You’ll (Probably) Like It","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"We’ve all been there: It’s a party, everyone’s hammered and the girls are getting extra flirty.

However, when two girls kiss, it often seems to evoke a delightful fascination.</p>\n<p>Allow me to illustrate the various points regarding the reasons I enjoy kissing girls:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Girls are soft, pretty and smell nice. It’s really hit or miss with you boys. Some of you are hippies and believe that means you never have to wash your hair. You’re wrong. You may still be pretty, but you probably don’t smell too nice, do you?</p>\n<p>I have never had a bad girl-kiss. Well, save for sophomore year when my friend jumped on me while blacked out and banged her teeth into mine. But most times, girls just know how to use the appropriate amount of tongue. Guys, on the other hand, either tongue appropriately or get way too liberal. Less is more, fellas. Seriously. It should be a tease, a light tracing, a “hello” from tongue to tongue, not an all-caps “OH HAY DERE.”</p>\n<p>Between girlfriends, there’s an innocent enjoyment to the kiss. There’s no threat, no tongue siege. It’s just kissing for the fun of it.</p>\n<p>So go on, ladies, get a little tipsy and goofy with your gal pals and exchange a peck or two. No one takes these things seriously; it’s a form of play. Don’t get so in-your-head about these things.</p>\n<p>It is important I specify that I personally don’t condone kissing as a show. If you want to kiss another girl and there happen to be people around, fuck it. But if you’re being that drunk girl who’s doing it with the hopes of making guys stare at you, it will likely work but also make you look immature.</p>\n<p>And don’t be that guy. You all know him: He’s the one who goes up to the two girls like, “Hey, shall I join you ladies?” Dude, you will be ignored. Just admire the beauty of the situation and remain silent. You are a man amidst nature, witnessing two unicorns going at it. Don’t disturb the majesty.</p>\n<p>Now, on top of all of this, there are, of course, social politics that go into making out with members of the same gender. To cite renowned sexologist Alfred Kinsey, one’s sexuality can be viewed as a point on a sexual gradient rather than confined to a certain category of sexuality. I think we can all appreciate and agree with this statement. Kinsey also found that, along this gradient, females are the more fluid of the two genders. They can be closer to the middle, at times. When girls get drunk and make out, it’s not necessarily because they identify as bisexual. I’ve made out with a fair number of my female friends. Often it’s something close friends do when they reach a certain level of shwasted. I wouldn’t make out with my roommate normally. But throw some booze in the situation, and suddenly there are three girls kissing at once.</p>\n<p>What’s fascinating to me is that despite partaking in a little tongue waggling, none of the girls I’ve kissed would identify as bisexual or lesbian. It’s purely for enjoyment. I would describe the atmosphere as one of playful innocence — naughty but fun. Now here is the odd thing to me: If two guys got hammered and started making out, the same social rules often would not apply. I am not saying this is fair. I am not saying this is something people unanimously agree upon. But if two guys were making out at a party, most would instantly assume they were bisexual or homosexual, right? If it was a joke, I could dig it. However, if it was carried out in the same fashion that my female friends and I do our kissing (i.e. enjoying one another and ignoring the populace) then I must admit, I would be turned off by both males. They would not be potential candidates for sending their deep v-diver into my ocean blue. Many girls I speak to agree (with the exception of the female friend whose eyes brightened as she cried out with delight, “Threesome!”).</p>\n<p>Now, things are certainly gearing toward that sort of behavior being more acceptable. I think that’s healthy and exciting. Norms are shifting! Huzzah! But at this point, there is still that frustrating tilt in male versus female social codes. If a girl invites multiple suitors into her boudoir, you assume that eventually it’ll be like throwing a hot dog into a hallway. But if a guy does the same, smoldering at da’ bitches before getting down, no worries, he’s just another playa’. These are the typical standards of our time. But still, in comparison to what our mums and dads faced, this is significant progress. Consider this: 30 years ago, you were a slut if you put out before five dates. I hear people moaning and groaning about having to wait for three.</p>\n<p>So my sweetlings, dabble in some smooching of the sisters and enjoy getting fresh with your lady bros. Experimentation is a healthy, integral part of the college experience. Eventually the realms of experimentation may continue to expand to be more inclusive. Party on, my gaping-gobbed Gauchos, and Happy Humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. is immune to the drunchies.

It is an unfortunate aspect that shapes our world in a biased manner and has created inequality since its unfortunate conception in the age of patriarchal religion. And so, I wish to turn my eye upon this in hopes of making others reflect at least briefly on the subject and perhaps work to undo some of the damage this — and there is no better word for it — assumption does.</p>\n<p>In sex, there is virtually always an active role and a passive role. Some sexual acts manage to get around this requirement — the one that comes to mind is a certain number (69) — but for the most part, one person is acting and the other receiving. In normal, coital sex, the active role is assumed to be the male and the passive role by the female. And thus in a single sentence I have managed to identify exactly what is problematic in our contemporary formulation of sexual power — that the passive role is passive, and the active role is active. In this terminology, power is inherently unbalanced, and it casts the woman in an immediately weaker light.</p>\n<p>Now, one might stop here to say that they do not view women as weaker. That is good for you, I’m happy for you, but when we speak in generalities about sexual power, few will dispute that men (the active role) are widely considered to come out on top (incidentally, for you gay people, feel free to generalize this conversation to tops and bottoms). In a certain base way the imbalance of power seems to follow as a logical conclusion. Simply speaking, the active role is who is making the sex happen. For, without the thrusting, there is no groaning. But if we take this definition of ‘the most power’ as being ‘who makes the sex happen,’ then the model breaks down immediately after one issue is examined …</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Consider oral sex.</p>\n<p>Why is it that in a psychological formulation of oral sex, if the male is receiving he appears dominant — he is somehow forcing the female to operate on him — and yet when the female is receiving the male still,</p>\n<p>subconsciously speaking, feels dominant — he is now just operating on her. So this idea that the one who is making sex happen is dominant is not strictly true. Our society seeks to hand the power to who has the penis or who is sticking their penis into someone else. Logically speaking, the giver of oral sex should be considered the active sexual participant. She/he is not only making the entire sexual event occur, but could quite easily demonstrate how much power he/she wields by biting down.</p>\n<p>That would rather quickly demonstrate who is really holding the cards.</p>\n<p>Thus, society clearly has not defined our power balance based on any logical consideration of who is making the sex happen. That argument is just a fallacy crafted to defend what is an essentially patriarchal power trip.</p>\n<p>So, why do we argue that the man (or top) is the dominant aspect in the sexual yin-yang? Does it have to do with actual physical strength? Perhaps it once did. Physical strength and dominance have been mingled with sex acts since quite literally the dawn of social animals.</p>\n<p>Examine lions, bulls or monkeys — he who sticks it in someone else is considered more powerful. But when humans introduced consciousness and law into the mix, this condition broke down. Rapists who dare use these base acts as a show of power go to prison, where they rapidly become the sexual recipient of a 300 pound man named Little Tinabell. In our civilized society, the power women wield as the passive sexual partner is so real that it was demonized by the Christians and made mystical by other religions. Women as witches, enchantresses and various magical beings all arise from this ability they (and by extension any attractive, passive sexual being) wield to compel their desirers into what is essentially slavery (marriage). And all because they are willing to take a penis into their body. This strikes me as quite a bit of power.</p>\n<p>So when we consider a world where law holds — where a rapist is punished severely and painfully — one cannot say that being able to stick it in someone makes you any more powerful or dominant. And yet we still do it. The idea that the passive role is somehow less dominant is so ingrained in our culture that it has become a natural assumption. Insults are framed around who is fucking who, power balances are assumed from sexual configurations and speculations are made about relationship dynamics from singular facts.</p>\n<p>Now, I will probably not stop saying ‘that midterm fucked me,’ in reference to a midterm that was particularly difficult. That form of insult is so ingrained into my lingual patterns that it honestly</p>\n<p>doesn’t even carry the psychological implications I’ve stated here — saying something has fucked me is just a way of saying it did me harm in some way.
