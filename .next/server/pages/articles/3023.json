Resolution Policy Aims to Protect Students From PTSD Triggers","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students Senate and Office of the Student Advocate General are working together to implement a guideline advising professors to alert students of class content that can potentially “t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Associated Students Senate and Office of the Student Advocate General are working together to implement a guideline advising professors to alert students of class content that can potentially “trigger” symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in those who have experienced traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse or fighting in war.</p>\n<p>The goal of the policy — enacted by an A.S. resolution passed last week — is to protect students with PTSD who may be harshly affected by content, such as video scenes, and it would allow these students to miss classes containing such material without losing course points. The proposal does not require that professors alter their planned course material, but that they include in their syllabi “trigger warnings” — a term for a warning label on content that might trigger a traumatic response. However, the resolution for the policy only directs A.S. collegiate senators to visit the deans at the three colleges of the university to request the new guideline; thus, the resolution has not resulted in any concrete changes to current university policy.</p>\n<p>As defined by the National Institute of Mental Health, PTSD develops after a “terrifying” incident involving physical harm or the threat of harm and it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents — rape, being kidnapped, child abuse, torture, car accidents, plane crashes, train wrecks, bombings or natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate Chief of Staff Bailey Loverin, a third-year student in the CCS Literature program, introduced the proposal last week at a Senate meeting and explained her personal experiences in classes as the reason behind the proposal.</p>\n<p>“There was absolutely no warning before class that [this material] would be covered,” Loverin said.</p>\n<p>Several A.S. Senators, including second-year student Nikki Calderon, immediately jumped on board with the proposal, stating that it will give students “the opportunity to be attentive in their classes and protect themselves.”</p>\n<p>“UCSB has lots of resources, but at the same time they can’t reach you when you’re sitting in a lecture, uncomfortably watching a film,” Calderon said. “If they do need to miss a lecture, they could tell the professor ahead of time and do an alternative assignment.”</p>\n<p>Calderon also said she thinks there might be a correlation between watching violent material and acting violently in real life, however she insisted that she did not believe in censoring that material.</p>\n<p>“T.V. is definitely a factor among children, but ultimately, it’s up to adults to make the right decisions,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Not everyone has responded positively to the Senate resolution, however. Second-year political science major Jason Garshfield said he was disappointed in the A.S. Senate for passing the resolution, as he said it may hinder the intellectual and emotional growth of some students and that it approaches censorship.</p>\n<p>“The learning process necessarily involves exposing people to ideas that will challenge their beliefs and make them feel uncomfortable,” Garshfield said. “People who attend college are implicitly agreeing to be pushed outside their intellectual and emotional comfort zones … I would like to see the Senate have a higher regard for the fortitude and resilience of the students of this university, as well as the discretion of our professors to teach their students at the level they feel is appropriate.”</p>\n<p>According to professor of English and comparative literature, and Dean of Humanities and Fine Arts, David Marshall, faculty currently tend to warn students if they think certain material might be disturbing. Marshall also said that while he believes faculty should be sensitive to the concerns of students, “thousands of years of art and literature have been provocative and disturbing,” and these works are important because they advance our understanding of social ills.</p>\n<p>“Think of ‘Oedipus Rex,’ which contains scenes of violence, patricide, incest, and death. In addition, there are many works of art, film, and literature that contain disturbing images in order to prevent social ills, such as violence against women,” Marshall said in an email. “Finally, I would note that our university adheres to the principles of academic freedom.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and third-year Asian American studies major Beatrice Contreras said she has an idea of how this resolution could be implemented on campus.</p>\n<p>“Ideally, some professors are already [having these warnings], and are putting in UCSB C.A.R.E. and C.A.P.S. numbers on their syllabi,” Contreras said. “The first step is bringing it to Academic Senate, and they can choose to make it a departmental choice to make it a requirement in that class to warn students.”</p>\n<p>Over time, Loverin aims to make trigger warnings on syllabi a UC-wide policy.</p>\n<p>“[A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs] Alex Choate will introduce this to the next UC government meeting … to make sure this is not just Santa Barbara, but across the nation.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54422\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-resolution-policy-aims-to-protect-students-from-ptsd-triggers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54422\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-resolution-policy-aims-to-protect-students-from-ptsd-triggers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-resolution-policy-aims-to-protect-students-from-ptsd-triggers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-resolution-policy-aims-to-protect-students-from-ptsd-triggers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-resolution-policy-aims-to-protect-students-from-ptsd-triggers/","id":3023,"author":{"id":186,"name":"Jessy Diamba"},"related":[3022,3021,3020],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":186,"name":"Jessy Diamba","biography":"Not available","articles":[3023,3053],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

After Lau, OPP’s Guthy and Democratic Process Party’s Kaur spent an hour discussing topics such as campus safety, university affordability, their plans for aiding underrepresented communities at UCSB and their past experience with A.S. and other organizations.</p>\n<p>Lau’s plans centered on increasing the visibility and transparency of the Associated Students Senate, keeping senators on track with their individual projects and creating new job opportunities for students across various majors in hopes of providing work experience for students facing a competitive job market after graduation.</p>\n<p>With regards to creating more job opportunities for students, Lau said she would work to build more A.S. entities similar to the A.S. Bike shop but tailored to different majors. As an example, Lau said her first priority would be founding an A.S. Computer Repair shop, where students with technical skills hoping to work with computers in the future could both gain experience and earn money.</p>\n<p>“In this economy … students who go to a four-year university are not able to get a job afterwards,” Lau said. “In the end, experience gets jobs. …What I want to do is really create more student services to create these jobs.”</p>\n<p>When asked what Associated Students means to her, Lau said she sees the association as a means of helping students complete projects and make changes they care about.</p>\n<p>“Associate Students is really empowering students,” Lau said. “It’s something that we use as a tool to complete things that mean something to us. …We are the future, we are students and Associated Students really gives us that avenue to feel like we can make a change on not only this campus … but also the world.”</p>\n<p>After Lau’s forum, Kaur and Guthy took to the stage in order to answer the audience’s questions in their vie for the presidential office. Kaur has previously worked in the A.S. Office of the President, as an A.S. Senator and as co-chair of Student Commission on Racial Equality, and she currently sits on the board of the United States Student Association. Guthy is currently A.S. Letters and Science collegiate Senator and previously worked as Santa Cruz Hall President and on Community Affairs Board.</p>\n<p>Both candidates named university affordability as their top priority, as they both said there is currently a lack of investment in higher education of the state. Both said they would work to organize lobbying efforts with state legislatures. Guthy added that she, like Lau, would work to create more job opportunities for students as a way of alleviating some of the cost, while Kaur said she would facilitate quarterly swap meets where students would be able to trade books and furniture.</p>\n<p>As during the other forums that happened this past week, Kaur and Guthy were asked about Deltopia and their thoughts on what happened and who was responsible, in addition to how to move forward and prevent similar occurrences. Guthy said although she could not attend due to a student lobby conference in Sacramento, she felt that a lack of communication between students and law enforcement was largely responsible for the riots.</p>\n<p>“That event shook me,” Guthy said. “I believe that the circumstances that led to the events of Deltopia primarily were miscommunications between students and law enforcement … One potential solution to this is the creation of a police advisory board.”</p>\n<p>Kaur agreed that miscommunication greatly contributed to the proceedings, and added that there should have been a town hall beforehand to better prepare the community. Kaur also said she was wary of encouraging an increase in police presence in Isla Vista as a reaction.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe that we should really even have more police. I think that police can make certain communities feel unsafe,” Kaur said. “I wouldn’t blame the police either for the events that happened, but I think we need more communication … I do believe that we should be policing the police, in fact.”</p>\n<p>One area in which the candidates did not agree involved UCSB’s membership status on the United States Student Association. According to Guthy, UCSB currently pays $10,000 per year to be a part of USSA, in addition to the $150,000 a year to be a part of University of California Student Association. A bill has recently been presented to the A.S. Senate that would withdraw from USSA on account of finances. Guthy said she felt strongly that USSA is an important organization and network for students across the nation, but she said UCSB would still be involved in USSA through its UCSA membership and did not think it was worth paying the additional $10,000 to USSA each year.</p>\n<p>“Membership in UCSA gives us membership in USSA … so withdrawing from USSA does not mean we are not members; it means we are no longer direct members,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Kaur, who sits on the Board of Directors at USSA and who has attended every USSA conference since her second year, said she believes the association has been the “most empowering organization” of her life. According to Kaur, while UCSB would still technically be involved through UCSA, it would no longer be able to send a delegation to the conference each year, and therefore she opposed withdrawing membership.</p>\n<p>“USSA is one of the most important organizations in this nation. Student power can move mountains,” Kaur said. “As a board member of USSA, I actually have to say that even though we would be members through UCSA, there would no longer be a UCSB delegation, and that is a shame.”</p>\n<p>When asked why each candidate chose their respective parties, Guthy said she chose OPP due to its track record of creating tangible change, citing the grants they pushed for and received for increased lighting in I.V., the expansion of campus wifi and a letter-writing campaign to legislatures lobbying to stop cuts to the state budget that drew over 11,000 letters.</p>\n<p>“I was particularly drawn to this party because we have a history of creating tangible change on this campus that directly benefits students. … As president, I want to continue that legacy,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Kaur also praised her party’s tangible accomplishments, notably the A.S. food bank, and the textbook marketplace and added that she chose DP because she saw a strong DP presence throughout the year across multiple important campus organizations.</p>\n<p>“We are the party you will see year-round, regardless of elections. … We are the students who have been there, [who] have been at the front lines of change since day one of their experience here,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>The last question posed to candidates before their closing statements prompted them to describe how they had worked to aid underrepresented communities at UCSB. Guthy said she acknowledged that she comes from a position of privilege, but that she has worked for underrepresented communities through Swipes for the Houseless and would continue to educate herself and reach out to those communities as president.</p>\n<p>“I don’t identify with a lot of communities who feel that they are underrepresented on this campus — I acknowledge this,” Guthy said. “I really want to work by collaborating with [and] working for a future that, we all as Gauchos … can all work towards. … As president I will continue my work and outreach.”</p>\n<p>Kaur listed the several organizations she has been involved with since coming to UCSB that work to serve minority students, and said she would continue doing everything within her power to fight for the underrepresented.</p>\n<p>“I, coming in, was struggling with my identity as an Indian woman,” Kaur said. “It really opened my eyes to how institutions in this country really oppress certain people and give privilege to others. … I continue to learn and educate myself. … I believe it begins with education.”</p>\n<p>Both candidates closed the forum by asserting their passion and drive for the UCSB community and Associated Students. Voting begins Monday at 8 a.m. on GOLD, and the results will be announced the following Thursday at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Photo by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54906\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54906\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/","id":3020,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3019,3018,3017],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Its architect, Jeff Shelton, came during Public Forum to discuss the proposed plans with senators and shed light on the development process.</p>\n<p>Shelton approached senators in order to explain the development process for the Nest, which has already garnered student criticism. He also sought to relay his desires as an architect to create a space that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional for I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>According to Shelton, the building has been in the works for a significant amount of time and is part of the Isla Vista Master Plan, a project designed to complement the Countywide Comprehensive Plan and Goleta Community Plan and meant to address improvements to housing, transportation, infrastructure and other aspects within the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“The planning department wants it denser in Isla Vista,” Shelton said. “They want to get more housing — more variety of housing — and the Master Plan shows this area being built up … It happens to be at probably the best corner of town here.”</p>\n<p>Shelton said the Nest will provide affordable single unit housing, rentable hotel space and commercial space in a way that fits with the existing community while also living up to environmentally-friendly ideals. Furthermore, Shelton said he sees this task as part of his duty to the community to keep the space lively and exciting.</p>\n<p>“My goal as an architect is to try to make it work in the community,” Shelton said. “Now, the community is not all built up yet, so you kind of have to look ahead to make it work … I’ve got to keep it livable and interesting for the community at that street.”</p>\n<p>Senators expressed concern about the way the proposed development would affect property values and local businesses. However, Shelton was unable to fully respond to these concerns since his involvement lies solely within the architectural designing aspect of the building development.</p>\n<p>Following Shelton, Public Relations Specialist for UCPD Ariel Bournes came to update Senators on the steps the police department are currently undertaking in order to address both the sexual assault and general safety concerns in Isla Vista. Bournes cited increased video surveillance, increased staffing and patrolling, increased presence of Community Service Officers and continuing conversations with Chancellor Henry T. Yang about how to best protect UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“It’s an all hands on deck situation at the police department,” Bournes said.</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) Co-Chair Kaitlyn Christianson expressed her thoughts on the revised food bill. She said she felt satisfaction toward the revisions incorporated; however, she hopes that in the future the Senators will take a more inclusive approach toward the campus Boards, Commissions and Committees (BCCs).</p>\n<p>Christianson said much of her discontentment with the previous version of the bill was because it attempted to limit the amount of money each BCC spends on food yet did not initially take into account the different sizes of BCCs and the ways in which the groups use food differently, amongst other issues.</p>\n<p>“It’s very easy for Senate to figure out what Senate needs,” Christianson said. “But BCCs are so diverse … and we’re considered from the outside, which is the biggest problem I think. If somebody would have come to me first and said ‘Hey C.A.B., I know you’re a huge BCC … what would you want?’ I would say, ‘Okay, this seems like a fair policy.’”</p>\n<p>Senators unanimously passed the revised food bill.</p>\n<p>Christianson had similar complaints with the process of devising the A.S. restructure plan, arguing that it was not inclusive enough of BCCs and non-senators in general. When A.S. President Jonathan Abboud presented, he refuted those claims, asserting that he had made an effort to reach out to BCCs. However, Abboud said he recommends that Senators table the resolution.</p>\n<p>“I went to a lot of BCCs’ meetings [with people] who were upset, and I explained it to them … and we sent a lot of emails out … some people didn’t contact me and now they’re in a rut because they waited until five hours before the Senate meeting to read it,” Abboud said. “I would say table it anyways just so that we cannot upset people.”</p>\n<p>After some deliberation, Senators came to an agreement to table the resolution for one more week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared as an online exclusive on Friday, March 7, 2014.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-senate-debates-isla-vista-housing-a-s-restructuring-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-senate-debates-isla-vista-housing-a-s-restructuring-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-senate-debates-isla-vista-housing-a-s-restructuring-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-senate-debates-isla-vista-housing-a-s-restructuring-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/a-s-senate-debates-isla-vista-housing-a-s-restructuring-sexual-assault/","id":3021,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3020,3019,3018],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"VOX Rallies in Response to Recent Sexual Assaults","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood will be holding a march called “Rally for Isla Vista Unity” today at 7:30 p.m. in front of the Student Resource Building to encourage unification efforts within ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood will be holding a march called “Rally for Isla Vista Unity” today at 7:30 p.m. in front of the Student Resource Building to encourage unification efforts within the community in response to the recent sexual assaults in I.V.</p>\n<p>Starting at the SRB, the march will proceed to Pardall Tunnel before moving over to Del Playa Drive and finally heading back to the SRB. During the rally, COSWB will be tabling on campus to offer information and resources on sexual violence, with the help of the Campus Advocacy Resources and Education program. They will also be providing food and refreshments during the event. The rally is organized by the UCSB chapter of VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood, a national pro-choice advocacy group for college students, as well as by Associated Students, A.S. Commission on Student Well Being (COSWB) and Pink Research, a UCSB breast cancer awareness and research group.</p>\n<p>Daisy Fernandez, a first-year sociology and feminist studies double major and VOX member, said she hopes the rally will remind the students and non-students residing in I.V. that sexual assault happens all the time and is underreported.</p>\n<p>“[We] just want to remind that even though each time it happens we all feel really bad … it’s not just those times that it happens — it’s a thing all year round,” Fernandez said.</p>\n<p>Simone Webster, fourth-year religious studies major and VOX Co-Chair, said the march is just the beginning of what she hopes will be a larger effort to get the I.V. community involved in sexual assault prevention. According to Webster, this event marks a “kind of entrance” to the other activities and work VOX hopes to do in the future.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping to start up a neighborhood watch with other organizations; we’re still working out the kinks on that,” Webster said. “From there, we are working on what we can actively do not only as students but as a community because UCSB students are not the only people that live in I.V. — there are Santa Barbara City College students and just residents in general.”</p>\n<p>According to Fernandez, the group is also working with A.S. Senate to improve lighting in I.V. and adjust “outdated” laws governing how the UC deals with sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the streets are super, super dark and really scary,” Webster said. “We always have to tell — more girls than guys — to call CSO [officers], but it’s not addressing the actual problem.”</p>\n<p>Fernandez said she hopes the rally will create a safe place for any previous victims of sexual assault and give them the comfort of a support group.</p>\n<p>“Hey, we’re here for you,” Fernandez said. “Help us help you in any way you want, whether you want a day of silence or anything you want us to give you — any way we can help out.”</p>\n<p>Webster said she hopes to see students, faculty members, advisors, the vice chancellor and other “big honchos of the school” at the rally. While she believes students can play an important role in combatting sexual violence in I.V., Webster said the issue can be better addressed and tackled with the combined efforts of students and non-students.</p>\n<p>“I want to go beyond just UCSB students,” Webster said. “I want everyone out here to make a conscious effort to be proactive and look out for each other.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared as an online exclusive on Friday, March 7, 2014.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/vox-rallies-in-response-to-recent-sexual-assaults/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/vox-rallies-in-response-to-recent-sexual-assaults/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/vox-rallies-in-response-to-recent-sexual-assaults/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/vox-rallies-in-response-to-recent-sexual-assaults/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/vox-rallies-in-response-to-recent-sexual-assaults/","id":3022,"author":{"id":185,"name":"Michael Coronado"},"related":[3021,3020,3019],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
