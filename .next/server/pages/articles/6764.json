Regardless of what the details consisted of, if one were to compile a soundtrack for that summer it would include Walk The Moon’s youthful tune, “Anna Sun,” crafted as if it were made for that summer. Not just because it was named song of the summer by various publications, but because it is difficult to not associate it with breathless, unscathed memories accompanied by the feeling of lightning running wild through the heart. Walk The Moon is giving fans the chance to relive those memories and obtain several more Friday, May 27 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, supported by MisterWives.</p>\n<p>Walk The Moon is the type of band to release a song that will send your emotions spiraling, yet one tends to forget to take the time to get close with their music. There are numerous releases of good music day by day, so it makes it difficult to accomplish such a task. However, when it comes to Walk The Moon, it is rewarding to be more than merely familiar with their music; those that actually take the time to immerse themselves in their sounds might just discover their new favorite song.</p>\n<p>Similar to the love they received for “Anna Sun,” Walk The Moon received overwhelming attention for “Shut Up and Dance,” an upbeat, electric single from their latest album, <em>Talking is Hard</em>. In comparison to a number of their other tracks, the song proves difficult to sit through without singing or dancing from the heart. Out of all of their songs, both “Anna Sun” and “Shut Up and Dance” are the two that the band is commonly associated with, so one could expect to experience the joy flowing off of the stage and into the crowd as people sing in unison with every ounce of love spilling from their lungs.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Apparently a lot; the <em>Nexus</em> hit Coachella 2016, and here are some of Artsweek’s highlights.</p>\n<p><strong>LCD Soundsystem:</strong><br>\nExcessively buzzed about once they announced that they’d be reuniting for a new album and tour in 2016 after their dramatically heartfelt and measured disbanding in 2011, LCD Soundsystem delivered one of the most polished and groovable sets of the weekends. Soundsystem proved apt nomenclature, as main stage became scaffolded with keyboards, drum machines, synths and people to produce the intricately layered and progressive anthems the band churns out. Frontman/visionary James Murphy and an arrangement of longtime compatriots like Nancy Whang and Pat Mahoney riffed seamlessly through their patented danceable tracks that make you think, like “Someone Great,” “Get Innocuous,” “Daft Punk is Playing at My House” and “Dance Yrself Clean.” They also paid tribute to some late greats, with covers of Prince’s “Controversy” and David Bowie’s “Heroes.” “I wasn’t a huge fan of them before going to the festival, but one of my friends convinced me to go. Their music was really powerful. Murphy’s voice was unbelievably good, and their performance definitely made me a huge fan of the band. The set pretty much defined all of Coachella for me,” said UCLA sophomore Andrew Gorin. Such a definitive performance makes the band a welcome addition back into today’s musical landscape; the promise of the buzz was well-kept.</p>\n<p><strong>Sheer Mag:</strong><br>\nSheer Mag lead singer Tina Halladay welcomed the band’s noontime audience at the Mojave tent with an admittedly reticent “Hi, we’re Sheer Mag,” before tearing into the mic with the opening track off of their most recent III EP, “Can’t Stop Fighting.” Halladay carried a quiet yet detectable charisma about her — tough to detect from her notable refrain of crowd interaction but undeniable when her high-pitched vocals ground into a screech — as she belted heartbreak ballads and grievances with the American political system. Even despite the limitations of the 30-minute set length, the low-billing, Philly-based garage band proved to be one of the most impressive sets of the weekend due to their unusual marriage of ‘70s revivalist singing, fuzzy instrumental overlay and genuinely fun high-fi guitar riffs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Algiers:</strong><br>\nHot off of the release of their debut self-titled album, Algiers showcased both one of the most theatrically powerful and technically refined performances of the weekend in spite of their low-billing Saturday afternoon spot at the Mojave tent. Their sound sits somewhere in between post-punk and noise rock with a curveball peppering of gospel and blues. Lead vocalist and guitarist Franklin James Fisher would often spend the first minute of each song crouched on the stage looping cacophonic guitar riffs into a pedal, meticulously tinkering the distortion and then hastily tossing the guitar to the floor in favor of a tambourine and mic. Immediately following every other verse, Fisher collapsed at the knees into a position somewhere between a fetal curl and a prayer kneel, slamming the stage with the tambourine and a closed fist, the sweat on his back often glistening through his white-collared shirt. Songs were punctuated with late 20th century radio samples deploring institutionalized religion and served as the only nonmusical communication between band and audience. This was easily one of the most impressive sets of the weekend.</p>\n<p><strong>Courtney Barnett:</strong><br>\nCourtney Barnett has been on the receiving end of quite a bit of accolade, with her debut album Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit making many 2015 year-end lists and earning her a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. Her distinctive lyrical style always feels like aimless meandering through vividly mundane yet accessible scenes of poolside crushes as a conduit for profound thought exploration, while always remaining playful enough to land far away from any sense of pretention. During “Elevator Operator” and “Small Poppies,” Barnett was brought to her knees mid-guitar solo in an act of rocker-geist possession often caricatured in bad ’70s hair metal bands but perfected by the endearingly manic Jack Whites and Dan Auerbachs of the world. In between songs, she awkwardly chuckled and said things like “We like you guys,” or a simple “Thanks,” almost as if her manager told her she had to be nice to her fans. More likely, though, she’s just that lone person at the party exchanging clunky pleasantries, but is actually super sweet once you get to know her.</p>\n<p><strong>Anderson .Paak &amp; The Free Nationals:</strong><br>\n2016 is the year of .Paak. Born Brandon Paak Anderson, the R&amp;B singer, songwriter, drummer, producer and rapper has largely slipped under the radar of hip hop fans for the majority of his professional music career. However, 2015 was exceptionally kind to .Paak, as Dr. Dre plucked the rapper out of obscurity to contribute to a whopping eight tracks on Dr. Dre’s latest release, Compton. .Paak’s January release, Malibu, has garnered him widespread media attention, citing his compositional complexity, strong lyrical content and energetic live performance. .Paak spent much of his Coachella performance bouncing between his mic and his drum kit with the only consistency throughout the performance confined to the intermittent declarations of his catch phrase, “Yes, Lord!” and his cheek-to-cheek, white-toothed grin. Both Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar came out in support of the budding star, a testament to both .Paak’s talent and his future enshrinement into the pantheon of West Coast musical legends.</p>\n<p><strong>Sufjan Stevens:</strong><br>\nAfter touring with an intimate and human set to support his last effort, 2015’s quiet and folky Carrie &amp; Lowell, fans didn’t know quite what to expect from the adeptly talented multi-instrumentalist in a 2016 festival setting. Flanked by a groovy Valkyrie duo of backup dancer-singers, a kinetic brass trio and eventually a cropping of inflatable air dancers, Stevens delivered an extravagantly theatrical act. There was banjo smashing, disco balling and costume changing (Suf wore erratic costumes ranging from a set of gigantic feathery wings, a get-up of dozens of swaying and bouncing mylar balloons, to a towering set piece resembling a crucifix-esque metallic jellyfish). He blasted through Age of Adz touchstones like “Too Much” and the 25-minute “Impossible Soul.” Even his C&amp;L cuts were arranged up to match the energy, culminating with a performance of “Fourth of July” in which Stevens and his backup cried out emphatically the refrain that “We’re all gonna die.” “It was a big change from the last time I saw him, in a really good way,” fourth-year biopsych major Roni Brawley said, who also called his timely Gallant-accompanied cover of “Purple Rain,” “moving.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sia:</strong><br>\nThe enigmatic Australian songstress held down main stage Sunday night with one of the most bizarrely artistic and moving sets to grace the polo fields in, possibly ever. Obscured in the corner by her signature black-and-blonde wig and a dwarfing oversized white bow, Sia let her belting vocals and a slew of guests weave her story of pain, depression and triumph. The set bolstered hits like “Diamonds,” “Titanium” and “Chandelier” with performance art conducted by the eclectic likes of a tearful Kristin Wiig, a bewildered and accosted Paul Dano, frequent collaborator and dance prodigy Maddie Ziegler and more, all unified under matching checkerboard wigs to match the songstress’s striking aesthetic. The level of artistry presented by the set was unprecedented for the festival, especially when stacked against the droves of partiers shoving through the agape crowd to camp out for Calvin Harris’s following set.</p>\n<p>Speaking of artistry, the visuals at this year’s fest were notably more subdued than the imaginatively photogenic fare of previous years. Poetic Kinetics, the design studio behind iconic works like the enormous and mobile snail, astronaut, and caterpillar/butterfly mascots were conspicuously absent this year, and the Do Lab stage, while still the center for free-for-all bone-vibrating bass and PLURality, re-used its Big Fish stage setup, which debuted last year. Rumors have abounded about the hefty sum Goldenvoice hoisted over to Guns N’ Roses for their headlining gig, siphoned off from supporting more visual artists. Whether these are founded or not, the money must’ve gone somewhere; in regard to the huge “Besame Mucho” piece backgrounding the polo field, senior Lauren Gutches scoffed astutely “Just because they’re in a different language doesn’t make giant words any more interesting as art.” Portals, a piece by Philip K. Smith, was a noticeable standout amidst the stagnance of the other works, reflecting and shifting subtly in light and color, as fourth-year Josh Swedelson noted, “like an Apple Store display crossed with the ‘Hotline Bling’ background.” As people posed for photos in front of the piece’s glowing rings, opening their own portals into their lives and themselves to become a part of the piece, the mirrored slats reflected outward onto the other-worldly festival outsides raging like the desert winds. Through music, art and, well, a lot of other things, Coachella offers portals into another universe for a weekend, one that it was a pleasure to get lost in.</p><div

“Heading Home” tour, the multi-instrumentalist and music producer, Gryffin, made a special pit stop at UC Santa Barbara in The Hub last Thursday, May 5, for a special pre-Extravaganza performance hosted by A.S. Program Board. The musician, whose real name is Dan Griffith, first learned to play music via the piano at a very young age. “I started taking classical piano lessons when I was seven. I’ve been playing instruments for a while, and then I picked up the guitar when I was in middle school,” Gryffin shared in an exclusive interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em>. Infused with live elements of an electric guitar, piano keyboard and melodic house beats, Gryffin’s sound is immediately presumed to be influenced by the classic rock genre.</p>\n<p>“Even when I was younger, my older cousin Dustin was in this band called Thrice — which was a punk, hardcore-type band. I idolized him growing up and went to a lot of his shows,” the producer reminisced of his early musical inspirations.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70929\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1401915147\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70927\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70929\" data-attachment-id=\"70929\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/artsweek-sits-down-turns-up-with-gryffin/chrome-sparks-hub_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Chrome Sparks Hub_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70929 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Chrome Sparks Hub_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70929\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The opening DJs, UCSB’s own Conner McEuen a.k.a.

It’s like a serious throw back song now, but I remember looking back listening to that, and being like, ‘what is this music, this is insane,’ it’s sort of what opened my eyes.”</p>\n<p>With a series of original remixed hits such as Banks’ “Beggin For Thread,” Years’ “Desire” and BØRNS’ “Electric Love,” the Bay Area native accompanied each track with a live instrument of a guitar or keyboard for a fresh, unique sound. Most notably known for working with new artists like those mentioned above, Gryffin is a champion for rising talents. “Something about the up and comers, like supporting the music that is on the rise, it’s really exciting to work in that wheel house because it’s like fresh ideas and fresh inspiration — just like being in the mentality and mindset of those types of artists,” Gryffin said. “I’m really inspired by Bob Moses. I got to do a bunch of stuff with them at SXSW and Ultra — which was really cool.”</p>\n<p>The highlight of the night was Gryffin’s original production with singer Josef Salvat in the record titled, “Heading Home.” As the artist/producer’s first ever single, the track is an uplifting dance anthem that speaks of finding a guiding path in life amidst of the chaos and hardships. The song is a big transition for the musician, who has thus far only released remixes of original songs from various artists. A big surprise of the night came from an appearance of singer and UCSB student Grace Nevins, who sang a new, unreleased track, “Love In Ruins.”</p>\n<p>“I think ultimately the remixes is how I got my name out there to begin with so I don’t have to abandon that at all. I still enjoy doing it, but over the course of the next year, it’s definitely going to be more of a focus to do my own stuff,” Gryffin spoke about his new music. “I’m working on an EP right now. I’ve got another single that is almost finished that I’ll probably come out with in June. I’m just actively pursuing and working on a bunch of new content”.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70930\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1846474080\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70927\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70930\" data-attachment-id=\"70930\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/artsweek-sits-down-turns-up-with-gryffin/gryffin-in-the-hub-5-5-16-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gryffin in the Hub 5-5-16\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-70930\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70930\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>To conclude the night, Gryffin ended his set with his most famous remix, Tove Lo’s “Talking Body,” (which was also the song that introduced me to the artist). With 17 million plays on both SoundCloud and Spotify, “Talking Body” has catapulted the musician to a wider audience of fans and music critics. After playing the final guitar chord of the song, the musician thanked the audience for coming to see the show. The 26-year-old debuted his live performance this past New Year’s Eve at SnowGlobe Music Festival and has been headlining his first tour ever since. Gryffin is ultimately looking forward to some free time to obtain brand new inspiration after finishing up his sold out tour, “I get to enjoy a few months off in the summer to write music, which is gonna be sweet!”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Sweater weather may be over for Santa Barbara natives, but as of this Tuesday, The Neighbourhood will be bringing it back in full force to the Majestic Ventura Theater. The show was originally booked at the Santa Barbara Bowl but made a move to the Majestic Ventura Theater, where all tickets will be honored.</p>\n<p>The two EPs <em>I’m</em> <em>Sorry </em>and <em>Thank You </em>and debut album <em>I Love You</em> respectively were the building blocks for the success of the band we as they are today. They became known for their black and white aesthetic, as seen in their scenic rotating clips for songs like “Flawless” and “WDYWFM,” along with their overall social media presence. With their appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” The Neighbourhood performed a stylish live television debut in black and white. Even after the departure of their original drummer Bryan Sammis, their status as the band to be on the lookout for remained, as did their loyal fanbase dedicated to decoding their cryptic melodies. In 2014 The Neighbourhood dropped a mixtape titled <em>#000000 &amp; #FFFFFF</em>. The mixtape consisted of several singles the band had previously released along with a few new ones featuring artists like YG, Raury and French Montana.</p>\n<p>After the release of the mixtape, however, the band went off the radar for a span of time to recover from the constant shows and festivals they had booked as well as to get to the root of what their next work of art would be. Out of this brief hiatus bloomed their sophomore album<em> Wiped Out!,</em> a fiery, complex treasure that would take all of their fans and critics by surprise. Listening to the album by its lonesome is a journey, so seeing The Neighbourhood bring it to life will be a vivid experience. There is no doubt that this band aims to please, and it would be an honor for anyone to say they were in attendance when the Majestic Ventura Theater got “wiped out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70831\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/the-neighbourhood-to-wipe-out-majestic-ventura-theater/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70831\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/the-neighbourhood-to-wipe-out-majestic-ventura-theater/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/the-neighbourhood-to-wipe-out-majestic-ventura-theater/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/the-neighbourhood-to-wipe-out-majestic-ventura-theater/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/the-neighbourhood-to-wipe-out-majestic-ventura-theater/","id":6763,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6762,6761,6760],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
