More than 10 years since the initial attack on the twin towers, I watched President Obama’s address to the nation confirming bin Laden’s death as my body was emotionally overwhelmed with shock, pride for my nation and a feeling that justice had been served. His death has avenged the roughly 3,000 that perished in the assault on our country and provided some closure to the families that suffered a loss and a city who felt vulnerable after the tragedies of 9/11.</p>\n<p>However, after the initial elation had withdrawn from my body, I was left with emptiness and harsh reality of the situation. Eliminating the leader of al-Qaeda has not and will not defeat the deep-rooted and extensive network of al-Qaeda. I believe the deceased leader will only be glorified as a martyr and will serve as a catalyst for more violence and attacks from the extremists who followed him. I think of it much like a starfish: You can sever every appendage, but it will always regenerate. America’s efforts to track and kill bin Laden have proved to be more of a trophy for bragging rights than a productive step toward eliminating terrorism. At the least, America has displayed to the world something that has been proven countless times before: Our nation holds an aggressive foreign policy with a very superior, efficient and violent military machine to achieve its objectives.</p>\n<p>The only concluding thoughts I have pulled from bin Laden’s assassination is that our nation and leaders have been fooled into thinking we as a country can erase terrorism from the world. By the mouths of officials and the talking heads in media, terror has been put into a neatly packaged and nicely labeled entity called al-Qaeda. Unfortunately, terror is far beyond an organization of extremists and its essence transcends the realm of tangibility. Rather, it is an idea and a philosophy which will be used forever by those who sense a polarity in ideals, culture and religion. As long as homogeneity exists within the world, there will be conflict and thus terrorism.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/destroying-murderous-ideology-important-killing-leader/","id":6200,"author":{"id":566,"name":"Cameron Jones"},"related":[6199,6198,6197],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":566,"name":"Cameron Jones","biography":"Not available","articles":[6200],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Funding Horowitz With Student Funds Seen As Discriminatory","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I didn’t attend the A.S.

Standing up and using your speech is not equivalent to yelling “fire” in a crowded room. It’s ironic that the same people against government intrusion are in the process of creating a police state, but that’s another issue. It’s clear that if groups of students are willing to attend an event just to disrupt it, the event is not welcome on our campus. Take note, this is exercising free speech.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“One of my club members confided … he had never felt more discriminated against and personally targeted in his entire life.”</p>\n<p>OK. Welcome to being everyone other than a white male in America. It’s about time someone told you ‘no,’ because the real world is full of people who won’t agree with you. Know what would actually be discriminatory? If we brought a speaker to campus who accused all white people of being in the KKK.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sound familiar?

The investment community is questioning our government’s ability to maintain sound fiscal and monetary policy and is warning that our long-term rating will be reduced. How has it come to this?</p>\n<p>In 2008, our gross public debt over 230-plus years was about $10 trillion. Over the next three years, our country will amass a new debt of about $4.5 trillion.  World War II cost our country about $4 trillion in 2009 dollars. Our gross national debt is now approaching our gross domestic product which signals a historical turning point of economic and social decline.</p>\n<p>The present generation borrows about 40 cents of every dollar spent by the government from its children, and our Federal Reserve has been purchasing over 70 percent of our newly issued bonds with newly printed dollars. The resulting inflation that results from this expansion of the money supply will dramatically reduce the value of savings for the young, poor and aged.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It’s now clear that we cannot continue spending money that we don’t have and printing money to buy (“monetize”) our own debt. We are on the fast track to a very predictable fiscal trainwreck if we do not make significant changes in our budget, and soon.</p>\n<p>We have a chronic spending problem. We simply can’t afford the government we have, and it will destroy our society if we remain on this present course. Worst of all, young people — college students who are the next generation — will bear the brunt of our government’s irresponsible spending.</p>\n<p>It’s their future earnings we are spending today, and it is simply immoral.</p>\n<p>But it gets worse — our government has made promises that cannot be kept. Between Medicare,  Medicaid and Social Security, our country faces about $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities. There is zero chance those commitments can be met, and most people intuitively know this. Almost nobody under the age of 50 believes they will get Social Security or Medicare in its current form.</p>\n<p>The recently passed House budget framework attempts to address the issue for Medicare and Medicaid, the most problematic programs. But Democrats have responded with the predictable “throw grandma under the bus” charges.  Don’t buy into it: In Paul Ryan’s budget plan, people in the system now and 55 or older will face no changes to their entitlements.</p>\n<p>The reality is our entitlement programs are guaranteed to fail if we continue on our current path. The proposed budget tries to save Medicare, not destroy it.  If our politicians continue to demagogue the issue, scare seniors and kick the proverbial can down the road, the fixes will be far more drastic and much more painful. But they will come.</p>\n<p>Allow me to dispel another myth that is impeding our escape from the fiscal abyss: This problem cannot be solved on the back of the “rich.” The President’s solution is to raise taxes on couples making over $250 thousand a year, and make them pay their “fair” share. The reality is that the U.S. already has one of the most progressive tax systems on the planet.</p>\n<p>According to 2008 IRS data, the top 2 percent ($250 thousand and over) of taxpayers pay roughly 50 percent of all income taxes while earning 25 percent of U.S. income. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay zero income tax.</p>\n<p>The government could tax all income over $250 thousand at 100 percent and it still would not close this year’s deficit — in fact, it would destroy our economy in the process. Regardless of top marginal tax rates, we have historically captured about 19 percent of GDP in tax revenues while we are currently spending about 25 percent of GDP.</p>\n<p>More importantly, how does taking money out of the private economy through higher taxes help that private economy grow? It won’t. Spending is the primary impediment to economic recovery that we face today.</p>\n<p>The House budget isn’t perfect, but it is a good start towards dealing with our chronic deficits and long-term fiscal health; at least it has a template for balancing the budget. The President’s budget doesn’t come close.</p>\n<p>It is time to get serious about spending. Investors will not continue to fund our debt if they think we will just devalue their bonds by printing money. We simply cannot tax, spend, borrow and print our way to prosperity: Either we enforce our own spending discipline or the bond markets will enforce it for us, as the warning shot from S&amp;P demonstrated.</p>\n<p>One way or another, the spending party is over. Young Americans should be jumping for joy — you’ll be much better off.</p>\n<p>Tom Watson is a local entrepreneur and former Congressional candidate for the 23rd district.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/negligent-government-spending-prohibits-prosperity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/negligent-government-spending-prohibits-prosperity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/negligent-government-spending-prohibits-prosperity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/negligent-government-spending-prohibits-prosperity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-28/negligent-government-spending-prohibits-prosperity/","id":6198,"author":{"id":565,"name":"Tom Watson"},"related":[6197,6196,6195],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Letter to the Editor from Bruce Porter","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/3429.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/3429.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Make no mistake, I humbly ask for your vote, freely given and purposefully bestowed.

My opponent, Joan Hartmann, shortly thereafter joined him on social media. My name is Bruce Porter and I wish to speak to you, the readers of this newspaper and the students of this great institution.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake, I humbly ask for your vote, freely given and purposefully bestowed.

The difference between Mr. Williams, Ms. Hartmann and I is that I have greater respect for your technological knowledge and your understanding of precautions to protect yourself from identity theft.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In a free exchange of ideas I have great confidence in your ability to participate in your right and privilege to vote and to personally and responsibly register and exercise that franchise without partisan nannies to do the work for you. Das Williams and Joan Hartmann do not have the same confidence in your abilities.</p>\n<p>I have dedicated my candidacy to posing real solutions to problems that have plagued our county. One such solution was an outreach to students and residents of UCSB and Isla Vista to avail themselves of the most secure and efficient methods for voter registration. To that end I sought the input of a woman with a gift for establishing a deep and meaningful rapport with students and local citizens, and for that she has now become a target of my opponent’s campaign.</p>\n<p>Let me ask you: What is the more secure release of personal information? Is it to hand a total stranger, your name, date of birth, driver license number and social security number on a card with no knowledge of to whom or to where it’s going, or is it to input directly on a State of California secure server? This is, after all, the 21st century.</p>\n<p>Terry Baxter is a single mom, a grandmother, an SBCC student and a passionate believer in the promise of local government to solve local problems and address real needs. When you meet her, you’ll find she is of great conviction and won’t be bullied. She and I will share our ideas like Isla Vista 2.0 to give you a voice in your own future and in that of Isla Vista and to provide to Isla Vista its rightful share of county resources, on the ground, where they are needed.<br>\nIf you’ll give me a chance, I’ll share my other ideas for listening to residents and working together to provide solutions to improve Santa Barbara County for all of us.<br>\n<em><br>\nBruce Porter served as an officer of the U.S. Corps of Engineers, and currently serves on the Santa Ynez Valley Union High School Board.
