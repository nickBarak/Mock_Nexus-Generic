Hawaii, meanwhile, improves to 11-9 on the season with a 5-4 mark in conference play after outrebounding the Gauchos by 15.</p>\n<p>“I think they’re more physical than us. We’re not as physical as we need to be,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Most games we play in, it has not been as big a problem because we have one very physical human being (Alan Williams) down in the low paint area to kind of mop things up.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Junior forward Christian Standhardinger led the Rainbow Warriors with a career-high 31 point, 16 rebound performance. Even more impressive, Standhardinger only had four points at the break, exploding for 27 in the second half.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good player,” Coach Williams said. “He’s what this league doesn’t have a lot of, a 6’8” wing-type player that’s got a body on him. In this league he can play anywhere from the two to the five. He hurts you in a lot of ways.”</p>\n<p>Clearly overmatched down low due to the absence of Williams, UCSB opted to try its luck from long range, attempting 28 three-pointers, compared to 10 for Hawaii. The Gauchos converted nine of those opportunities, but its top two three-point shooters in freshman forward Taran Brown and junior guard Kyle Boswell were a combined 1-15 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Taran didn’t do much for his percentage tonight,” Coach Williams said. “It’s a bad shooting night out of those two. You have to give people some credit, they’re doing some good things on Bos.”</p>\n<p>Brown led UCSB with 15 points and six rebounds, but shot 7-23 on the night including a dismal 1-12 from behind the arc. Boswell was second on the team with 12 points, but was 0-3 on three-pointers. Sophomore guard T.J. Taylor notched 11 points and four assists on the night, while senior guard Nate Garth had eight points and eight assists.</p>\n<p>Out with injury for much of the season, junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle provided UCSB with solid play with eight points, two assists and two steals in 21 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>“The guy that I actually thought had a pretty decent game again was Keegan Hornbuckle in terms of doing what he is capable of doing and having to play more minutes than he is capable of right now,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Fouls plagued UCSB for much of the night as Hawaii shot 39 free throws. Santa Barbara was outrebounded 45-30 on the night and allowed 20 second chance points to the Rainbow Warriors.</p>\n<p>“Not having [Big Al] isn’t really an excuse for not boxing someone out,” Boswell said. “We just let them climb our backs and get second chance points all night long. You literally can’t beat a team that’s that big and not box them out.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii snapped a two-game losing streak with the victory and won its first Big West road victory since moving to the conference this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces Long Beach State on the road on Wednesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 28th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49767\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/ucsb-falls-in-televised-game-to-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49767\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/ucsb-falls-in-televised-game-to-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/ucsb-falls-in-televised-game-to-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/ucsb-falls-in-televised-game-to-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-28/ucsb-falls-in-televised-game-to-hawaii/","id":694,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[693,692,691],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Remain Winless at Home, Fall to Fresno St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"Once again, the UCSB women's basketball team was haunted by its inconsistencies and suffered its sixth-straight loss Thursday night.

I freaked out with the ball sometimes and then once we got comfortable we realized there’s teams who play way better defense than that,” I said. “They’re not any better than we are, we’re just making mistakes. So it’s not necessarily the pressure it’s just us [needing to be] comfortable on offense, slowing down and making the right plays.”</p>\n<p>With roughly a minute to go, the Gauchos bounced back from their cold start as senior forward Chaya Durr knocked down two free throws to get things rolling. Then, sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez and senior guard Makala Roper hit two threes, Roper’s at the buzzer, to end the first period with an 8-0 run. UCSB found itself behind the Bulldogs 20-15.</p>\n<p>Despite managing to play from behind and cut the deficit, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson was unhappy with her team’s performance early, and stressed the importance of starting games with the right attitude.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to have a better start, obviously, and better energy, and better discipline on the defensive end. This team’s got to grow where they get some energy from the defensive end,” Henrickson said. “I think we get really excited when we make threes. I don’t think we get really excited from a stop. We’ve got to be more aggressive in the passing lanes, more aggressive on the ball.”</p>\n<p>With the second quarter underway, the Gauchos’ offensive struggles returned as they did not score until the 6:53 mark.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter came off the bench to drain two threes to tie the game at 23 apiece with 4:20 remaining. Porter, one of only three Gauchos in double digit scoring, contributed 12 points off the bench. The Bulldogs answered with a 9-3 run to close out the quarter, ending the half up 32-26.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos seemed to settle down during halftime, coming out with a more focused energy to start the third.</p>\n<p>After going down 40-31 with roughly four minutes to go, the Gauchos went on an 11-4 run to close out the quarter and cut the Bulldog lead to two. Santa Barbara used three pointers from Aliceah Hernandez, Sarah Porter and Sarah Bates plus a five-point quarter from Durr for its run. Durr scored a team-high 16 points and pulled down a team-high six boards.</p>\n<p>“We finally settled down. But there’s no reason for us to be down at home right away,” Henrickson said.</p>\n<p>Down 44-42 to start the fourth, Durr scored on a nice drive to the basket to tie the game at 44. Although the Gauchos shot below 40 percent from the free-throw line, beyond the arc and overall, they took their first lead of the night with 7:26 left in the game.</p>\n<p>Hernandez gave her team the lead off a made three-ball, but it would be Santa Barbara’s only lead of the game.</p>\n<p>The Bulldogs pulled ahead again with 5:21 remaining to take a 52-50. Santa Barbara’s defense had a hard time stopping Candice White and Maddi Utti in the final minutes. White and Utti scored eight and six in the period, respectively, to pull Fresno St. ahead 60-54 with 46 seconds to go. White, a junior guard, ended the game with 19 points and a game-high 11 boards.</p>\n<p>Following a UCSB timeout, Hernandez came off a screen to quickly drain a three, but with only 39 seconds left, the Gauchos were forced to foul.</p>\n<p>Up 60-57, the Bulldogs missed two free throws but got the ball back on a long rebound, forcing Santa Barbara to foul again. The Gauchos couldn’t get any other desperation threes to fall, losing the game by a final score of 64-57.</p>\n<p>After the game, Coach Henrickson addressed her team’s performance on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have everybody on the same page, right now, defensively,” she said. “I love our confidence, but our discipline is ridiculous. We’ve got to develop more discipline. We’ve got to play the right way, there’s a purpose to what we’re trying to do.”</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos losing their sixth straight, there are obvious improvements that need to be made so that Santa Barbara can play with more consistency rather than having to catch up.</p>\n<p>“We had a really good practice [Wednesday] so we’re waiting for this to transition from practice to consistency in a game,” Henrickson said. “Everybody’s disappointed, not discouraged. I still believe we’ve got a chance.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have a chance to bounce back when they visit No. 7 UCLA on Sunday, Dec. 3 at 1:30 p.m. at Pauley Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-01/gauchos-remain-winless-at-home-fall-to-fresno-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-01/gauchos-remain-winless-at-home-fall-to-fresno-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-01/gauchos-remain-winless-at-home-fall-to-fresno-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-01/gauchos-remain-winless-at-home-fall-to-fresno-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-01/gauchos-remain-winless-at-home-fall-to-fresno-st/","id":691,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[690,689,688],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hungry for Third Straight Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Tonight against UC Riverside, the UCSB women’s basketball team will have the opportunity to do something they have yet to do all season: win three consecutive games.

UCSB handily defeated Northridge for the 12th consecutive time, using a 20-6 second half run and solid defense to earn a 56-37 victory. Against Hawaii, in a game that went down to the wire, junior guard Nicole Nesbit came up with the winning basket to give the Gauchos a 51-50 victory and hand the Rainbow Wahine their first home conference loss of the year.</p>\n<p>“We never want to get too high or too low,” junior guard Melissa Zornig said. “It was great that we got those two wins, but we still need to take care of business the next couple games and take it game by game.”</p>\n<p>At 5-4, UCSB has proved it can win on the road, but now Santa Barbara will have to prove it can win at home as the Gauchos are only 2-5 at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done a better job on the road of sticking to the key things — our defensive principles and executing offensively,” Underwood said. “We have yet to do that at home.”</p>\n<p>Riverside enters the game in ninth place in conference at 9-9 overall and 2-5 in league and has lost two straight games.</p>\n<p>“You can look at their record and it can be misleading,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “They had a great win against Washington State in the Pac-12 and they beat Long Beach State, who beat us, so I don’t think their record is indicative of the type of team they are or the abilities that they have.”</p>\n<p>Riverside features possibly the best player in the Big West in senior guard Tre’Shonti Nottingham, who leads the conference in points with 18.3 and ranks second in steals with 2.9 per game. “She’s a big time player,” Underwood said. “She’s a point guard who does it all. They run everything through and to her and our game plan is to throw a couple different bodies on her.” Although known for their defense, holding teams to a league-leading 54.5 points per game, the Gauchos have put together two straight solid offensive performances. Against Northridge and Hawaii, the team averaged 47.3 percent shooting from the field.</p>\n<p>“We’re still taking fewer shots than our opponents, so to me, that’s key,” Mitchell said. “That probably means we’re taking good shots. We’re not shooting quick shots in transition and it’s more of an attack mentality.”</p>\n<p>Fueling UCSB’s offense has been Underwood, who won this week’s Big West Player of the Week Award after a double-double against Northridge and a 13-point performance in Hawaii. Overall, she ranks third in the Big West in rebounding, grabbing 8.5 boards per contest, and fourth in field goal percentage at 50.9 percent.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 31st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div

lead.</p>\n<p>Those would be the guard’s only points until close to the end of the first half, as the Big West Player of the Week was never really able to find his footing on the offensive end, going 5-for-15 from the field for 18 points.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, both senior Gabe Vincent and graduate transfer Marcus Jackson were more than ready to step into the offensive role that Heidegger usually filled.</p>\n<p>Vincent has seen his production go down this year, which isn’t too surprising coming off a major injury.</p>\n<p>The guard scored 11 points in the first half, and had an answer for each USF make.</p>\n<p>He made a pivotal shot halfway through the first; when the Gauchos had conceded two shots in a row and trailed by five, he knocked in a long jumper to keep it a one-possession game. Down the stretch, both he and Jackson made tough plays that offset some of the problems UCSB had rebounding.</p>\n<p>Jackson finished with 10 points on 3-of-6 shooting from the field and a 2-for-3 performance behind the 3-PT line.</p>\n<p>For the Dons, senior forward Chase Foster played a huge role in ensuring that the game was tied at halftime.</p>\n<p>He scored or assisted on the last eight points of the half and led both teams at halftime with 14 points.</p>\n<p>His outside shooting (2-for-4 in the first half from three) spread the Gauchos’ defense out, which was key in the rebounding advantage that the Dons took into halftime.</p>\n<p>In the second half, the talent of the Gauchos was just too much for the Dons as the game devolved into a slugfest.</p>\n<p>The teams combined for 27 fouls in the period, and with both teams missing a boatload of threes (USF went 6-for-33 and UCSB 6-for-19), it came down to who could make the tough shots.</p>\n<p>The answer to that question was graduate transfer Leland King II, who had yet another double-double in this game with 21 points and 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The forward led all players in scoring in and down the stretch, using his combination of length and skill to get key buckets in a short time.</p>\n<p>With about five minutes to go, he knocked in back-to-back buckets, which moved the UCSB lead up to five.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos never looked back, eventually getting the seven-point victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes back home Saturday night to host the University of San Diego.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest changes that the team is looking to make is not on the court, but rather the culture and atmosphere surrounding the program off of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re trying to build this program to have a dominant home court,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack explained. “We need all the students to come out and support these guys. I think they’ll be excited to see the team that we have, which includes one of the top scorers in the country (Max Heidegger is 10th in the NCAA) and Santa Barbara’s best record since 2010.”</span></p>\n<p>The Toreros are a perfect 5-0 to start off the year, and they come into the matchup led by guard Isaiah Wright, who has done a little bit of everything for San Diego so far.</p>\n<p>The Boise State transfer is averaging 14.2 points, 6 assists and 6 rebounds a game, leading his team in all three categories.</p>\n<p>The task of covering him will probably be up to Jackson and Heidegger, although the great team defense of the Gauchos will make sure that Wright sees a lot of long bodies coming his way throughout the game.</p>\n<p>If UCSB stays composed on offense and communicates well on defense, it could have a good chance of ending yet another win streak.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 30, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.
