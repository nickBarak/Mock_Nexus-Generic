A diverse crowd of teachers, students and adults packed the room, leaving very little space to encompass any further persons. A table and four microphones adorned the stage, patiently waiting for the presence of Black Panther members Emory Douglas and Akinsanya Kambon. Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Black Panthers, the revolutionaries spoke on how they employed art as a way to reflect the struggles and cultural history of African Americans and their rebellion to the oppression in their society. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd anxiously awaited Douglas to take the stage as Professor Diane Fujino began the event. Introducing an atmosphere of solidarity and cross cultural support, a group of indigenous Chumash Indians took to the stage to thank and honor the speakers for their attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emory Douglas took to the stage, his presence so intense that the room echoed silence, and his first words rang powerfully through the ears of his listeners, “All power to the people!”; this was recited back to him with a fervor that matched those protesting the streets of IV. He introduced his position within the party, the Minister of Culture, as he played a video of the Panthers detailing his role. Douglas had constructed iconic images, that embodied the Black Panther Party’s persona of the militant and revolutionary poor, one that resonated with and began to define the insurgent minority. A powerpoint of his art plastered the vast screen behind him, allowing the audience to fully experience his art. Douglas spoke of a widely unknown narrative, one seldom affiliated with the panthers: the community work the Panthers engaged in and the role his art played in further inciting change. He used his artwork “to enlighten, to educate and to inform” the community through the BPP’s newspaper– he worked “to create a culture of resistance” in his community. His art flashed across the screen behind him, branding the social commentary into the minds of his viewers. The stark images, in very little color, told stories of the social and political climate of the time, some very similar to that of our contemporary world. It was art based on necessity, what was the most impactful, made with the resources they had. As Douglas finished, the audience erupted into swarm of cheers and clapping as he left the stage.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Devin Clark thought the event was awesome. “I didn’t know what to expect, but it was so enlightening.” When asked what was taken from the conversations, Clark replied “they played their part and now it’s our time and our responsibility to do our part”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crowd calmed down, Akinsanya Kambon walked up the to the stage and proclaimed “art must be used to uplift and educate humanity”. Students and adults riled up once again, cheered as he began speaking. He spoke of the atrocities of his tour in Vietnam, exposing the discrepancies in society, juxtaposing those he saw in his day with those prevalent now. Kambon demanded respect as he stood tall, voice chiming through the room disregarding any politeness. His words, raw and unrestrained, were so powerful and inspiring, that his speech was continually interrupted by cheers from the audience. He spoke of the importance of culture and heritage and how that inspired his art. He spoke of how the BPP educated him, influencing the construction of his famous </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Panther Coloring Book. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next part of the event was a “conversation with the artists”, Douglas and Kambon talked with Professors Diane Fujino and Felice Blake. They covered questions of how the BPP utilized and taught literacy, the influences of their art and the international reach of the Black Panther Party, comparing these to the issues today. The audience hung onto each word, dripping with eagerness to ask their own questions to the revolutionaries. Finally the questions were opened to all and a sea of hands sprang up; many were anxious with inquiry. Topics concerning Colin Kaepernick, imperialism and Donald Trump’s presidency arose, along with more broad questions of how to create political and social change, how to dismantle the oppressive systems and the purpose of protest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The event was concluded as Emiliano Martinez, a representative of the American Indian Movement, played an honoring song to the Panther members, creating a lasting atmosphere of solidarity. UCSB student Kate Thorsland really enjoyed the event and was glad she came out. “It really resonated with me because of what is going on politically right now. Movements like this are deemed “radical” but are necessary. This event was definitely well timed for me as unfortunately the same issues are happening now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Multicultural Center then hosted a reception afterwards to honor the artwork created by both Douglas and Kambon. I was able to speak to Kambon and ask him what advice he would give to UCSB students looking to create change. “Organize and change the world,” he said, “don’t worry about politicians, they’re a part of the system that wants to keep the status quo. Change is up to you”.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74329\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74329\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/art-of-the-black-panther-party-celebrates-a-revolution/","id":6525,"author":{"id":737,"name":"Savanah Marshall"},"related":[6524,6523,6522],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":737,"name":"Savanah Marshall","biography":"Not available","articles":[6525,6786],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Reminiscing Over the 2010s With These Iconic UCSB Shows","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Performing Art","publish_date":"2020-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SnoopDoog_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-41.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SnoopDoog_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-41.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Here’s a list of the best performances that have taken place here at UCSB over the last decade!","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Here’s a list of the best performances that have taken place here at UC Santa Barbara over the last decade (2010-2019)!</p>\n<p><strong>Steve Aoki (Jan. 8, 2010 &amp; March 31, 2011)</strong><br>\nUCSB alum turned DJ, Steve Aoki brought his beats back to Isla Vista for a free performance at the Hub.

weekend in the Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall, bringing a showstopper performance of the 1999 British musical.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The musical was much anticipated by students and was met with a successful reception, achieving a nearly packed house on its Saturday showing. After four months of rehearsing, “Mamma Mia!” was unveiled as the company’s first show of 2020, executed with a skill that rivals the hit 2008 “Mamma Mia!” film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a film franchise that grossed over $144 million in its first installment alone, “Mamma Mia!” is a narrative so iconic that its plot hardly needs an explanation. Sophie, a 20-year-old bride-to-be, prepares for her wedding by sending invitations to three of her mother’s former love interests. After stumbling upon their names in a diary entry, Sophie realizes that her mother’s affairs with these men coincide during the time of her conception. Hilarity ensues as the men arrive at the wedding venue, leaving Sophie to suss out which one of them may be her true father.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The choice of “Mamma Mia!” as Shrunken Heads’s winter musical is particularly interesting, given the reputation of “Mamma Mia!” as a summertime film. Christian Duarte, director and third-year student at UC Santa Barbara, pitched the idea to perform “Mamma Mia!” last year, wanting to produce a show that was more lighthearted than the company’s previous productions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Both of last year’s shows were sort of devastating in the experience of it all, just by covering such dark and heavy topics,” Duarte said in an </span><a href=\"https://newspress.com/life/2020/ucsbs-shrunken-heads-presents-mamma-mia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the Santa Barbara News-Press</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just wanted to do something that was really fun.” Duarte’s theatrical direction more than achieves this goal, with “Mamma Mia!” being far from a downer production. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one, the musical is brilliantly cast, full of actors who exude the dramatic energy and vocal talent that originally brought “Mamma Mia!” to fame. At times, it is hard for the audience to believe that the musical is entirely student-run, looking at the sheer talent and attention to detail in the show’s choreography, set design and, of course, the singing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people are going to be surprised by the caliber of a production that can be put on by a student group with virtually no money,” said Mikayla Knight, who plays Sophie’s mother, Donna. “This is all from scratch, this is a club, this is something that students are voluntarily rehearsing for three or four nights a week.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The troupe did not disappoint die-hard “Mamma Mia!” fans, giving impressive covers of tracks like “Money, Money, Money,” “SOS” and — most iconic of them all — “Dancing Queen.” When combined with eloquent dancing sequences, the show achieves a sense of idyllicism, which was what made “Mamma Mia!” so popular among millennials in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although all the actors impress, third-year feminist studies major Kat Bautista deserves special mention on her own. Her portrayal of the wide-eyed, idealistic Sophie is superb. Bautista’s voice is simply beautiful, giving me chills as she sang “Honey, Honey” in the opening act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is quite the sight to see Sophie twirling through the island of Kalokairi in search of her father and to see the apprehension in Sophie’s mother, Donna, as she collides with her former love interests. Arguably, one of the best things about “Mamma Mia!” is that its plot is so fantastical in nature that the audience cannot help but wish it to be true.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shrunken Heads Production Company will be holding auditions for its next musical, “Xanadu,” from Feb. 19 to Feb. 23. While the original production of “Xanadu” was poorly received (receiving a 25% critic rating on </span><a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/xanadu\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rotten Tomatoes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), the upcoming musical lends a lot of creative direction to the Shrunken Heads crew, who will be taking a sharp turn from the whimsical “Mamma Mia!” production. Students who are interested in the “Xanadu” production may schedule a time slot for vocal and dance auditions on the Shrunken Heads </span><a href=\"http://shrunkenheadsproductions.com/auditions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Effectively, this would render the Aristotle/Plato debate irrelevant, and that’s what VR promoters like Scharf and the growing legion of VR techies and enthusiasts around the world believe: In the future, VR will regularly deliver such experiences and even become part of life.</p>\n<p>While only time can tell if they were right, the new, immersive experience is undeniably exciting with its promising and impactful social premise.</p>\n<p><strong>Cultural Acceptance, Immersive Experience</strong></p>\n<p>VR has long existed as simply a concept, and it wasn’t until 1968 that we saw the first primitive VR device (with the ominous name, “The Sword of Damocles”), created by computer scientist Ivan Sutherland. In the ensuing years, other early VR inventions were developed, and the vision began to seep deeper into our culture through science fiction novels (e.g. Philip K. Dick’s We Can Remember It For You Wholesale and William Gibson’s Neuromancer), Hollywood films (“TRON” and “The Matrix”) and TV shows (“The Twilight Zone” and “Star Trek”).</p>\n<p>These media instilled in the public a fascination with VR, but there was still a big gap between the idea and the actual experience.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to the 21st century. Both newly inaugurated conventions such as Silicon Valley Comic Con (SVCC) and established expos like VRLA are on a mission to showcase how divides are being erased, both between virtual and physical spaces and between the hands of developers and those of everyday audiences.</p>\n<p>At VRLA, consumers and industry professionals alike marveled at 360-degree domes, cut a rug at the first-ever VR rave and experienced various other immersive simulations from 133 exhibitors like HTC Vive, Sixense and Vanishing Point Media.</p>\n<p>VRLA explored how cardboard boxes could transport people into worlds new and old through Unofficial Cardboard. It addressed how to add a tactile touch to the virtual experience by using SubPac to physically feel music and sounds pulsating through the body. The con also revealed how one person can seamlessly be their own production studio and create and share VR experiences through Mindshow.</p>\n<p>There were experiences with dinosaurs to run from, castles to defend and painful memories to suppress.</p>\n<p>Beyond these entertainment experiences, VR has also been used for simulations to help design factories, train soldiers and astronauts, help athletes improve their techniques and even guide surgeons through complicated procedures.</p>\n<p>Thus, to become a seamless part of everyday life, like cell phones and Facebook, seems like an obvious next step.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparing the Systems</strong></p>\n<p>Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, who spent $2 billion to acquire Oculus Rift (which just launched its first generation of headsets to the public in March), wants to enhance social media, gaming, online education and sporting events with VR technologies to produce a richer immersive experience for Facebook’s billions of users. And that’s just a small part of Zuckerberg’s vision for VR potentials, according to his statement.</p>\n<p>Recognizing its future potential, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Stan Lee, comic creator and former Marvel Comics chairman, teamed up to debut the first-ever SVCC in March this year. The convention brought together more than 60,000 comic fans, VR technologists and game developers to promote the convergence of entertainment and technology.</p>\n<p>“Virtual reality: It’s like an artificial world that feels and seems real,” Wozniak said in an interview with TechCrunch. “And that’s what comic books and movies are all about.”</p>\n<p>Between SVCC’s blending of entertainment and technology and VRLA’s vision of VR applications in multiple facets of society, these potentials don’t seem to be far off from Ernest Cline’s projections in his best-selling novel, <em>Ready Player One</em>. According to Cline’s novel, 2044 will enjoy a takeover by Oasis, a virtual universe housing thousands of different virtual worlds, through which colossal numbers of people can compete against one another in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) or participate in all kinds of activities like shopping, socializing and even dinning at favorite restaurants just like in the real world.</p>\n<p>Cline’s fiction might not be too farfetched; MMORPGs have long been a reality with games, like World of Warcraft (released in 2004), which have millions of players worldwide online 24/7. Hence, a virtual universe like Oasis could conceivably begin to take shape once the VR ecosystem becomes more mature.</p>\n<p><strong>Player One Ready</strong></p>\n<p>In “The Matrix,” arguably the ultimate virtual reality film, Judas figure Cypher admits his sin of delivering rebellion leader Morpheus to the all-powerful Machines’ avatar, Agent Smith, stating, “You know, I know this steak doesn’t exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize?”</p>\n<p>He takes a bite of the steak before declaring his guilt.</p>\n<p>“Ignorance is bliss.”</p>\n<p>If Zuckerberg, Wozniak and Scharf are right, we might see VR experiences become as common as online video chatting and VR devices as ubiquitous as video game consoles or computer tablets in households. For now, VR is definitely a guilty pleasure more and more people are ready to embrace.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72312\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/a-new-future-unveiled-at-virtual-reality-cons/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72312\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/a-new-future-unveiled-at-virtual-reality-cons/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/a-new-future-unveiled-at-virtual-reality-cons/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/a-new-future-unveiled-at-virtual-reality-cons/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/a-new-future-unveiled-at-virtual-reality-cons/","id":6524,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6523,6522,6521],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
