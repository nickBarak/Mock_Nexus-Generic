UCPD works alongside IVFP to represent the university’s interest in matters of law and safety in I.V. while also patrolling the approximately 1,000 acres of UCSB’s campus, maintaining 24-hour uniformed patrol and police response.</p>\n<p>IVFP Sergeant Daniel Calderon said UCPD officers and IVFP deputies have similar duties and often rotate roles.</p>\n<p>“We all have the same peace officers powers of the state,” Calderon said. “It is just that those officers that are assigned to the campus only work on the campus during that time period. Isla Vista, this particular community, is an unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County, so [IVFP] handles all of the emergency calls for service.”</p>\n<p>There are currently seven officers from UCPD both patrolling campus and working in I.V. alongside IVFP, according to UCPD Sergeant Robert Romero.</p>\n<p>“That is on a rotational basis, so once every year and a half, two years, an officer will leave the campus patrol station and go work eight months to a year out at Isla Vista,” Romero said. “They are the ones that are really the heart and soul of the department.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP responds to crimes such as burglary, theft, battery and assault, but not traffic accidents, which fall under the California Highway Patrol’s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>“We don’t handle the traffic enforcement out here — that is still Highway Patrol — they’re still responsible for handling traffic accident investigations, things like that,” Calderon said. “But we can still pull people over — issue citations for speeding, stop signs we can still make arrests for drunk driving and things like that — it is just that that is not necessarily our primary duty.”</p>\n<p>UCPD’s campus jurisdiction includes lecture halls and university housing in I.V., according to Calderon.</p>\n<p>“All of the buildings that they own that surround Isla Vista, all of the student housing, the faculty housing and [family] student housing, all of the new construction projects that you see — that is all UC property,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Romero said UCPD hosts safety presentations for students, especially those living in residence halls, and collaborates with them on solutions to solve public safety issues.</p>\n<p>“We go to different functions that residential life might be putting on,” Romero said. “These interactions we have with students is, basically, we talk to them about things on how to be safe and they talk to us about what they like, what they don’t like from their police department. So it is an exchange of ideas and how to come up with a better plan on how to keep the community safe.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said any student or I.V. resident can join IVFP deputies on a walk-along to experience a day in the life of an officer.</p>\n<p>“From a UCSB student’s perspective, there is just a bunch of cops walking around. Do you know what they are doing?” Calderon said. “That is why I encourage people to do walk-alongs so they can kind of see and point out the problems that we try to tell people about.”</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, IVFP deputies are trained to use “tactical communication” skills when dealing with “chaotic” scenarios.</p>\n<p>“Let’s say I’m working Del Playa on a Saturday night. It’s really busy and if I went into a party or I went into a fight and people are yelling and it’s a very chaotic, rapidly evolving scene, it is not going to benefit me and it’s not going to benefit my partners if I go in there and start yelling at people,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Romero said newly hired UCPD officers undergo field training alongside an experienced officer.</p>\n<p>“When they get hired they are on a field training program,” Romero said. “Besides learning how to do a proper car stop, how to search somebody properly, how to place somebody into custody, we also teach them how to interact with our community, things to look for, how to be an active listener.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP intervenes when necessary to keep students and I.V. residents safe.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to make sure that everybody enjoys their time here out in Isla Vista and we know that they are away from home and a lot of people are away from home for the first time,” Calderon said. “It is not our greatest goal just to write people tickets for open containers of alcohol.”</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, deputies prosecute people for wrong-doings to prevent them from repeatedly acting out.</p>\n<p>“We try to prosecute that person because what we found is that when people do that to somebody — when they harm them physically, sexually assault them, that kind of thing — that almost empowers them to where they think that they can do it again and keep doing it in our community,” Calderon said. “That is why we have these people who are repeat offenders.”</p>\n<p>Romero said UCPD looks to hire officers who are community oriented.</p>\n<p>“We try to hire people here at the police department that are customer service oriented, community oriented. And when we are doing the hiring process, even some of the interview questions for getting a job here at the police department, we ask them about how do you feel about community-organized policing, can you define it for us, what does it mean to you?” Romero said.</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP seeks to hire “mature” and experienced individuals as deputies.</p>\n<p>“I started this business when I was little bit older, I had already had another career completely. I started this in 2002; I came on board with the Sheriff’s office but I had already done some other things,” Calderon said. “Essentially we want to make sure that the officers and deputies assigned here are mature.”</p>\n<p>Romero said Community Service Organization (CSO) student officers also work alongside UCPD and help with campus security, patrolling campus buildings, sports games and entertainment events.</p>\n<p>“They do a fabulous job of going into the community, because their peers are the students,” Romero said. “They also are an extra pair of eyes and ears for any trouble that is going on in the university campus or Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Romero said the number of officers at the UCPD station, which includes an investigation unit and dispatch center, will likely soon increase.</p>\n<p>“Currently we have 36 sworn police officers, however, that number is going to grow probably another 10 here in the near future,” Romero said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Mable Truong said she did not know the difference between IVFP and UCPD, and previously was not aware of the CSO program.</p>\n<p>“I would be one of the people that are confused,” Truong said. “I think I have an idea of what they do — they are the people that bring you around at night … then I just saw them last night so I thought that was really cool, and they seem really friendly, too.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Elizabeth Del Rincon said she feels safer on campus and in I.V. with a visible police presence.</p>\n<p>“Just if something bad were to happen, I feel like they would be there to go and help,” Del Rincon said.</p>\n<p>Del Rincon said she believes it is important for officers to receive training on how to work with students.</p>\n<p>“They are around students all the time so I feel like if they were to receive training it would be better,” Del Rincon said. “I see them especially at night escorting people to their dorms and stuff and I think that is really good.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Jill Allen said the CSO escort program is helpful and allows students to feel safer.</p>\n<p>“It makes you feel safer trying to walk from one end, especially to walk from the Chem building to I.V. in the dark. It’s not so fun,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, UCPD and IVFP work together without overstepping boundaries.</p>\n<p>“It is two different jurisdictions, but in other words, we work very closely. We don’t step on each other’s toes,” Calderon said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/","id":4629,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4628,4627,4626],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman","biography":"Not available","articles":[2407,2490,2504,2533,2541,2543,2544,2551,2557,2580,2616,2618,2688,2702,2703,2728,2737,2749,2778,2780,2792,2802,2803,2825,2846,2855,2860,2881,2885,2899,2900,2904,2908,2913,2920,2934,2943,2945,2946,2962,2970,2977,3443,3609,3617,3856,4590,4606,4626,4629,4656,4722,4741,4786,4801,4813],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Board Considers Solution to I.V.

The IVMP mandates regular street parking surveys and stipulates that if the survey finds a parking vacancy rate below 15 percent for three consecutive UCSB academic quarters, the county will implement a permit parking program to bring parking vacancy rates back above the 15 percent mark. Many I.V. residents take issue with the 2013 survey findings, claiming I.V. parking is more impacted than the survey suggested and requires a more immediate solution. The Commission ultimately voted to recommend IVMP’s existing decision to continue surveys before implementing a permit program.</p>\n<p>Deputy Director of Long Range Planning Division Matt Schneider said parking surveys, conducted by Fehr and Peers Transportation Consultants, help monitor parking vacancy rates.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The purpose of the parking survey … is to monitor the vacancy rate, with 15 percent vacancy rate being the tipping point,” Schneider said. “Based on the current data we have available, we are below that threshold. There certainly will be a need once we cross that to develop a more robust parking program.”</p>\n<p>Planning Commission member Daniel Blough said a parking survey is not necessary, as parking in I.V. is clearly impacted.</p>\n<p>“On that one issue I just can’t see wasting the money or the time,” Blough said. “I don’t need a survey to tell me there is a problem.”</p>\n<p>Planning Commission member Joan Hartmann said parking surveys should monitor parking until results “trigger” a program.</p>\n<p>“It may be that we already have a strong sense that there is not enough parking, that it has already met the trigger since that survey was done in 2013, but I think we need ongoing surveys to see if there is change,” Hartmann said. “It is mrely a monitoring program and if we have other strategies to deal with parking, then we would like to see those changes on the ground.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said UCSB faculty and staff parking may be impacting I.V. due to insufficient on-campus parking, meaning improved UCSB parking could help I.V.</p>\n<p>“Maybe there are other things in addition to the parking permit program that we can be working on,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees member and UCSB alum Jonathan Abboud said I.V. should have a way to locally oversee the proposed permit program.<br>\n“I personally would support moving the plan forward now, but we should have an Area Planning Commission in Isla Vista in the future to oversee the implementation of the plan to make it more community-reflective and more community-based,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students College of Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said I.V. needs an effective parking solution because many students depend on cars for transportation.</p>\n<p>“Oftentimes, it is dismissed that students need cars, but oftentimes it is very vital that they have them, so adequate parking really needs to be considered,” Minoiefar said. “The landlords’ use of high parking fees for their parking spots is an issue.”</p>\n<p>The Commission will send its recommendations to the Board of Supervisors, which will consider the revised IVMP this winter. If the Board adopts the updates, it will submit the IVMP to the California Coastal Commission in Santa Barbara County in Spring 2016.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the

Vista residents have begun campaigning for office in a college town on the brink of self-governance.</p>\n<p>Ethan Bertrand, Spencer Brandt, Jay Freeman, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Natalie Jordan are the first to announce candidacy for the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/10-questions-about-isla-vista-self-governance\" target=\"_blank\">I.V. Community Service District</a> (CSD) board of supervisors, which will be put to a vote in November.</p>\n<p>The CSD is a proposed form of local government in I.V. with the ability to improve infrastructure, institute community policing and mediate between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>It will appear as Measure E on the November ballot and require a majority vote to pass. All candidates running for office as the board of directors will be listed on the ballot, along with a tax designed to partially fund the CSD.</p>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), which outlines specific powers for the I.V. CSD, states that the board of directors will have seven members — five directors elected at large, one director appointed by the county and one director appointed by UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang.</p>\n<p>Of the five elected board members, four directors must serve four-year terms and one director serves a two-year term. For the inaugural election in November, two four-year positions have been swapped for temporary two-year candidates.</p>\n<p>Freeman, who was the first to file for candidacy, is the founder of software company Cydia and a 16-year I.V. resident. He joined the race shortly after an unsuccessful run for Santa Barbara County Supervisor in June. He and Brandt are currently unopposed as the only candidates vying for the two four-year positions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64710\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"614444030\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72077\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64710\" data-attachment-id=\"64710\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/ab3_by-eric-swenson-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=1213%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1213,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB3_by Eric Swenson-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64710\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Freeman speaks at an Isla Vista stakeholders meeting in September.

He is running for the director position because he “got drafted” by other community members, he said.</p>\n<p>“I responded favorably to that because I believe in what is being done with the Community Services District,” he said. After living in I.V. for 48 years, he said he has been in a “unique position” to have observed and been “right in the middle of” much of I.V. history.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time I have heard a strategy that really moves this community forward toward identity and a voice,” he said. “It may not have been time for [the CSD] decades ago, but it is time now.”</p>\n<p>The four new candidates will be officially registered with the county elections office after finishing paperwork due August 12, according to Hector Gonzalez-Loera, the Santa Barbara County elections supervisor.

The county’s deadline to add or remove names on the ballot was Aug. 12.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Ruiz suspending his campaign, Bertrand said he will now focus more on other candidates and measures: Salud Carbajal for Congress, Joan Hartmann for Supervisor and Yes on Measures E &amp; F. He will also be promoting his CSD “running mates” Natalie Jordan, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges and Spencer Brandt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand said he commends Ruiz for his “interest in improving Isla Vista” and will continue to advocate for the Latino community as Ruiz did.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have and I will continue to be a voice for those segments of the community, especially for those who are underserved and underrepresented,” Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he does not yet want to throw his support behind any specific candidate, Ruiz said he is “happy” for Bertrand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m sure he’ll do fine,” Ruiz said. “Hopefully he serves the community and has its best interests at heart.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates for the temporary two-year positions still face active competition. Jordan, Hedges, Michael Kile and Andrew Gabriel Pragin oppose each other for the two seats, although Jordan and Hedges consider each other running mates.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Measure F, a utility users tax, is needed along with Measure E to provide services in Isla Vista.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72343\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/joel-ruiz-suspends-candidacy-for-i-v-csd-board-of-directors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72343\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/joel-ruiz-suspends-candidacy-for-i-v-csd-board-of-directors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/joel-ruiz-suspends-candidacy-for-i-v-csd-board-of-directors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/joel-ruiz-suspends-candidacy-for-i-v-csd-board-of-directors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-29/joel-ruiz-suspends-candidacy-for-i-v-csd-board-of-directors/","id":4628,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4627,4626,4625],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
