Martin Bresso, more distinctively known as Tchami, is a French DJ and has worked in collaboration with many notable musicians, including AlunaGeorge, DJ Snake and Jack Ü.</p>\n<p>A music career birthed only four years ago has sprouted into a genre of its own, commonly known as future house music. House music aficionado and philosophy major Jessica O’Brien has an apprehensive outlook on future house:</p>\n<p>“Although some future house songs, especially Tchami’s ‘Shot Caller’ are enjoyable to dance to, the genre doesn’t seem to do much for a deep-house frequenter,” she commented. “The bubblegummy lyrics and quick transition from build-up to drop defeats what’s most interesting about a house song. In my opinion, future house, while being fun, simply feeds the listener shallow lyrics and exciting drops as opposed to creating an entirely consuming house experience.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Future house is an electronic dance music (EDM) genre that incorporates a fusion of EDM and deep house music. In an interview with “THUMP,” Tchami stated that “house music in general is full of mature-minded artists who understand the culture,” and he counts on them to take the genre to the next level with him.</p>\n<p>Delirium originated three years ago as a university-hosted event to evade unruly Halloweekend crowds, around the pickup of Tchami’s music career. Some freshmen were taken aback by the severity of enforcements this Halloweekend. First-year communication major Neela Nassiri was incredibly “disappointed that nothing would be going on Halloween weekend” but was “satisfied because [she had] something to do.” She reports that her friend saw Tchami at Hard Summer 2017 and came back with “raving” reviews, which raised her excitement level for the artist. Though Nassiri has never been to an EDM concert before, she is excited to see her favorite Tchami song, “After Life,” live and be in an environment full of UCSB students.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79571\" style=\"width: 1044px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1398504913\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79570\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79571\" data-attachment-id=\"79571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-08/tchami-takes-on-delirium-2017-with-surging-tracks/unnamed-1-16/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=1034%2C813&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1034,813\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=250%2C197&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=888%2C698&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79571\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=888%2C698\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"698\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?w=1034&amp;ssl=1 1034w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=250%2C197&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=768%2C604&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C805&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79571\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>At 8:45 p.m., the Thunderdome had renovated itself into a laser light show, brimming with color and the sweet sounding trap music of recent UCSB alumnus Underbelly’s set. By 9:20, a big crowd had already formed as students danced rambunctiously to the pre-recorded music. The moshing had already set its course long before Tchami appeared.</p>\n<p>Not too long after 9:30, Morpei, donning a blinding white T-shirt, arrived on stage and immediately amplified the bass. Along with a crowd of students and friends, I formed beat-matching mosh pit after mosh pit, expanding at the build-up and growing at every drop. After a few successfully energetic songs, the DJ ended his set, leaving the crowd sweaty but nonetheless eager for Tchami.</p>\n<p>Cheers from the audience roared vivaciously as Tchami began bumping his initial beats shortly before 11 p.m. A pulsating blue light rhythmically flashed behind the DJ, navigating its way through the depths of the crowd. At this point, everyone was reveling in the sensational sound and the moshing was well underway. I suffered from a few jabs to the jaw as well as soft punches to the head in the rowdy mosh, but it was nothing I couldn’t shake right off to continue dancing.</p>\n<p>Long-time Tchami fan and biology major Ivan Gonzalez most thoroughly enjoyed the song “Afterlife”; he said that was “one of the first songs [he’d] heard” from Tchami and that hearing that song again reminded him of the same performance at Hard Summer, two years back.</p>\n<p>The crowd reacted positively at the turn of each song, indicating familiarity and appreciation for the artist. Even concert-goers at the far end of the stage were rejoicing in the music and dancing just as hard, if not harder, than those in the front. The energy soared consistently throughout the event. Tchami ended his performance with his most popular song, “Adieu,” which incited immense bliss from the crowd.</p>\n<p>To some, Tchami may seem like a run-of-the-mill EDM DJ, but to second-year film studies major Sydney Henrikson, Tchami holds deep sentimental value. She was “so stoked” to see Tchami live, since she has been listening to his music for over a year. In fact, as unbelievable of a combination as it sounds, she danced to Tchami on her first date with her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>Tchami’s sentiment does not end there. Candace McKeag, a second-year statistics major, said that Tchami is by far her favorite EDM artist. She has been listening to Tchami since 2013, when his first EP came out, and even met her boyfriend at a Tchami concert. “Turn Down for What,” a song that Tchami co-wrote with DJ Snake, ranks among one of Candace’s favorites. Candace hopes her boyfriend will propose to her at an upcoming Tchami event.</p>\n<p>At the event, I also spoke with second-year geology major Thomas Crimmel, who said that he was “most excited to dance with everyone around [him].” Crimmel had a sagacious insight on the entirety of the event: “An entire university and a single artist under a single roof is really something special.” If Thomas could sum up his excitement for Tchami in one phrase, he would simply scream “Tchami!” As I looked at the crowd at Delirium, I noticed that what Thomas said reigned true — smiles from a majority of the students beamed graciously in appreciation of EDM music.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a113bd550235af7443413e389317dbd?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kjwd/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Melody Pezeshkian</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melody Pezeshkian first reported for News where she covered protests, rallies, and campus productions.

This is the 23-year-old’s second album under the King Krule moniker, the first being <em>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</em>, which made waves in 2013 with its eclectic and precociously distinct sound and gained the attention and adoration of such famed artists as Beyoncé and Frank Ocean. But it seems Marshall wants to do some exploring while he’s still young; find himself; rebel a little. What sprung from his unsettled soul was an exercise in bipolar lunacy.</p>\n<p>Throughout the new project, the singer/songwriter/musician/producer whirls from lo-fi to hi-fi, across a spectrum of tempos and from sedated to agitated states in a manner that would be dizzying if it weren’t so seamless. There’s a balance to Marshall’s madness. He expands on the smooth moodiness of <em>6 Feet</em>, but his punk influences enjoy much more air time here. His vocal adaptations to these rougher, more addled sounds are even more compelling.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As some of the best things in life, Marshall’s voice is somewhat of an acquired taste. Its abundant richness can be overwhelming to the unaccustomed listener, but the low register and thick South London accent in which he sings provide a rawness much needed in an age when overproduction often sucks the life out of the human voice. King Krule’s music, on the other hand, comes from underneath you, and on this album takes you underwater. This is violently true on the album’s punkier cuts. The restless, distorted guitar riffs on songs like “Dum Surfer” and “Emergency Blimp” do well to complement Marshall’s deep and untethering vocals as they come to an aggravated boil. An echoing, bass-heavy symphony of waves crashes overhead. These songs have you bobbing your whole body and rattling inside it.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say Marshall can’t deliver a fantastic slow jam. On the wistfully declarative title track and the down-tempo, syncopated grooves of “Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver),” he fishes a jazzy melancholy from the depths of his soul. Tracks like these are the most personal on the album — and beautifully so. Between the latter’s soft weep of guitar chords comes the sobering and pensive reflection, “Why’d you leave me because of my depression? / You used to complete me, but I guess I learned a lesson.” Marshall exhibits a talent for loading and springing coils of emotion in the span of a couple lyrics. On countless occasions, he offers the uncanny prose of the troubled, disaffected mind. The barking refrain of “Slush Puppy,” “Nothin’ is workin’ with me,” bears the artist’s mounting frustration as it floats into the ether, dissipates and surrounds you. To resist absorbing it is thoroughly difficult. Marshall’s thoughts entice you into embracing them as your own, no matter how malignant they announce themselves to be. They wash over you, but they also wash beneath you, through you and within you.</p>\n<p><em>The OOZ</em> is a different atmosphere. Marshall plays the navigator of its deep, dark depths. In this collage of genres and influences, boundaries dissolve. King Krule creates a musical space totally new and unknown, where the recesses of the subconscious manifest as part of the landscape. <em>The OOZ</em> inhabits those late-night hours when the demons of the mind and city slink about. The freedom is theirs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2HRzIyyXvU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tia Rotolo: British singer Archy Marshall — better known as King Krule — returns to music, but not humanity, with the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OOZ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Friday, Oct. 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From its induction up until its final note, Marshall’s latest LP is in motion as a distorted expenditure through time and space, abandoning glorifications of permanence. With brutally honest imagery, King Krule wrestles with human emotions, despite making every effort to resent humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album begins slowly with “Biscuit Town.” Airy guitar riffs and static resemble a train moving over tracks. It’s familiar, but there’s something off about it. The track opens, “I seem to sink lower.” His deep, looming vocals immediately capture the listener in a firm grip juxtaposed with the delicate notes of the guitar. The song drops to a beat with every final note in the line lingering for slightly too long, evoking a discomfort that intrigues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there’s one thing King Krule has mastered, it’s creating something so eerie, so vile yet so addictive. His sound represents a sketchy alleyway at midnight: Even though we know better, we want to see what lies beyond. Howling chilling sounds, he challenges his audience to stay with him against all notions of common sense.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He presents his listener with one question: Where do we go when we don’t fit in anywhere? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His answer lies in a vast unknown, deep oceans and outer space. Both are odes to his previous albums and can be haunting to the average person, but he finds solace in them nonetheless. He’s lost and alone. His only places of belonging are where no one does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A town alarm warns listeners of the commencement of the song, “Sublunary.” In an auto-tuned alien-like voice, King Krule talks of being “made for sublunary,” a reference to an earlier King Krule record, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 Feet Beneath the Moon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here, there are no physics, no humanity, and no emotions; This is where he belongs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sad as the album’s premise is, it doesn’t ask for sympathy. For each melodramatic line, Marshall presents a grotesque image of vomit or mutation, as done in “Lonely Blue.” He is not romantic; he is disgusting and vulgar, but also potent and unapologetic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Like a lullaby, “Czech One” emulates a dream state. The song masters the feeling of wanting to fall asleep but being wide awake. Struggling with insomnia, the artist wrestles with the thought of the woman he can’t forget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She still sits in my dreams,” he sings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He can’t escape her. Driven to insanity, Marshall and his listeners are invited to mourn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly every line is short and abrupt. This element of disjointment imitates a stream of consciousness, jumping from one thought to the next. What stitches each line together are the instrumentals, mediating the words to comprehension while sustaining the chaos of Marshall’s psyche.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “Bermondsey Bosom (Right),” his father talks to the listener delicately over oriental sounds. He references Marshall’s previous albums, speaking as someone who knows him, but may not fully understand him. He’s unable to accept people and finds difficulty in distinguishing “paradise” and “parasites.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “Half Man Half Shark,” the singer’s lack of humanity transitions into animalia. He distinguishes himself from others as empty and losing meaning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See world, you’ll never know/At least when you look to the stars they still glow/Well, not for me though</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” he sings, confirming that he’s the only one who can truly understand his own state of mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subtly drifting to a new dimension, the artist takes his listener to “The Cadet Leaps.”  With piano and static, he creates his own atmosphere. He’s lost but surrounded, gazing on humanity from a higher standpoint, watching the parasites and paradise get twisted in their own misconceptions. The listener discovers that the mysterious woman understood his condition and could transcend above humanity with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The title track begins with a woman speaking, “Its motion, it’s urgent, its trigger.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">King Krule in the background asks, “Is there anybody out there?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The song is oozing with something unrefined. Pleas from Marshall include, “Could we align?” He’s desperate for human connection, but with someone who can understand. Melancholy and intricate, he is giving into companionship, slowly drifting back to a human place. “It’s cold by the fire,” he repeats again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The album evens out with its closing track, “La Lune,” which uses elements of bass and guitar most resembling his earlier works. In addition to rain drizzling in the background and lighters being lit, he analyzes the human process of becoming the people we fall in love with, saying, “It won’t be long … / Till you’re inside my heart.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this song, as with much of the album, Marshall takes his listener to a familiar place of consciousness, but it’s a place that most people don’t wish to return to if they don’t have to. This is a place of darkness, where light isn’t known by its presence but solely by one’s belief in it. As a physical place, this state of mind can be related to the ocean and space, tying the themes of the album together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of leaving the disturbing mental state, King Krule soaks in its discomfort. In creating his home here, he can no longer be a human being, but instead becomes some adjunct of the universe. Yet, he still wrestles with human needs, as he wishes to be “Elevated with you.” The guitar riffs and static even out and eventually the listener is left alone in silence as the album ends simply and modestly. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OOZ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is depressive, sometimes manic, but always unforgiving. King Krule does not wish to evoke sympathy or some romanticized images of the depression which ails him. He’s basking in the originality and repugnance of his suffering. He’s full of guilt and regret, but he’s recognized the value of these emotions. Attempting to find his position in time and space, he wrestles with what we know and what we’ve yet to truly understand about the human condition. There are no false idealizations of a physical home, but merely a presentation of a mental state worth diving into.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79201\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79201\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-27/the-friday-review-the-ooz-by-king-krule/","id":6679,"author":{"id":361,"name":"Konrad Neithercutt"},"related":[6678,6677,6676],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"7 Spooky Songs for Your Halloween Playlist","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/halloween1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/halloween1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Hopefully, these creepy selections can help you get in a festive mood as you prepare for the spookiest night of the year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halloween is here, bringing with it cravings for candy, horror films and, of course, spooky tunes. Sure, everyone has heard songs like “Monster Mash” and “Spooky Scary Skeletons,” and anyone who hasn’t listened to “Thriller” at least once in their lifetime has most likely been living under a rock for the past 30 years. This is a list featuring seven spooky songs you may not have heard before — or, if you have, maybe you never thought to listen to them on Halloween: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Walking On Air” by Kerli</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With its soft trilling notes and eerie imagery, this song has an undeniably creepy air to it. While the chorus is surprisingly catchy and upbeat, the song still manages to maintain an overall ghostly tone throughout, making it perfect for a Halloween playlist. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXMeZwO2qZ0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Creepy Doll” by Jonathan Coulton</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Jonathan Coulton is perhaps better known for writing songs featured in video games (such as “Still Alive” from Portal), but he has written stand-alone songs as well. Most of his songs (if not all of them) seem a little offbeat, but “Creepy Doll” takes the cake when it comes to spooky tunes. His lyrics, set against a chilling melody, tell an unsettling horror story as if you’re the one living it, making it a great choice if you want to curl up in bed with your headphones on a gloomy autumn night. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiEarqIBsdg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Stop, I’m Already Dead” by Deadboy and the Elephantmen</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There’s not much more to this song than a competent electric guitar and the lyrics “I am already dead” and yet, that’s all it really needs. This is a melody that manages to be morbid but fun at the same time. You can enjoy the song year-round, but with its death-centric title and chorus, it feels especially appropriate for Halloween </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E73IQx21DEo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Bloody Mary” by Lady Gaga: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an alias like Mother Monster, it should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga came up with some spooky songs of her own. The way she screams between verses and the way her voice becomes distorted during certain lines gives “Bloody Mary” a disturbing resonance. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFwmKL5OL-Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“King” by The Romanovs</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: “King” is a siren’s song, telling the tale of a woman who lures men to their death. The melody is accompanied by a haunting harmony, and the song’s steady lilt overall proves beautiful yet macabre, a good fit for a grim holiday. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P911lpDWjp8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Seven Devils” by Florence + the</b> <b>Machine</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: With lines like “I was dead when I woke up this morning” and “I’ll be dead before the day is done,” this song is undoubtedly chilling. Its slow, dramatic melody adds to the grim mood, as the lyrics paint a picture of someone being hunted down relentlessly. This song may not be the best at parties, but it’s an appropriately dark tune to listen to if you’re putting the finishing touches on your costume or carving a big smile into a pumpkin. </span></span><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QdpCJIyyi4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>“Dead Fast Rap” by Boyinaband</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This fast-paced rap is short, sweet and to the point, as it finds as many ways as possible to use the word “dead” in under two minutes.
