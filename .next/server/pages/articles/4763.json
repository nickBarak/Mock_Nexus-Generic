Clinic for the weekly shareholder’s meeting. Tuesday night’s meeting focused on the issue of amending CA AB-3 to include a specific governance plan for I.V. self-governance. <em>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista community members met Tuesday night for the weekly stakeholders meeting, held by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office, last night at the I.V. Clinic on 970 Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>Attendees strategized ways to get more input from residents regarding current and prior self-governance discussions and deliberated the May 15 deadline for an amended AB3 bill to include legal language addressing the need for self-governance in I.V. Currently AB3, introduced into the assembly by Williams, cannot be voted upon because it lacks explicit directions for the way I.V. will to be governed.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) board member and longtime resident Pegeen Soutar said the approaching deadline to provide specific legal language in a month is unrealistic and “overwhelming.”</p>\n<p>“I am really uncomfortable trying to come up with something in one month,” Soutar said. “It is hard for us to get our heads around and I can’t even imagine the general public who have not been sitting in on these meetings. I don’t think we have all the facts yet. The idea of having something tangible by May is overwhelming to me.”</p>\n<p>Local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman said he was disappointed in the turnout at the town hall, due to both the low attendance number and lack of older community members.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised at how few people came. At previous town hall meetings a very large number of people have come,” Freeman said. “The previous town halls had a lot of older people, and at this meeting there were very few older people, it was almost all students. I was really surprised at the massive change.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, residents should be informed of the discussion topics before the meeting for future town halls.</p>\n<p>“It might have been really interesting to have had in the documentation that was sent out specifying what kind of things were going to be talked about, one of which being a community center,” Freeman said. “Because then people might have thought, ‘Oh, that’s a thing I care about.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60712\" style=\"width: 352px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60712\" data-attachment-id=\"60712\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/isla-vista-stakeholders-meeting-02102015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=4928%2C3264&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4928,3264\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting 02\\/10\\/2015.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423565074\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0666666666667\",\"title\":\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting 02\\/10\\/2015.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Isla Vista Stakeholders Meeting Das Williams\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60712\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=342%2C226\" alt=\"Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus\" width=\"342\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Stakeholder-Meeting-Das-Williams_Sam-Aragon-1.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60712\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I.V. community members listen at Tuesday night’s stakeholders meeting. <i>Sam Aragon/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Attendees at Tuesday’s meeting discussed how to better understand the needs of the community, particularly those of long-term renters and Latino families. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk said Associated Students provides an I.V. Survey to gauge community opinions.</p>\n<p>“There’s an Associated Students in Isla Vista survey that deals directly with which services people would like to see,” Schunk said. “If we’re talking about biases and skewing results there is a large possibility that it is skewed because the survey is from the perspective of the student asking what services Associated Students can provide.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the EVPLA office is attempting to take into account the sentiments of Latino families and community members in addition to students in the self-governance process.</p>\n<p>“That survey obviously is limited in scope, but that outreach is largely from my office targeting Latino families and community members and so we’re trying to wrap that into this outreach,” Schunk said. “That’s a slow-going process, a lot of what we’re encountering is a lack of trust amongst community members in Associated Students, which has been around for a long, long time. We’re working to alleviate that.”</p>\n<p>Community organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said a professional firm will conduct a new fiscal study to better illuminate if and how I.V. could raise revenue to address community needs.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing a financial feasibility study by a professional firm,” Elliott said. “That’s going to give us a lot of the hard numbers, so these conversations are mostly educational and starting to get feedback and peoples’ general thoughts on it but obviously when we get those hard numbers that’s what’s going to mean the most.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould said determining which services are needed in I.V. and how to pay for those services are an integral component of the self-government process.</p>\n<p>“That’s the critical thing in this whole process — finding out what services are lacking and how much is being spent at the level they’re at,” Gould said, “Where do we want that level to be and how much more is that going to take. Put a price tag on each one of those services, figure out what we want as a community and then pick and choose the services we’re going to spend our money on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-11/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-tackles-amending-assembly-bill-3/","id":4763,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4762,4761,4760],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"First Place Gauchos Look to Build Separation Against Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A strong showing this weekend could help No. 6 UCSB take control atop the Big West","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63188\" style=\"width: 682px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/vs-CSUB-5-5-15-1-print.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1483586098\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63131\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63188\" data-attachment-id=\"63188\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/first-place-gauchos-look-to-build-separation-against-fullerton/domenic-mazza-throws-a-pitch-jose-ochoadaily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/vs-CSUB-5-5-15-1-print.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5184,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T3i\",\"caption\":\"Domenic Mazza throws a pitch.

[CSUF is] starting to play well and we’ve played well,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We have a battle in front of us, and it’ll be competitive. It’ll be a hostile crowd and all of that. It should be fun; that’s why we play college baseball.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho pitching staff will show its normal rotation including appearances from its three usual weekend starters. Junior righty Dillon Tate enters this weekend’s start on the road with a 1.63 earned run average, which sets him second in overall conference ERA. In Tate’s seven wins this season, he has struck out 84 opposing batters.</p>\n<p>Junior lefty Justin Jacome also stands alongside Tate among the conference leaders. Jacome yields the seventh best ERA in the conference at 2.24, and in his seven wins he has struck out 75 batters. The only sophomore of the starting core, righty Shane Bieber, also tops league standings. Bieber ranks fifth among ERA leaders hurling a 2.01 ERA and with six wins under his belt, has struck out 74.</p>\n<p>All of the four Gaucho starters, including Tuesday starter junior lefty Domenic Mazza, are pitching for under a 2.50 ERA. UCSB collectively holds a NCAA-best 2.07 ERA.</p>\n<p>“I always feel good about our starting pitching and know that they’ll give us a chance,” Checketts said. “There’s always a shot that they’ll blow up and have a bad start, but we haven’t had a lot of those, so I feel pretty good about our chances.”</p>\n<p>Gaucho offensive leader senior outfielder Cameron Newell did not start on Tuesday against Bakersfield, nor did junior utility player and right-handed pitcher Robby Nesovic. Nesovic has been unable to play due to a reported injured hand, but looks hopeful for play action in this weekend’s series.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully [Tuesday’s loss] will fire us up and want to go and compete even more to win the series against Fullerton this weekend,” freshman shortstop Clay Fisher said. “I think we’re going about our business and doing our thing and not worrying too much about other teams, but really focusing on ourselves.”</p>\n<p>In the absence of the team’s two dominant hitters, the Gaucho lineup has switched from its traditional order. Senior infielder Woody Woodward has batted as the team’s leadoff hitter in three of the past four games.</p>\n<p>In that time, Woodward has had a pair of two-hit games, and a solo one-hit appearance. Hitting in the two-spot is senior third baseman Peter Maris who has put up two hits every game for the past six games.</p>\n<p>“I would hope [the offense] sticks to its approaches and starts to find a hold on more of the barrel and translate that into hits,” Mazza said.</p>\n<p>One standout Fullerton batter is junior outfielder Josh Vargas, who is putting up a .364 batting average. Vargas also leads the conference in on-base percentage with a .479 OBP. Fullerton junior Thomas Eshelman is also putting up high numbers on the mound, as he is currently throwing for the league’s fourth-best ERA at 1.94.</p>\n<p>“This [weekend] is huge. We’re tied with Fullerton right now for the Big West,” Mazza said, “And if we could win at least two of three, and hopefully a sweep over them, it would be huge for us.”</p>\n<p>The teams will face off on Titan turf starting this Friday at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 7, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

Recreation and Park District (IVRPD), which only controls I.V.’s numerous parks.</p>\n<p>The town hall was hosted by Assemblyman and AB 3 author Das Williams and divided attendees into small groups to discuss possibilities such as a utility tax, a parking tax, a transient occupy tax, a marijuana-dispensary tax, a Goleta sales tax and a party registration tax to fund the potential CSD. Taxation will fund I.V. public services including improved lighting and a parking program, among others.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61226\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61226\" data-attachment-id=\"61226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/das-williams-discussing-the-bill-with-a-community-member/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424480668\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"97\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61226\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-1-683x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Assemblyman Das Williams discussing the bill with a community member.

Attendees also favored the possible implementation of a parking program to generate additional revenues, as well as the establishment of a rental-tenant mediation board to sort out issues between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>Utilities taxable under most models presented at the meeting include water, internet, cable, gas and trash with special exemptions to low-income families under certain models.</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill language includes powers for a CSD to contract for additional public safety services such as community service officers; a rental housing mediation task force; a municipal advisory council, which would allow the CSD to advise the county on additional policy for I.V.; and an area planning commission similar to one existing in Montecito.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee (SBCC) and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the three most likely types of tax for I.V. students and residents are a utilities tax; a creative sales deliveries tax, which refers to marijuana dispensary delivery taxes; and parcel taxes, which tax properties and are primarily used to fund public education.</p>\n<p>“I think what was presented here were great,” Abboud said. “The ideas were helpful and I think the utilities tax will be the number one idea and we should definitely have that one. The creative sales deliveries tax will be good as well, which involves marijuana. A small parcel tax will also work.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the marijuana tax could be beneficial for I.V. residents because many users and non-users alike favor taxing marijuana for city revenue.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, a marijuana tax came up a lot and the utilities tax is the most popular,” Williams said. “Marijuana advocates believe that it should be taxed and it seems like they mean it; this would also help students out. It can also be paid for.”</p>\n<p>Coffee Collaborative owner Steve McDonough said he does not support the utilities tax, which charges utility users for consumption of electricity, gas, water, sewer, telephone, sanitation and cable television. According to McDonough, he would have to spend more money on necessary utilities to keep his coffee business afloat.</p>\n<p>“I do not like the utilities tax,” McDonough said. “I own a coffee shop and I use so much utility every day. A utilities tax raise would cost me more money.”</p>\n<p>McDonough also said he does not see the reason behind transient taxes, a tax aimed at out-of-towners who stay at a hotel or motel, because there are no hotels in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As for the transient tax, we do not even have any hotels in Isla Vista so I do not see the point in transient taxes,” McDonough said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he believes the proposed party registration tax is not a “real” tax because it is not implemented anywhere else.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61229\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61229\" data-attachment-id=\"61229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/community-members-brainstorm-ideas-for-service-funding/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Community Members brainstorm ideas for service funding.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424482130\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000125\",\"title\":\"Community Members brainstorm ideas for service funding.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Town Hall\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61229\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-3TownHall_Stephen-Manga-4-683x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Community members, such as Jay Freeman, above, brainstorm ideas for service funding.

It realistically would not work. I have never even heard of this anywhere else.”</p>\n<p>Doctor and founder of the Isla Vista Clinic David Bearman said the property tax option will not affect students because it is paid indirectly.</p>\n<p>“Students can have their own jobs or rely on their parents to supply them with money,” Bearman said. “Therefore, they do not pay for it directly. They pay for it very indirectly.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61244\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61244\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-22/community-meets-for-years-second-town-hall-brainstorm-taxes/","id":4762,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[4761,4760,4759],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
