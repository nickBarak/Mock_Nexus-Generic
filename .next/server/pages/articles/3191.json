Courtesy<em> of Blake Simons and Delency Parham</em></p></div>\n<p>The two Bay Area natives released the first episode of the “Hella Black Podcast” in 2015 with the goal of amplifying Black voices and covering topics that are often overlooked.</p>\n<p>“With each episode we hope to educate and inform our listeners on all things related to Blackness. Our podcast is important because it uplifts the voices of Black radical organizers who are doing the work in the field. Often times our narratives are not told,” the two wrote on their <a href=\"https://www.hellablackpod.com/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>Coming to UCSB as a podcast host is a welcome change for both Simons and Parham.</p>\n<p>Simons attended UC Berkeley as an undergraduate and Parham attended Santa Barbara City College before transferring to the University of Idaho. Both played sports at their respective universities.</p>\n<p>“I think about my experience as a student-athlete at SBCC, and it was hard enough getting folks on my own campus to take me serious. I experienced students at the UC thinking they were better than me and other students at the city college. So to come back here, and have students gathered in a room to listen to Blake and I host a live podcast…never something that would [have] crossed my mind,” Parham said in an email.</p>\n<p>The two only recently began doing live shows for the “Hella Black Podcast” in September 2018.</p>\n<p>“As the podcast started gaining more traction, we thought it would be dope to be able to engage with people and create a radical space in person to have the conversations we have. We’ve had shows in Oakland, Los Angeles, where over 100 people pulled up to each show,” Simons said in the email.</p>\n<p>While the two both have a background in writing, they realized that podcasting would allow them to reach a larger audience.</p>\n<p>“Folks might not have time to read a full article due to the constraints that capitalism puts on people, but you can listen to the podcast on your way to work or when you’re doing laundry,” Simons added.</p>\n<p>Alexandra Gessesse, financial director for the Black Student Union at UCSB, worked with A.S. Program Board Cultural &amp; Arts Coordinator Kiyomi Morrison to pull the event together.</p>\n<p>Gessesse wanted to bring the two to campus because of their experiences being Black on predominantly white campuses, and especially because of Simons’ work co-founding the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s BSU is currently trying to develop an agreement for UCSB to build a freestanding building where Black students can get access to resources and have a space for themselves.</p>\n<p>“Blake himself has pioneered a lot of what we are trying to achieve for here at our own campus, but having been a Cal alum, a UC product and having worked within the UC system for several years since he’s graduated, I felt like he could share insight to what it’s like being black within the UC,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>As an “avid listener of the podcast” herself, Gessesse believes the two tackle topics that are typically stigmatized. Some of the podcast episodes dive into sex work, the intersection of Blackness and queerness and exploitation of Black student athletes.</p>\n<p>“I want to take the time to acknowledge all the queer/trans folks, and Black women that have put in numerous hours of labor to help me develop healthier perspectives and radical politics. Blake and I like to use our platform as an opportunity to uplift their voices,” Parham said.</p>\n<p>“We both know in a patriarchal society, men’s voices will be the voices that are projected. We want to use our privilege to center the most disrespected and threatened, and be in solidarity with them.”</p>\n<p>Parham and Simons also cite their Bay Area roots and their familial connection to members of the Black Panther Party as the inspiration for their discussions.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest draws of the podcast is that the two also work as community organizers and educators, having their boots on the ground in addition to speaking on the subject.</p>\n<p>“Teaching is one way I build community and help educate Black people on the conditions of our people,” Simons said. “As community organizers we both create programs that center the most vulnerable Black people under this white supremacist capitalist state.”</p>\n<p>The two cofounded the People’s Breakfast Oakland, which provides houseless people with hot foods, clothing and hygiene products.</p>\n<p>Gessesse hopes that students attending the event come away with ideas about how to keep the needs of Black students in the fold even after Black History Month is over.</p>\n<p>“I really anticipate that not only does this talk, this conversation, does not stop at the end of February when Black History Month is over, but that we continue to make these strides in our community about coming together,” she said.</p>\n<p>At the same time, she hopes the show on Friday night can be a place where Black students come to unwind and be in a space tailor-made for them.</p>\n<p>“Being Black is political, yes, but not everything that Black people do has to be political.”</p>\n<p>Simons and Parham will be hosting their live show on Friday, March 1, at the Loma Pelona Center at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this story said that Simons alone hosts the People’s Breakfast Oakland. Simons and Parham co-founded it together.</em></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus<i>.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Former Campus United party chair Katie Mukai then filed a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/former-cu-co-chair-files-judicial-council-petition-about-on-campus-senator-salari-living-off-campus/\">petition</a> against Salari on Jan. 29, arguing that Salari should be removed from her position.</p>\n<p>The council <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/judicial-council-hears-salari-trial/\">heard arguments</a> in <em>Katie Mukai</em> v. <em>Yasamin Salari</em> on Feb. 20, with Mukai named as the petitioner and Salari as the respondent.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Judicial-Council-Opinion-On-Mukai-v.-Salari.pdf\">opinion</a> rules in favor of Mukai.</p>\n<p>“The Respondent’s place of residence constitutes a breach of the Associated Students Legal Code,” the council wrote in a statement released Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“The Judicial Council determines that the Respondent is not eligible for the position of On­-Campus Senator and finds that the Respondent cannot continue in office as On­-Campus Senator in the 69th Senate.”</p>\n<p>As stated in Associated Students (A.S.) By-­Laws Article III §1(B)(4), seen on page 21 of the most recent version of the legal code, all Senators are required to live amongst their constituents during the fall, winter and spring quarters of their terms.</p>\n<p>Salari’s representation during her trial – former Off-Campus Senator for the 68th Senate Alexandra Gessesse – argued that Salari’s living arrangement did not inhibit her ability to represent her on-campus constituents.</p>\n<p>However, the council found that Salari’s “quality of work as a Senator did not pertain to the question of eligibility.”</p>\n<p>Following Salari’s initial admission, the A.S. Senate granted her a one-time exception. During the trial, Gessesse pointed to incidents in the past when Senates granted one-time exceptions to senators who lived out of their respective constituencies.</p>\n<p>However, the council invalidated Senate’s ability to do so in Tuesday’s opinion, stating that while Senate has the power to make changes to legal code, they “are not allowed to circumvent the breach of legal code through special exceptions.”</p>\n<p>“The Legal Code of the Associated Students is the foremost authority on Associated Students rules and regulations and cannot be superseded by Senate motions and resolutions,” the council wrote in the statement.</p>\n<p>“The Students of UCSB are entitled to representation by individuals living among them. Allowing a one-­time exception to the eligibility requirements for these representative positions undermines this principle and is harmful towards the constituents’ needs.”</p>\n<p>Salari will be allowed to keep her Fall Quarter 2018 honoraria, and can apply for her Winter Quarter 2019 honoraria.</p>\n<p>The next runner up to take her place is second-year history of public policy major Eric Moon, according to Spring Quarter 2018 Election results.</p>\n<p>It is unknown at this time if or when Salari’s seat will be filled. The individual to take her place will only serve for a little more than two months before the Spring Quarter 2019 elections.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or evelyn@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), an extension of the Associated Students (A.S.) Human Rights Board, <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/asks-amended.pdf\">revised its list of Asks</a> on Feb. 4 to include mandatory training for Office of Student Life organizations and sports teams, a revised Title IX Office website and online access to Gaucho FYI content, among other requests.</p>\n<p>Monday’s town hall was the second of the year, following the first <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-26/sasa-hosts-town-hall-focuses-on-interpersonal-violence-prevention/\">town hall</a> that was held at the Pardall Center in November.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez led the meeting alongside SASA Vice Director Alya Ruiz and SASA Policy Analysts Vince Feliciano and Alia Reynolds.</p>\n<p>Title IX Officer Ariana Alvarez began by providing an update on the Department of Education’s <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-nprm.pdf\">Proposed Title IX Amendments</a>. The department is still in the process of reviewing comments, which means that the status of the amendments is still unclear, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>The most concerning potential regulations include changes to the evidence threshold, scope of jurisdiction and responsible employee designation, according to Alvarez. Additional amendments include the right to cross-examination of survivors and perpetrators and a narrowing of the definition of sexual assault under Title IX.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy and Resources Education (C.A.R.E.) Director Briana Conway said to students that despite the potential stress the proposed changes could bring survivors, C.A.R.E. will work to support them through the legal process however it can.</p>\n<p>Reynolds pointed to <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB493\">Senate Bill 493</a>, a piece of legislation recently introduced by Senator Hannah Beth Hannah-Beth Jackson, which aims to combat potential issues arising from the amendments.</p>\n<p>Reynolds questioned whether the UCSB administration would be taking a stance on the legislation. The UC system <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-03/uc-responds-to-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\">released a response</a> to the proposed amendments in December 2018, stating that the changes would “reverse decades of well-established, hard-won progress toward equity.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez responded that they are aware of the bill and are currently trying to navigate its position.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life Miles Ashlock discussed the possibility of requiring Standard of Excellence Training for OSL organizations and sports teams, which is another Ask proposed by SASA.</p>\n<p>The Standards of Excellence is an educational program run by C.A.R.E. that is currently required for fraternities and sororities on campus. SASA has requested that the training be required for all OSL organizations and sports teams.</p>\n<p>The current obstacles for Standards of Excellence training concerns the content of the curriculum, which is still under discussion, Ashlock said. OSL plans to meet with C.A.R.E. to review the Standards of Excellence.</p>\n<p>Alvarez gave an update on SASA’s third Ask, which requests a redesigned Public Accountability Report modeled after UCLA’s Title IX Office. UCLA’s model features an “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB currently produces an annual report, SASA feels that shifting to UCLA’s model will provide more thorough information.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Title IX Office is in the process of considering which aspects of UCLA’s model may be beneficial for UCSB, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Students and Director of Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity Kimberly Equinoa discussed the online accessibility of Gaucho FYI content, another Ask proposed by SASA.</p>\n<p>Equinoa predicts that the Gaucho FYI content will be accessible online within the next couple of months.</p>\n<p>SASA officers also discussed the Ask that requests $5,000 annually from UCSB. The funds would be used “to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>Ruiz clarified that funds for this request would ideally come from university fees, not student fees.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn suggested a formal proposal and budget for the ask, detailing what the campaign will accomplish. The SASA officers agreed to follow up on this request.</p>\n<p>SASA officers moved on to discuss the National College Health Assessment, a survey distributed to over 100 universities nationwide that assesses students’ “habits, behaviors, and perceptions,” according to National College Health Assessment website.</p>\n<p>The survey questions students on topics ranging from alcohol and drug use to personal safety and violence. It was distributed to UCSB students via email on Feb. 12.</p>\n<p>Ashlock explained that the survey provides reliable national data, allowing administration to see which issues are unique or less prevalent at UCSB. These trends allow administrators to gauge which programs and policies are beneficial.</p>\n<p>Feliciano voiced several of SASA’s concerns regarding the survey, including its lack of trigger warnings and feedback opportunities. He noted that SASA officers were also disturbed that the survey did not list any resources and neglected to give a clear definition of affirmative consent.</p>\n<p>Conway responded that UCSB did not have any jurisdiction over the content of the survey itself, only the email that was sent to students. The email provided a trigger warning, stating that there may be some “personal discomfort with the content of certain questions.”</p>\n<p>Conway also explained that the Health Equity Initiative, a work group that promotes health equity for underserved students, went through the survey last spring and wrote recommendations to the national organization. The group consists of members from RCSGD, C.A.R.E., C.A.P.S., Student Health, the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, Health &amp; Wellness and the Women’s Center.</p>\n<p>UCSB administration requested that the SASA Officers compose their feedback in writing to allow them to seriously acknowledge their concerns.</p>\n<p>SASA’s next town hall will take place in Spring Quarter, with exact date and location yet to be determined.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

But without him, the Thunder will rely on Reggie Jackson to keep OKC at the same offensively dangerous squad.</p>\n<p>Jackson performed well in game four of OKC’s series against Houston in his first start this postseason, but the Thunder were clearly lacking that killer mentality Westbrook displays so often when driving to the rim.</p>\n<p>I bet the Thunder wish it hadn’t traded away James Harden now that it is once again in need of a scoring partner to complement Durant.</p>\n<p>Injuries aside, that trade made sense, but without Westbrook, OKC lacks the scoring capabilities to defeat the Spurs.</p>\n<p>San Antonio keeps defying the odds of time, compiling the second-best record in the West with the aging trio of Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker.</p>\n<p>The difference maker for the Spurs this postseason will be Parker.</p>\n<p>If the Spurs and Thunder square off in the Western Conference Finals, San Antonio will clearly have the edge at the point guard position with Tony Parker running circles around Reggie Jackson.</p>\n<p>Unless Jackson comes up with some major performances this postseason, OKC may not have the capability to beat the winner of the Clippers/Grizzlies, let alone the Spurs.</p>\n<p>Postseason experience is still on the side of the Spurs and with a core group of veterans to go along with some impressive young players including Kawhi Leonard and Tiago Splitter, San Antonio has the tools necessary to take down a shorthanded Thunder squad.</p>\n<p>OKC and San Antonio split the four games they played this season with Westbrook averaging 24 points and 7 assists in the regular season. The Thunder needed every bit of his contribution against the Spurs, and with Reggie Jackson unlikely to match Westbrook’s production level on both ends of the floor, it looks unlikely OKC will return to the finals if it faces off against San Antonio.</p>\n<p>At this point in the postseason, San Antonio seems like the favorite to represent the Western Conference in the NBA Finals not because they are the best team, but because they are the healthiest at this point in the season.</p>\n<p>That seemed like an unlikely statement only weeks ago. It goes to show just how unpredictable the NBA postseason can be.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 1st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51119\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-san-antonio-is-healthy-and-ready-to-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51119\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-san-antonio-is-healthy-and-ready-to-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-san-antonio-is-healthy-and-ready-to-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-san-antonio-is-healthy-and-ready-to-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-san-antonio-is-healthy-and-ready-to-win/","id":3190,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3189,3188,3187],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
