Less than I’m worth.</p>\n<p>You can always send a letter to the editor.</p>\n<p>No, I won’t be apologizing/pulling the article/taking the article off the website because you now show up in Google hits for “drunk in public.”</p>\n<p>I think that just about covers it – every answer to every question posed to me from readers for the past year. And what a year. Excuse me for taunting you with my superiority complex and self-fellating egoism, but this is the column to do it in. My goodbye column. My au revoir to the Daily Nexus. My exit stage left.</p>\n<p>We got some redesigns, plumped up our columnists to opinion page ratio, hired the best staff this side of the Goleta Slough, broke top news, saved the Nexus from government ineptitude with the cunning use of middle-fingering, and hey, along with the Daily Sound, we’re the only daily newspaper left in this city. Cheers!</p>\n<p>Yep, to answer your next question, I am pretty hot shit.</p>\n<p>And I owe it all to you. No, not you, the average reader, reading this. I mean the people below in the staff box, and all those who came before and all those yet to come. Thank you, Brendan Buhler, Jason La (I learned the most from you), Daniel Haier, Matt Dozier. My hat’s off to Kristen Richer. Thanks for the memories; hope y’all join me in Nexus Valhalla for a few drinks.</p>\n<p>Where would I be without my loyal staff this year? It’s rare to work with people you love, and even rarer to work with people you respect and trust to do the job well.</p>\n<p>My friends, I wish I had the words, I often do, but they say to write from your heart and since you have half of mine, this message will be a slice of what it could have been.</p>\n<p>To Devon Claire Flannery, for being my first lieutenant and second set of eyes, particularly for catching all those potentially ugly mistakes (as well as the ones that got through). You not only polished the paper, you made it sparkle. You also kept us out of a lot of trouble, while managing to raise hell. If I weren’t such a stickler, I give you a smiley emoticon right now.</p>\n<p>Police Blotter extraordinaire Nikki Moore – barrel of monkeys level of fun and Southern Comfort level of intoxicating. You steered a big ship at county desk, and brought in too many catches to count. Here’s to your passion; it made it all the while.</p>\n<p>David Ferry. Stop whatever you’re doing. No, put it down. Put Aria down. And yes, there is a Santa Claus. He’s bringing you pants without holes in them.</p>\n<p>Dana Olsen, you’ve got a big job ahead of you, one I know you’re ready for. Have fun covering county supervisors, court cases, drunken revelry and the occasional dead albino raccoon. You’ll do it with flare and maybe a “Legends of the Hidden Temple” shirt.</p>\n<p>Miss Lindsey Miller – you were a constant counselor, a wise peer and a good friend. You did a better job at university desk than I, and probably with a lot less yelling. I’m glad we grew up in the office together. The honor was all mine. (Comma splice!)</p>\n<p>Megan “I’m not 15” Snedden: I had you picked out from day one, kid. You’re going far. You deserve nothing less. When I own my own paper, I’ll let you cover Leg again, if you really want it.</p>\n<p>Aria Miran. You and Ferry need a timeout. But really, a few laughs and inappropriate jokes with you make the medicine go down. You definitely make it to my top eight MySpace friends list. Even as a fresh-faced reporter you stuck out as something more, like a fresh-faced university editor. Welcome to the desk; I wouldn’t want it left in any other hands.</p>\n<p>I’m really sorry, Sabrina Ricci, for all those times we accidentally called you “Christina Ricci” when you weren’t in news meeting. Now you know. And now I’m graduating, so you can’t get mad. You got heart and the fortunate job of “layout editor,” complete with all the sexual innuendos associated with “laying” stuff out.</p>\n<p>Aaron Wu and Matt O’Leary, y’all put up with some confused editors, last minute shots and spectacularly boring board meetings. Thank you for your endless patience. We would be spectacularly boring without you. And sans pretty pictures.</p>\n<p>To my most valuable player and fellow graduate Anna Oleson-Wheeler. What didn’t you do? AOW, with a flick of your wrist you had AP, reception and production under wraps, with a bit of nod to sports. Thanks for the memories and double thanks for the booze.</p>\n<p>To Barb Maclean, Linda Meyer and J.E. Anderson. Your devotion to us kids knows no bounds, and your guidance was irreplaceable. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope we made you proud.</p>\n<p>More with sports, we got Chris Hoffman, but my heart belongs to Monique Moyal and Jeff Gibson. Monique, we missed you. And Jeff, you need to stop stressing. You should try pot sometime.</p>\n<p>Those cool kids at Artsweek – Mollie Vandor, Sophia Kercher and my fellow Lasallian Cameron Smith – thanks for putting up with the changes, but also thanks for delivering the hipster to our pages. It’s nice not being lame through and through.</p>\n<p>Oh, Nicki Arnold. Way to hold the fort down in the opinion office, and thank you for being a great staff writer the year before. You are the bee’s knees, and have a contagious smile.</p>\n<p>Mark Batalla, my answer to your question is “Oh. Dear. God. Sigh. Fine, print it.” You were my happiest excuse never to censor, and I’m glad you trusted to ask me first. You dedicated more of your talent here than just about anyone, and it certainly didn’t go unnoticed. I’d mention each of your artists by name, but I’d rather someone write in angry about it so I could see more of their work. You all made the opinion page everyone’s first stop in the morning. It was a pleasure.</p>\n<p>Online Editor Craig Calkins, Jesus Christ you stepped it up. We’ll make it to that shining city of perfect websites one of these days. You were tenacious, talented and occasionally morally perverse, a contradiction wrapped in a certainty. I don’t even know what I just wrote, but you were awesome.</p>\n<p>But I’m eager to get on you, copy cats. Copy, you will always be loved, sometimes feared, with nothing but a comma and an adverb separating the two. Dianne Jobson, good luck in your new position. Just slow down on the caffeine pills. Kate Rushton, I’m glad to be graduating with you, though I’ll also be glad to see you at your new beginnings – you’ve got the right stuff. Valerie Tidwell, not only are you a worthy redhead, you’re also the sharpest knife in the drawer, capable of cutting anyone down to size. You were a miracle staff writer as well.</p>\n<p>Melissa Davis and Becky Gayle, you deserve a special place in my heart, and I will miss you. Melissa, McCarthy was a bad man. Becky, goddamn we missed you.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to name all of you, copy (par for the course, right?). Just know you had the hardest job and a hushed respect in the office. You made my nights a joy, and my newspaper the best I’ve seen. Thank you so much.</p>\n<p>How much happiness it brings me to end with you, Nick DŸrnhšfer. The wisest advice I received when I became editor I will now pass on to you: It doesn’t matter if you break the biggest story of the century, or take down some bad guys or win first place awards in every category. It matters that you take care of the Nexus so that one day, your successor can. You’ve learned all you can from me, and outpaced my creativity. I got a sneaking feeling you’re going to be that first-place-winning successor.</p>\n<p>Just remember that a year from now, all this will seem very funny. You have no idea what that means now. I didn’t when Dozier told me, or when Daniel told him, etc. You’ll get it. But don’t rush there. You got some time to put in.</p>\n<p>Goodbye, my friends. So long, and see you later. Goodnight Nexus, one last time.<br>\nYour Friend,<br>\nKaitlin Pike</p>\n<p>P.S. Oh, and to Jerry Roberts: Don’t worry, I would never sue you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Now define the term “tradition” and the same process follows a loose-ended description of carrying on beliefs from one generation to the next.</p>\n<p>We’ve seen moments in sports where the two components infuse together and create a masterpiece. The Brady-Belichick era, the John Wooden dynasty, the “Core Four” Yankees and more are all relevant examples that permeate the mind when it comes to building a tradition of success.</p>\n<p>But what about the teams that don’t get the same spotlight as these prominent professional dynasties but still deserve to be in this conversation of greatness? Are there other cases of success and tradition that move beyond the noteworthy teams we have come to know and praise? This is the case for Head Coach Geno Auriemma and the UConn Huskies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Achieving success has never been an easy feat when it comes to any sport, but for Auriemma, it has evolved into a fundamental piece of his program. The American Athletic Conference coach has a proven winner with 979 career wins, 28 NCAA Tournament appearances and 11 national championship titles under his belt.</p>\n<p>Just as of Monday night, Auriemma and the Huskies’ program made history by winning their 100th-straight game, which continued UCONN’s longest streak in NCAA basketball history ever.</p>\n<p>The Huskies took down South Carolina 66-55 Monday night. Securing their niche in history, Auriemma and his Huskies continue to reinvent a culture of basketball that is the epitome of longevity for over two decades as the result of one element: winning.</p>\n<p>During his 22 years in Connecticut, Auriemma has crafted some of the finest female athletes to ever hit the hardwood floor. His ability to develop players and help them reach the next level has helped create four Rookie of the Year award winners, nine All-Stars and 12 WNBA champions over the span of 18 years.</p>\n<p>Stars such as Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, and Maya Moore flourished during their collegiate time in Harry A. Gampel Pavilion and under Auriemma, but more importantly, they’ve been able to transfer a winning culture over to their respective WNBA teams.</p>\n<p>As a result, there is no doubt the Huskies’ 2006 enshrinement into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame was well beyond well-deserved. However, the problem remains that Auriemma continues to be overshadowed by the celebrated teams of professional sports.</p>\n<p>Is there a reason the eight-time AP Coach of the Year lacks recognition when commemorating current coaching legends like Gregg Popovich and Belichick? Could this lack of appreciation be due to the polarized attitudes toward intercollegiate athletics and women’s sports? Whatever the case may be, Auriemma has accomplished multiple achievements, specifically his most recent, that are worthy of some praise.</p>\n<p>In an interview with “Good Morning America” co-host Robin Roberts, Auriemma stated, “I try to tell these kids they’re already part of history. No one can ever take that away from them, and all they can do is continue to add to it.”</p>\n<p>Numbers and accolades only paint a small portion of the picture for Geno Auriemma. As a man with excellence at the core of his program, Auriemma can be reasonably justified as his own placement as one of the greatest coach’s in sports history ever.</p>\n<p>His presence as a teacher and role model is one that uniquely connects with a younger generation of college athletes striving to create their own legacy of dominance.</p>\n<p>Auriemma’s time at UConn and current 100-game win streak for the school will be internalized as an unforgettable moment in sports. His efforts stand as a reflection, revision, and redefinition of what a “winning tradition” consists of. Success and tradition can come in many forms; this year’s Huskies are proof of that.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75765\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75765\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/geno-auriemma-and-uconn-womens-basketball-a-dynasty-built-on-the-tradition-of-success/","id":3359,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[3358,3357,3356],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Graduate Students to Call in Sick on Wednesday in Support of UCSC Strike for Cost of Living Adjustment","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GSA_Sophia-Lovell_ONLNE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GSA_Sophia-Lovell_ONLNE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB graduate students, on average, would need an additional $1133.57 for their rent to equal 30% of their income, according to an informal UCSB GSA survey.

With a remarkable total of 31 sacks and 47 tackles for loss in his three-year career as an Aggie, scouts are raving about this future rookie with all-pro potential. Just to add more fuel to the fire, Garrett, at 6’5” and 271 lbs, ran a 4.62 time in the 40-yard dash at his pro day. At this point, it’d be foolish for the Browns to pass up on such a franchise talent.       </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 2 San Francisco 49ers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Solomon Thomas, DE, Stanford </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With player comparisons to Brandon Graham, or even “a smaller J.J. Watt,” Solomon Thomas caught many scouts’ eyes during his two-year stint at Stanford. Following an impressive combine performance, we saw Thomas’s draft stock rise and rise. Now with, new 49ers general manager John Lynch at the helm, he’ll make sure to play it safe with his inaugural first-round pick and pick the next-best player after Garrett.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 3 Chicago Bears:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Allen, DE, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winner of the 2016 Bronco Nagurski Trophy for best college defensive player in the nation, Jonathan Allen had quite the outstanding campaign during his four years at Alabama. With 152 total tackles and 28 sacks, Allen has the stats and durability to prove that he’s NFL-ready. The Bears could look to bolster either their defensive line or secondary here. One thing is for sure, Chicago’s defense could really use a first-round game changer.    </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 4 Jacksonville Jaguars:</b></p>\n<p><b>Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before starting with Leonard Fournette, we urge you to please look up some of his highlights. At 6’1” and 228 lbs, he possesses the ability to escape the line of scrimmage and the strength to break the tackle. Fournette’s play style has been appropriately compared to that of Ezekiel Elliott’s, and he is arguably the best offensive player in the entire draft. This LSU halfback has what it takes to be a week-one starter in Jacksonville and may very well be the spark needed to get the Jaguars’ offense going.         </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 5 Tennessee Titans:</b></p>\n<p><b>Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the 2016 college football season, Ohio State’s Marshon Lattimore allowed an average NFL passer rating of 30.2 whenever he covered the throw. Do you know what the NFL passer rating is for spiking the ball into the ground on every play? It’s 39.6. Yeah, you don’t need to be a statistician to realize that’s ridiculous. This year, Lattimore is heralded as the best cornerback coming out of college, so the Titans would be wise to choose him over a wide receiver because he definitely won’t be present for their 18th overall pick.   </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 6 New York Jets:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jamal Adams, S, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been multiple reports recently that a Jamal Adams as a first overall talent. However, analysts agree that the Browns probably won’t trade out of the first pick and will most likely let Adams fall to another team. Regardless, with 209 total tackles and five interceptions throughout his college career, the Jets find their missing link with this pick.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 7 Los Angeles Chargers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Malik Hooker, S, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chargers have built a sneaky good secondary over the past few seasons. So after a stellar combine performance by Malik Hooker, it very well seems he is San Diego-bound. With seven interceptions in only two seasons at Ohio State, Hooker has arguably the best hands in the draft.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 8 Carolina Panthers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Fournette off the board, the Panthers have a choice to make at running back. The very versatile Christian McCaffrey is an interesting option as well, but Carolina will ultimately settle for a halfback that can get it done on every down. At 4,464 yards and 46 touchdowns over three seasons for Florida State, Dalvin Cook will relieve some pressure off his quarterback and former league MVP, Cam Newton.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 9 Cincinnati Bengals:</b></p>\n<p><b>Corey Davis, WR, Western Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bengals really hit the jackpot with both A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert highlighting their receiving corps. Unfortunately, they both face injury issues from time to time, and this is most likely due to excessive targets are thrown their way. Corey Davis has the speed and build to be a quality NFL wide receiver, so the Bengals use their No. 9 spot to form an elite trio that defenses around the league must respect.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 10 Buffalo Bills:</b></p>\n<p><b>Mike Williams, WR, Clemson </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sammy Watkins can’t get it done all by himself, so the Bills get quarterback Tyrod Taylor another target in Mike Williams. With 2,727 yards and 21 touchdowns over his four-year career at Clemson, Williams is the best receiver in this draft for many analysts. Considering his 98 receptions in just his senior year alone, it’s proven he can handle the workload of a No. 1 receiver as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 11 New Orleans Saints:</b></p>\n<p><b>Derek Barnett, DE, Tennessee </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In only three seasons at Tennessee, Derek Barnett racked up 32 sacks and 52 tackles for loss. These are numbers that rival Myles Garrett and other top defensive lineman in this draft, so why is he projected lower than the rest? Well, after an average performance at the NFL combine, Barnett’s draft stock began to slowly fall. Nevertheless, the stats are there and the Saints will capitalize on other teams’ dismissal of Barnett’s talent. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 12 Cleveland Browns:</b></p>\n<p><b>O.J. Howard, TE, Alabama</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Browns will close out their first-round picks with yet another player that is starter ready. O.J. Howard, the four-year tight end out of Alabama, will provide Cleveland with a 6’6” and 242 lbs target that can get it done down the middle or in the red zone. This spot may even see a quarterback selection, but with Terrelle Pryor Sr. out of the mix, another good set of hands may be the more rational option. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 13 Arizona Cardinals:</b></p>\n<p><b>Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a while now, the Cardinals have been looking for a lockdown corner that can play opposite of Patrick Peterson. Well, luckily for them, reports agree that this year’s draft talent is very deep at the cornerback position. Marlon Humphrey was the star corner at Alabama, so with five interceptions and 81 total tackles in just his two-year college career, this pick makes sense for Arizona.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 14 Philadelphia Eagles:</b></p>\n<p><b>Tre’Davious White, CB, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eagles were busy during this offseason free agency with the signings of Alshon Jeffery to the receiving corps and Chris Long to the defensive line. So their remaining draft priorities are for a corner or running back. This can very much be where McCaffrey is selected, but the Eagles ultimately fill the most pressing need and take the 167 total tackles and six interceptions: Tre’Davious White.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 15 Indianapolis Colts:</b></p>\n<p><b>Reuben Foster, LB, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s another draft prospect with some astonishing game film. We recommend you look up some Reuben Foster highlights because he could very well be one of the hardest hitting linebackers coming out of college since the turn of the century. With 211 total tackles and seven sacks over three seasons at Alabama, Foster would be a steal for the Colts, if he even falls this far. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 16 Baltimore Ravens:</b></p>\n<p><b>Taco Charlton, DE, Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ravens will be building through the draft in order to re-establish a frightening defense that has twice earned them a Super Bowl title. With a couple of free agency losses to the defensive line, the Ravens select a quality defensive end in Taco Charlton. Charlton put up 28 tackles for loss and 19 sacks in his four years for Michigan. He also has the best first name in this entire draft.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 17 Washington Redskins:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jabrill Peppers, LB, Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve seen mock drafts that have Jabrill Peppers going as early as the top 10 and as late as the second round. So No. 17 overall seems like a fair spot to place the former Heisman nominee. Peppers is an all-around athletic machine, with great stats in both offensive and defensive positions. The Redskins need a playmaker that’ll make his presence known throughout the game, so they pick up this prolific Michigan linebacker.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 18 Tennessee Titans:</b></p>\n<p><b>John Ross, WR, Washington </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Ross caught many scouts’ eyes at the combine when he set the 40-yard dash record with a 4.22 time, but it’ll also be his route running skills that’ll make him go in the first round of the NFL draft. In his junior year alone, Ross caught 81 receptions for 1,150 yards and 17 touchdowns. With Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota throwing to him, this wide receiver out of Washington will likely be burning defensive backs all season long.     </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 19 Tampa Bay Buccaneers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Christian McCaffrey, RB, Stanford</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Buccaneers are currently rethinking their future with Doug Martin as their lead back. So they’ll look to the draft in order to find a replacement for the pro bowler. Enter Christian McCaffrey, the record-breaking running back out of Stanford. In only three years, McCaffrey rushed for 3,922 yards on 632 attempts. He also caught plenty out of the backfield with 99 receptions for 1,206 yards, bringing his total count to 31 touchdowns. With pick 19, Tampa Bay finds a potential franchise halfback.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 20 Denver Broncos:</b></p>\n<p><b>Garett Bolles, OT, Utah</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a bit of a quarterback conundrum going on in Denver at the moment. Whether it’s Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch lining up under center, they’ll need to beef up their offensive line in this year’s draft. With the Bronco’s first round pick, they select, the 6’5” and 300-pound offensive tackle, Garett Bolles out of Utah. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 21 Detroit Lions:</b></p>\n<p><b>Charles Harris, DE, Missouri </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this pick, the Lions pretty much just go for the best available player still on the board. With 34.5 tackles for loss and 18 sacks in his three seasons at Missouri, Charles Harris’s size and athleticism will easily translate into continued success within the NFL. He’ll also greatly complement Ezekiel Ansah and Haloti Ngata on the Detroit defensive line.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 22 Miami Dolphins:</b></p>\n<p><b>Forrest Lamp, OG, Western Kentucky</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One could argue that quarterback Ryan Tannehill isn’t at the franchise level, but with quality starting quarterbacks currently a scarcity in the league, the Dolphins decide to add more depth to the pass protection position. Forrest Lamp, after a great combine showing and consistent college numbers, is arguably the best offensive prospect in this year’s draft.   </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 23 New York Giants:</b></p>\n<p><b>Ryan Ramczyk, OT, Wisconsin </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quarterback has also been projected for this pick, but the Giants ultimately decide to choose a tackle that can protect their star quarterback Eli Manning. At 6’6” and 314 lbs, Ryan Ramczyk will not only protect from the pass rush but also help with the outside running game in New York.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 24 Oakland Raiders:</b></p>\n<p><b>Malik McDowell, DL, Michigan State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McDowell’s draft stock rose after his combine day impressed various scouts. Now the Raiders are projected to select this three-year Michigan State Spartan that recorded 24.5 tackles for loss with 88 total tackles.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 25 Houston Texans:</b></p>\n<p><b>Deshaun Watson, QB, Clemson</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, we have the first quarterback in the entire draft go at No. 25. Deshaun Watson, out of Clemson, is arguably the most prepared when it comes to being in control and winning games for his team. In 38 games for Clemson, he put up over 10,000 passing yards for a total of 90 touchdowns. The Texans Band-Aid their Brock Osweiler mistake and get potentially a franchise quarterback in Watson with their first-round pick.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 26 Seattle Seahawks:</b></p>\n<p><b>Cam Robinson, OT, Alabama</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been plenty of rumors recently that the Seahawks will lose star cornerback Richard Sherman via trade, causing Seattle to draft defensive back Kevin King in the first. However, we believe Sherman will be in a Seahawks uniform next year and that Cam Robinson will be plugged right into Seattle’s o-line.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 27 Kansas City Chiefs:</b></p>\n<p><b>Zach Cunningham, LB, Vanderbilt</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kansas City’s defense has been a force to be reckoned with in past seasons, so they’ll add to the hype with this pick. Following Reuben Foster, Zach Cunningham is in the conversation for the next best at the linebacker position. This playmaker out of Vanderbilt is a tackling machine, with 256 total tackles in just three seasons of his college career. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 28 Dallas Cowboys:</b></p>\n<p><b>Takkarist McKinley, LB, UCLA </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cowboys have gotten a lot of criticism recently concerning their defensive play, and after losing a few starters to free agency, there’ll be some spots to fill. Cornerbacks, like Sidney Jones or Teez Tabor, who slipped out of the early first round are projected here. However, the Cowboys go ahead and choose UCLA linebacker Takkarist McKinley for his big frame and great athleticism. </span><br>\n<b>No. 29 Green Bay Packers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Gareon Conley, CB, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a roulette of starters and a couple of injuries at cornerback, Green Bay decides to go with a Buckeye and select Gareon Conley as their first-rounder. Conley had 91 tackles and six interceptions in his three seasons at Ohio State. Alongside Lattimore and Hooker, Conley helped form perhaps the best defensive back trio in college football last season. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 30 Pittsburgh Steelers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Obi Melifonwu, S, Connecticut </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obi Melifonwu had arguably the best combine day out of anyone else in the draft. At 6’3” and 217 lbs, his draft stock skyrocketed after he put on a show in front of the scouts. In four seasons with Connecticut, Melifonwu made 349 total tackles and caught eight interceptions as a college safety.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 31 Atlanta Falcons:  </b></p>\n<p><b> T.J. Watt, LB, Wisconsin</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a disastrous Super Bowl, Atlanta is now aware of a few spots that need replacing throughout the defensive line. So they look to linebacker T.J. Watt out of Wisconsin to remedy this. In just a pair of seasons, Watt had 17 tackles for loss and 11.5 sacks. This 6’5” linebacker definitely has the size to be in this league, but can he be as big as his brother J.J. Watt? The Falcons sure hope so.</span></p>\n<p><b><strong>No.32 </strong>New England Patriots:</b></p>\n<p><strong>Adoree’ Jackson, CB, University of Southern California </strong></p>\n<p>Seeking a defensive leader in their secondary, the Saints will close out the first round finding one in cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. Over his 3 seasons at USC, Jackson put up 139 total tackles and 6 interceptions. To top it all off, he’s also a dual threat on special teams with 4 kickoff return touchdowns and another 4 coming off punt returns.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77317\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77317\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/","id":3361,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3360,3359,3358],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
