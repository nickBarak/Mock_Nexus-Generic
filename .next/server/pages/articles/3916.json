bill “Statue of Liberty Values Act,” which aims to block federal funding for President Trump’s seven-nation immigration ban. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal has co-sponsored a bill that would defund President Donald Trump’s immigration ban, adding his name to a list of California legislators taking action against the executive order.</p>\n<p>Trump announced his travel ban last Friday, halting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the intake of refugees from Syria.</p>\n<p>Carbajal, who represents California’s 24th District, is co-sponsoring a bill introduced by California Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren titled “Statue of Liberty Values (SOLVE) Act,” which would eradicate and block all federal funding for Trump’s executive order.</p>\n<p>“Our country’s safety and national security is paramount,” Carbajal stated in a press release on Monday. “President Trump’s overly broad executive order only serves to fuel anti-American sentiment and propaganda, putting our national security at risk.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, Carbajal believes the executive order “demonstrates dangerous and irresponsible leadership” because it “developed hastily” and was not thoroughly discussed with national security agencies.</p>\n<p>Tess Whittlesey, communications director for Congressman Carbajal, said the Senate majority is refusing to bring the bill to the floor for consideration because Republicans, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, are in favor of the president’s order.</p>\n<p>However, Whittlesey said it is “important to be a strong advocate” for immigrant communities, even if the bill does not move forward.</p>\n<p>“He’s here fighting for Central Coast values no matter what the odds are of legislation getting picked up,” Whittlesey said. “It’s what he believes in, and he’s going to keep fighting for those values here in Washington.”</p>\n<p>Austin Hechler, Associated Students (A.S.) president and fourth-year political science major, said Carbajal’s actions demonstrate how California is “extremely diverse and inclusive.”</p>\n<p>State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, chair of the California Senate Judiciary Committee, said she admires Carbajal’s sponsorship of the bill and his condemnation of Trump’s “outrageous behavior.”</p>\n<p>“Our system of government has checks and balances, and I think it’s critically important that the Congress, which is one of those checks and balances, does, in fact, do its job,” Jackson said. “I appreciate Congressman Carbajal … and I believe every congressmember willing to follow the Constitution and their oath of office should be doing the same.”</p>\n<p>The California Senate Judiciary Committee passed Senate Resolution 16 on Monday, which condemns Trump’s ban as a “discriminatory overreach” and urges the president to revoke the executive order. The resolution also asked the Department of Homeland Security to allow immigrant detainees access to legal counsel “as quickly as feasible.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the committee met Tuesday to discuss three bills that would provide legal assistance for immigrants facing deportation, outlaw local law enforcement from investigating someone based on immigration status and prohibit state agencies from disclosing a person’s religious affiliation to the federal government.</p>\n<p>Jackson said constituents have expressed concern to her about their safety, as some have been “terrorized by people who have been emboldened by [Trump’s] intolerance.”</p>\n<p>“The best way to deal with this would be to educate people,” Jackson said. “I don’t think that people are inherently unkind to each other. We need to teach and talk with each other and recognize the importance of kindness and compassion.”</p>\n<p>According to Whittlesey, the state Senate’s work to limit the power of the executive order in California, along with Carbajal’s support in Congress, foreshadows how California will respond in the future to contentious presidential orders.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re going to see California reacting to a lot of Trump’s policies going forward,” Whittlesey said. “We’re definitely going to be a face of resistance during the administration.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75416\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75416\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/","id":3916,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3915,3914,3913],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox","biography":"Not available","articles":[2252,2253,2310,2323,2350,2353,2354,2361,2362,2363,2365,2366,2367,2373,2379,2389,2398,2402,2414,2415,2423,2434,2442,2445,2462,2467,2471,2472,2479,2480,2487,2517,2522,2524,2545,2570,2576,2617,2636,2672,2714,2719,2721,2741,2832,3427,3587,3656,3746,3751,3770,3771,3802,3916,3917,3949,3955,3957,3966,4368,4370,4385,4443,4588,4611,4631,4808,7224],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

The district as a whole registered around 9,600 more people this year than in the 2012 election.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista voter registration drives set a new record during the last week of October, registering over 13,000 new voters for the November election. Approximately 11,000 students were registered in 2012 and 10,800 were registered in 2010.</p>\n<p>UCSB leads other universities such as UCLA, which reported approximately 10,100 registered voters, USC, which registered a mere 411 students according to The Daily Bruin and UC San Diego, which reported around 3,000 registered voters according to the UCSD voter registration coalition.</p>\n<p>“They have done a better job of turnout in Isla Vista than I have ever seen, over 13,000 voters voted in Isla Vista today, and it’s because of the very, very hard work of these democrat activists,” Das Williams, supervisor elect, said.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara County, 60 percent of the presidential votes went to Secretary Clinton, 32 percent to Trump, 3.5 percent to Gary Johnson and 2 percent were write-ins. California is undeniably a liberal state, so higher voter turnout likely wouldn’t have changed any results here, but in other states voter turnout could have made all the difference in this pinnacle election.</p>\n<p>Millennials proved to be a major force in this year’s election. A photo from SurveyMonkey showing the country’s Electoral College votes if only millennials had voted went viral on Tuesday, with the large majority of them, 473 to be exact, going to Secretary Clinton.</p>\n<p>Millennials supported Clinton with 54 percent of the youth vote, but many millennials are angry with rumors of thousands of young people writing in “Harambe” on their ballots or even for voting for third-party candidates. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported, “For the Democratic Party to move forward and win, young people — some of the party’s most vocal critics — cannot be shut out of what will be a rebuilding process.”</p>\n<p>The 3rd District County Board of Supervisors had a large turnout of 25,136 votes with Joan Hartmann leading Bruce Porter by 8 percent. The Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District had a total of 7,317 votes to reelect Pegeen Soutar as director of the District.</p>\n<p>Measures E and F had an underwhelming amount of voter turnout with approximately 4,150 votes on each measure. Measure E passed with a significant majority of 88 percent, but Measure F, which only 62 percent of people voted yes on, did not pass. If voter turnout had been even higher, perhaps Measure F would have gone through or results for various different offices could have been different.</p>\n<p>Though turnout was strong, an anonymous Campus Democrats volunteer said that word of mouth was that at 6 p.m. on Tuesday only half of registered voters in I.V. had actually voted.</p>\n<p>In 2008, national voter turnout was relatively high at 62.3 percent but dropped in 2012 to an estimated 57.5 percent. This year’s turnout, expected to level around 55.6 percent according to the U.S. Elections Project, shows a trend toward Americans across the country not casting their vote. Reasons for not voting range from being blocked or restricted, being too busy with work and/or childcare, to simply deciding not to vote on principle, according to The New York Times.</p>\n<p><em>A

orbit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing approximately 229 feet tall, the nine-engine rocket soared into a cloudless blue sky at 9:54 a.m., following weather delays due to heavy rains in the Central Coast this week and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an on-pad explosion during a scheduled test on Sep.1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The launch was the first of seven planned to commence over the next 18 months as Iridium Communications Inc. replaces their existing network of satellites spanning the globe. Once complete, the program will have replaced the entire Iridium satellite constellation, a feat Iridium describes as the largest “tech upgrade” in history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, and six years later it </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">became the first privately funded company to put a payload in Earth orbit</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. SpaceX Communications Director John Taylor said he couldn’t disclose the SpaceX CEO and founder’s location. He said, however, that either Musk or SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell are always on site in the launch control center.</span></p>\n<p>Whether on location or not, Musk was certainly monitoring the start of the program which SpaceX first embarked on eight years ago, evident by his Twitter feed throughout the launch procedures.</p>\n<p>At 11:05 a.m. he posted “Mission looks good. Started deploying the 10 Iridium satellites. Rocket is stable on the droneship,” and later retweeted a photo of the Falcon 9 rocket safely docked on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship stationed in the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"74838\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-15/spacex-launch-commences-groundbreaking-satellite-program-after-eight-years-in-development/spacex/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?fit=587%2C396&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"587,396\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"spacex\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?fit=587%2C396&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74838\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?resize=587%2C396\" alt=\"Twitter.com\" width=\"587\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?w=587&amp;ssl=1 587w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SpaceX.png?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>The satellites were delivered into a “temporary parking orbit” at 625 km to be tested by Iridium in the weeks to come. After testing is complete the satellites will move into operational orbit at 780 km and begin providing service to Iridium customers, according toDiane Hockenberry, SpaceX director of corporate communications and public relations .</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They move the new satellite up beside the old satellite and basically we have cross links that allow you to read telemetry,” Hockenberry said. “So they turn those cross links on so they’re reading the connection to the other satellites and they become the operational satellites as they turn the old ones off.
