The pop-up store has operated since 1968 and is run entirely by artists who apply each year to have their work featured. On Dec. 3 from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. the store is hosting its annual event to mark the first Thursday of December, featuring live music, wine and appetizers and allowing customers to meet the artists.</p>\n<p>Susan Dunbar, the current manager of the store and former UCSB student, said what makes The Yes Store special is cooperation and the “legwork that nobody sees.”</p>\n<p>“For me it’s just amazing to see everybody pull together in a big group and make it happen,” Dunbar said. “‘Cause we typically only have a week or two to build the desk, get your booths in, stock it and then we open.”</p>\n<p>Dunbar, who first began working for the store after graduating college in 1981, said she appreciates watching multiple generations of Santa Barbara locals enjoy the store.</p>\n<p>“We’re unique in the way that we’ve been doing this for so long, so we see families grow up and come back and bring their children and buy art,” Dunbar said.</p>\n<p>The Yes Store employee Wendy Wagner said she tries to create a connection between shoppers and artists.</p>\n<p>“I’m a floor sales person but I consider myself an artist facilitator,” Wagner said. “I try to encourage people to know a little bit about the artists when they’re looking at their work so that that might help them purchasing their little treasures from these people.”</p>\n<p>Wagner said the store has undergone considerable expansion since last year and is always encouraging new artists to join.</p>\n<p>“We have 10 new artists this year so there’s a lot of new product in the store; we’re really excited about that,” Wagner said. “We like the expansion process, and, if any artists are interested in being in The Yes Store, we have a book that you can sign your name and then be notified next year when the jury process begins.”</p>\n<p>Long-time customer Stella Larson said she loves the quality of the store’s products, as well as being able to give back to the Santa Barbara art community.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been coming at least 42 years and I always look for my favourite people and then I look for the new people; it’s a wonderful thing. It’s all local artisans, everything is handmade — it’s really wonderful quality,” Larson said. “It helps the artist and it helps keep art going in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Local resident Trina Diaz said the store is well-known in the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>“I grew up here and it’s been going on forever,” Diaz said, “Locals all know about the [The] Yes Store so they look forward to it every year.”</p>\n<p>Diaz added that the store is a great opportunity for local artists to gain more exposure.</p>\n<p>“It’s a wonderful place for local artists to display their talent and for people to come and see that from all over the world,” Diaz said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/the-yes-store-hosts-annual-event-showcasing-artists/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/the-yes-store-hosts-annual-event-showcasing-artists/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/the-yes-store-hosts-annual-event-showcasing-artists/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/the-yes-store-hosts-annual-event-showcasing-artists/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/the-yes-store-hosts-annual-event-showcasing-artists/","id":3865,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[3864,3863,3862],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro","biography":"Not available","articles":[2621,2660,2664,2673,2677,2710,3865,4571,5867,6778,6944],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Maybe He Should Go Back to Sesame Street\nSunday, Oct. 7, 12:29 a.m. - Two deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw a man walking around the corner of an apartment complex while a seco...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Maybe He Should Go Back to Sesame Street<br>\nSunday, Oct. 7, 12:29 a.m. – Two deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw a man walking around the corner of an apartment complex while a second man played lookout so his companion could urinate.</p>\n<p>As the officers approached, the guard sounded the alarm, yelling repeatedly for his friend to stop peeing and zip up his pants.</p>\n<p>The word came too late and a deputy got to the pissing perpetrator before he even finished the task at hand.</p>\n<p>After the 19-year-old man finished, the officers took him to the curb, noticed a strong odor of alcohol and began questioning.</p>\n<p>The man told the officers that he was a student at Santa Barbara City College. The deputy told him that he himself was “a proud graduate of SBCC” and then asked the subject to repeat his ABC’s.</p>\n<p>The man did not seem to know the alphabet but happily repeated, “I’m from SBCC. I am a proud graduate.”</p>\n<p>He then told officers he lived at “R690” on “I.V. Cascadero. … Cascadero Estibero.”</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>14 Tequila, 15 Tequila, 16 Tequila… Sidewalk<br>\nThursday, Oct. 11, 10:52 a.m. – A deputy observed a 21-year-old man wobbling down Sabado Tarde Road when he stumbled on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>When he fell to the ground, a large half-empty bottle of Jose Cuervo flew out of his arms. Thankfully, it remained unbroken.</p>\n<p>The man’s lucky streak ended there, though, as the officer picked up and dumped out the tequila.</p>\n<p>The subject explained to the officer, “It’s okay for me to be drunk. I’m over 21.”</p>\n<p>Despite his age, the man was breaking two laws – possession of an open container of alcohol and obvious public intoxication – so the officer arrested him.</p>\n<p>While at the IVFP station waiting for transfer to jail, the man alternated between lying on the floor and sitting in the chair, apparently trying to find the most comfortable position.</p>\n<p>Soon the man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>I Would Walk 500 Miles… But Not with Her<br>\nThursday, Oct. 11, 12:40 a.m. – Officers standing on Camino del Sur observed a woman staggering northbound down the road, stumbling and walking into parked vehicles.</p>\n<p>An officer attempted to contact the 20-year-old woman, but she turned and ran away, but only for a brief moment. The fleeing fugitive managed to get less than half a block before the deputy detained her and placed her on the curb.</p>\n<p>During an intoxicating interrogation, the woman said she did not know where she lived and slurred out several incorrect addresses as she tried to identify her current location.</p>\n<p>While the woman said she had “nothing” to drink, she was uncooperative and combatant, and the deputy had to place her face down and cuff her.</p>\n<p>During the arrest, an unknown man, who was apparently a victim of the directionally challenged woman, thanked the officer for taking the loaded lady off his hands, saying, “We’ve been walking in circles for hours.”</p>\n<p>At the Isla Vista Foot Patrol station, an officer had to remove chairs from the booking room to keep her from climbing and stumbling over them.</p>\n<p>The woman was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Tourist Trap<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 13, 3:21 p.m. – A 20-year-old man was staggering around the 6500 block of DP, looking for Freebirds, when a deputy contacted him.</p>\n<p>The officer asked the man where he was going, to which the man replied, “I’m from San Diego, I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>He then appeared as if he were about to topple over, so the deputy grabbed his arm to keep him on his feet.</p>\n<p>The man then told the officer that he had no friends in “I.P.” and had had eight beers that afternoon.</p>\n<p>For the man’s safety, he was arrested for public intoxication. He was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-18/police-blotter-17/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-18/police-blotter-17/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-18/police-blotter-17/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-18/police-blotter-17/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-18/police-blotter-17/","id":3862,"author":{"id":266,"name":"Staff"},"related":[3861,3860,3859],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat, Nov. 3, 12:49 a.m. - Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed a man staggering down the street.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Sat, Nov. 3, 12:49 a.m. – Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive observed a man staggering down the street.</p>\n<p>The man lost his balance several times, falling to the ground, before standing up and trying again.</p>\n<p>As a deputy observed the man, he saw that the subject was about to fall and kindly ran to catch him. The officer then prepared to arrest him, noting that he was extremely intoxicated.</p>\n<p>As the 19-year-old man was taken into custody, he kept shouting at the arresting officer, “I’m not going to be in your fraternity!”</p>\n<p>The deputy informed the potential pledge that he was not affiliated with the greek system and arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The subject seemed upset that the incident was not a joke. He was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed… in a jail, not a frat house.</p>\n<p>When Alternate States of Sobriety Collide…<br>\nFriday, Oct. 26, 2:03 a.m. – Deputies patrolling the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road observed a man pounding on the front door of a residence.</p>\n<p>The officer watched the subject stumble over a bike, pick it up, drop it and pick it up again, apparently intent on stealing it.</p>\n<p>A resident emerged from the house and told the man to leave the bicycle alone, asking the officer for backup.</p>\n<p>The deputy contacted the alleged thief and began questioning him. The 19-year-old subject said that he was just looking for a place to party – perhaps at some Isla Vista bicycle bash.</p>\n<p>As questioning continued, the officer asked the man for his phone number and the subject replied, “San Diego.”</p>\n<p>The deputy then asked the man for his emergency contact information and the man said, “Single.”</p>\n<p>The officer then decided that the two were having completely different conversations, as the subject seemed to be filling out a Match.com survey rather than answering the questions. The deputy arrested the man for public intoxication. The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Trojans Never Learn…<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 27, 2:26 a.m. – On the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive, an officer walking by noticed a 20-year-old man sitting on a driveway, slumped forward with his back against a wall.</p>\n<p>The officer contacted him and noted that the man was unconscious. The deputy announced his presence and tapped the subject on shoulder three times before he spoke.</p>\n<p>Without looking at him, the man, who attends the University of Southern California, acknowledged the officer with a nod.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked the troubled Trojan if he was OK the man said, “yes,” and that he was just sleeping.</p>\n<p>When asked how much he had to drink, the wounded warrior admitted, “Quite a bit.”</p>\n<p>Forgetting to take a page from history, the man apparently got too drunk while surrounded by his enemies.</p>\n<p>The man said he thought he was in Los Angeles and did not even know how he got drunk.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked the man where his friends were, the man did not reply and instead vomited for several minutes on his hands and feet.</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was kept behind the fortress walls until he learned his lesson.</p>\n<p>Never Yell Your Phone Number to Strangers<br>\nSunday, Oct. 21, 2:41 a.m. – A woman was stumbling down the 6500 block of Seville Road, held up by an unknown man.</p>\n<p>An officer contacted the pair and asked the woman where she lived. The subject pointed and said, “Right there at 66 Seville.”</p>\n<p>The deputy duly noted that no such address exists in I.V., and decided to continue questioning the 19-year-old woman.</p>\n<p>When he asked the subject if she knew her companion, who was also intoxicated, she said she only knew his first name. The woman then apparently forgot how to pronounce her new friend’s name.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked her how much she had drank, the subject replied, “I don’t know… but it was a lot.”</p>\n<p>The woman was taken to I.V. Foot Patrol office, where the deputy continued questioning her. The woman repeatedly said that her phone number was “714-c-h-a-y.”</p>\n<p>She immediately fell asleep after questioning.</p>\n<p>The woman was woken up and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/","id":3863,"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore"},"related":[3862,3861,3860],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AB 935 To Allow Special Identification for Veterans","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/veteranID.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/veteranID.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Assembly Bill 935 took effect Friday, allowing United States military veterans to apply for a California driver’s license or identification card with a veteran designation.

The DMV requires veterans to pay a $5 application fee.</p>\n<p>According to California State Assemblymember Jim Frazier, who authored AB 935, the bill allows Californians to fulfill their “responsibility” of ensuring veterans are “well-equipped” for civilian life.</p>\n<p>“Assembly Bill 935 helps us fulfill that pledge to our veterans,” Frazier said in a statement. “Proof of military service is now literally at the individual’s fingertips, which will help ensure that California veterans are receiving all the benefits they’re rightfully entitled to.”</p>\n<p>U.S. Army veteran and engineering graduate student Paul Malone said this legislation frees veterans from needing to have DD-214 certificates on hand in order to enjoy benefits, which he said is a “dumb thing,” because the discharge certificate is a sensitive document, comparable to a birth certificate or Social Security card.</p>\n<p>“Most people carry their licenses with them, which makes this a common sense fix to a problem within our community, assuming it is honored as valid proof,” Malone said in an email.</p>\n<p>Malone said he worries that California lawmakers will “hang their hat” on veterans’ laws now that AB 935’s has passed.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot more to be done just to catch up to other states in terms of what they’re doing for veterans,” Malone said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB Veteran Resource Center counselor and religious studies graduate student Sam Reid said the new veteran license and ID is ultimately “not that big of a deal” for veterans like himself who already carry a United States Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) identification card.</p>\n<p>“If I already have the card, I don’t really need the indicator,” Reid said. “It’s a cool thing, but it’s not some revolutionary game-changer.”</p>\n<p>Reid said he will add the designation to his driver’s license the next time he renews his license at the DMV.</p>\n<p>“I will do that when I renew my license, but I won’t go out of my way,” Reid said.</p>\n<p>U.S. Navy veteran and Chican@ studies Ph.D. candidate Delores Mondragón said AB 935 will especially help female veterans.</p>\n<p>According to Mondragón, she and her husband once tried to get a free coffee at Starbucks on Veterans Day as part of a promotion, and an employee asked Mondragón for pictures of her in uniform, but did not ask her husband for the same.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s an important thing to have, especially for female veterans,” Mondragón said. “I think we have a much harder time being legitimized as veterans.”</p>\n<p>Mondragón also said female veterans are less likely carry alternate forms of identification offered by veteran organizations such as the V.A., the Veterans of Foreign Wars or the American Legion, as they often avoid these organizations because they are “saturated with men.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of women veterans don’t like to be around that many men anymore, especially if we’re the only ones amidst a thousand men,” Mondragón said.</p>\n<p>Mondragón said her biggest concern is that the DMV is charging veterans to apply to add the designation, which she said seems like a “profiteering” scheme.</p>\n<p>“They’re going to make a profit off of what we thought was inherently a necessity in our community,” Mondragón said. “You’re going to have all these veterans pay to let people know that they’re veterans. That’s the part that I just am in complete disagreement with — I think it should be free.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66515\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66515\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/ab-935-to-allow-special-identification-for-veterans/","id":3864,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[3863,3862,3861],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
