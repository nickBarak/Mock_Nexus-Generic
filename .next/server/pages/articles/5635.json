I went to a 50 percent white school system on the border of two rich suburbs where most of my friends lived. Until I was about 15, I truly believed I fit right in with my surroundings. However, things started to change as I grew older and became aware of the uniqueness of my situation. I was one of the few in my friend group who had been followed by workers in grocery stores, randomly searched at airports and been the target of racist statements. Although my classmates may have viewed these remarks as innocent jokes, I believe they promoted toxic beliefs about my own identity. What bothered me more was that not only did my classmates think it was okay to make these comments, but expected me to brush them off. When I expressed my discomfort, I was accused of “being sensitive” or “acting like a pussy.” I had grown up with these people, shared experiences with them. Why would I find these comments offensive if they didn’t?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It kind of made sense, didn’t it? My skin was relatively fair for a brown kid. I benefited from an above-average public school system and never really had to worry about money at home growing up. I never learned Farsi and couldn’t participate in many of the family conversations on my dad’s side, while my Spanish three-level vocabulary left much to be desired on my mom’s side. I had not immigrated to the country by myself as my dad did at 14, and I was never forced to drop out of school and join the army like my Mexican grandpa did to gain American citizenship. My family did an incredible job creating opportunities for me, and due to this, I felt I could not fully relate to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It felt as if I was in this complex, overlapping Venn diagram in which I somehow ended up in a category all by myself in the middle. I was too privileged to identify with my family and too brown to assimilate into the environment afforded by my friends at school. I could sense the disappointment in my extended Iranian family’s faces when I informed them I couldn’t speak Farsi. According to my mom, my first name was almost Pablo, yet I could sense the confusion on my opponent’s face when I used Spanish on the soccer field when we played a predominantly Latino team. Gaining full acceptance without alienating the other half of me was not something I was going to achieve. Growing up I only really had to worry about my grades, girls and soccer and I felt extremely guilty about it. Guilty that I had simply settled with not immersing myself in the worlds my separate environments provided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I still kind of do to this day. It’s not something I can fix or change. It’s how I grew up, it’s part of my identity. I am never going to fit the typical profile of either of my cultures, and accepting that was the first step to feeling okay about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In American culture, there seems to be conflicting expectations regarding the conduct of minorities, especially for mixed-race populations. The authenticity of President Obama’s blackness was constantly questioned due to his white mother, yet he was held to arguably the highest standards any American president has had to face due to his skin. Critics of Colin Kaepernick have repeatedly called his movement and its message invalid due to the fact that he was adopted by a white family during his childhood, yet he still finds himself blackballed by the NFL more than two years later. There seems to be a switch the American majority can choose to flip whenever the situation calls for it. Whatever side of you that fits their narrative is the one that is going to be highlighted to match the current agenda. It’s why growing up people from school felt they could make racist jokes at my expense and question my Latino heritage due to “not speaking Mexican” the next (I could go into the problematic racial implications of that statement all day, but that’s a tangent for another time).</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It felt as if I was in this complex, overlapping Venn diagram in which I somehow ended up in a category all by myself in the middle.

There was very little, if any, representation in media that could have provided a blueprint for how to conduct myself growing up as mixed-race individual in American society, much less as a growing Mexican-Iranian man. Not one show. Not one famous athlete. I eventually realized that I was one of the first people to grow up on this frontline of mixed-race America. When I was 16, that kind of terrified me. As I grew older and began to understand the racial transition in which this country is going through, I’ve realized that people like me will represent a normal occurrence in society. At 21, this realization that used to frighten me is now almost exciting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can count the number of Iranian-Mexican people I’ve met in my life on one hand, and two of them are my cousins. Yet America is changing, whether the old white people like it or not. More of me will come, and soon America will live up to the “melting pot” name with which it so exuberantly brands itself. I am a mix of two minorities, yet I have opportunities that are simply not granted easily to people who share either of my identities. My authenticity may always be questioned, and probably for good reasons. I am not my ancestors, I have not lived their lives. I am not them. But it’s important I take the advantages I’ve been given and the future platforms of expression that I may receive. My family didn’t work this hard for me to be stuck in some box you check on a census. How else will this country move forward if minorities are continually hit with some sort of excuse for their success when they break the barriers built by years of systemic suppression? Just because I can’t be easily categorized doesn’t mean I don’t have to live the rest of my life with an asterisk next to it. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Karamdashti is starting to become content with being an outlier.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2019-02-20-at-9.56.21-AM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kiank/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kian Karamdashti</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kian Karamdashti is an Opinion and Nexustentialism staff writer.

Today, trendiness is no longer measured by the number of likes on your avocado toast pictures and hyper-posed selfies but instead by the relatability of your content. Realism has replaced aspiration. Recently, sites like Instagram and Pornhub champion content creators who’ve managed to perfect this amateur aesthetic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through ad revenue, brand deals and sponsorships, “influencing” has established itself beyond Gen Z speak, garnering attention as a legitimate — and highly lucrative — career. These revenue streams exist not only on YouTube, Instagram and other social media giants but in adult entertainment as well. Being an influencer is equal to being a modern-day entrepreneur. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undeniably, one of the titans in the new wave of mainstream pornography is Pornhub. Conservative estimates value the the porn industry at </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/16/mia-khalifa-is-among-worlds-most-watched-women-yet-porn-industry-is-keeping-profits/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">around $2 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, due in part to porn’s stigma and the secretiveness surrounding the industry. Less conservative estimates stipulate that porn generates more annual revenue than both the NFL and Netflix. With these monster profits, the porn industry directs the spotlight toward pornography’s creators, who are no longer puppeted by major corporations and studios. Instead, business is created and managed by the film stars themselves. This shift in the porn business model has enabled anyone to become an adult-film star overnight.

People not only watch porn but feel just as invested in the lives of amateur porn stars as they do with their favorite influencers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Pornhub celebrated the 10th anniversary of their </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtissilver/2018/11/20/pornhubs-model-program-has-paid-out-millions-defining-a-new-type-of-influencer/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Model Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which hosts over a hundred thousand amateurs on their site. </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/islasummer_?lang=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Summer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is just one of them. The account is run by a young, college-aged couple in the Isla Vista community. After creating their account and posting their first video over spring break this past school year, they’ve become a household name among the community, with their content having been featured on Pornhub’s home page multiple times. To date, their account has received 20.2 million views and counting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Summer’s popularity is due to the recent demand for amateur porn coupled with their ability to strategize as influencers: They’re curating content that their audience wants to see. Summer, who wishes to remain anonymous, explained that “most of them are very absurd concepts and simple, easy-to-follow but absurd storylines,” because “it just catches the eye when you see that type of title online. You just have to click it.” They added that their “most popular video is where me playing 2K is the main focus of it.” The brand they’ve created — young, attractive and, most importantly, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> college students — is not the only reason they’ve been hugely successful; it’s also because they are aware of their brand and viewership and have utilized the amateur aesthetic to their advantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Featuring shots of the UCSB Library and local places in Santa Barbara, their content is starkly different from the manufactured look of a studio-produced film. </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444810362853\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the meaning of amateurism in porn, Susanna Paasonen discusses why amateur work’s higher sense of realism is attractive to consumers. It’s because amateurism is about mimicking reality: it’s truthful. While the ring lights of a professional studio and glamorous facades used to dominate the porn industry, it’s now all about the opposite. People want to see representations of sexual acts as truthful and authentic — the imperfect bodies and blemishes that make it feel, as one consumer of porn puts it, “like you’re in that setting or you’re that person.” This increased interest in involving the audience is the most crucial aspect of creating content that is both real and relatable, and above all, what young audiences want to see — whether it comes to amateur pornography or Instagram models. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being unfiltered is the new status quo. As Summer puts it: “People expect our lives to be, like, wildly different now, because they view us as porn stars but we’re exactly the same.” It’s this sameness that has launched them into fame. It is this transparency, in a clandestine industry, that blurs the lines between consumer and creator, average joe and porn star, which has established amateurism as culturally significant.<br>\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increased interest in involving the audience is the most crucial aspect of creating content that is both real and relatable, and above all, what young audiences want to see — whether it comes to amateur pornography or Instagram models. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monetary value of relatability is mirrored in other influencer industries. Take Emma Chamberlain, an 18-year old high school dropout turned multimillionaire business mogul. Her minimalistic, carefree aesthetic sets her apart from the hyper-produced, staged look that is popular among big YouTubers like Jake Paul and Bethany Mota. With 8.53 million YouTube subscribers in just under two years, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her channel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and record-setting rise to fame are evidence of how the pendulum of popularity has drastically swung in relability’s favor. Her editing style, filled with frequent jump cuts and superzooms, reflects the “quirky girl” personality that has earned her millions of followers. Her content production’s lack of professionalism and willingness to embrace her suburban American roots are qualities with which fans clearly engage and relate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On social media, Chamberlain frequently pokes fun at herself. Her fans say, “Unlike those other YouTubers living in mansions with perfect hair and expensive clothes, she’s just an average teen.” Identically, Isla Summer’s “average teen-ness” is a huge point of profit. More and more, it seems, the value and impact of an influencer can be measured by how accessible they are to their audience. The commodity is no longer the aspirational value; it is the personality, and most importantly, the person or people behind the camera. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kim Kardashian and her family may be the best example of this. Her sex tape — the trailer, a six-minute preview leaked in 2007 — still holds its title as </span><a href=\"https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2018-year-in-review\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pornhub’s most watched video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of all time. It is undeniable that her rise to fame and multibillion dollar empire and influencer career stemmed from the film’s release. Whether it was leaked or not — which is still widely debated — the Kardashian family revolutionized the idea of the celebrity, capitalizing on the transition from the public to private sphere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to Kardashian, the idea of a celebrity was no longer an untouchable, aspirational figure, seen on Photoshopped magazine covers and commercials, but a personalized, profitable brand that highlighted the creator’s relatability. The influencers of today owe it to the Kardashians for creating an industry career out of thin air. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just feel like I’m hanging out with my friends. My camera is my friend,” said </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiM8OI8ySYAoealLy-YRCbg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summer McKeen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of Chamberlain’s friends and an influencer in her own right. At the heart of influencing is the connection with a fanbase that pays for the glorified influencer’s career and lifestyle under the guise of realism, as if you too can be friends with Kim — only after paying for her new contour palette. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The popularity of realism in porn, it seems, is not an isolated event: The culture has shifted, the tide has changed and content creators like Chamberlain and Isla Summer are leaders of this creative counterculture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily vlogs, “day in the life”-style videos that are popular on YouTube, can be viewed as parallel to Pornhub’s Model Program, which has the same objective: increase the consumer’s access to the creator. </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/double3xposure/?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reese Blutstein</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a 22-year-old influencer with a quarter of a million followers, puts it simply: “For my generation, people are more willing to be who they are and not make up a fake identity,” she said. “We are trying to show a real person doing cool things as a real person, not trying to create a persona that isn’t actually you.” This candidness and creator-to-consumer relationship is then monetized for profit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of Pornhub’s Model Program, creators like Isla Summer can offer exclusive, customizable video and photo content, as well as profit from private conversations and texting via Snapchat. This direct-to-consumer distribution method is the reason why Summer said, “In terms of the ad revenue perspective, you get taken care of pretty well being on one of the biggest websites in the world.” It’s all about “trying to get as many eyeballs to see your link as possible, because the more people that click your link, the more advertisers want to use your link to put up their ads.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The couple went into further detail regarding the ease with which they started their career on Pornhub, saying, “It was so easy. Literally, all we had to do was send them pictures of our IDs and a couple of pictures to verify that we were actually in possession of this account.” Making porn, to Isla Summer, was not with the intention of becoming the next Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee. It was about earning an income, as is the objective of nearly all other content creators. The stigma surrounding porn wasn’t evident at all in Isla Summer’s comments or demeanor. As content creators, the sexual element is removed from their titles, with their focus devoted to reaping the benefits of the cash cow that is amateur porn. “Until the internet as we know it dies, this is gonna keep making us more and more money, so we’re just going to try to keep doing what we’re doing,” Summer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overlaps between mainstream influencer culture and amateur pornography are becoming more and more frequent. In the premier of the new season of the YouTube show “</span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-reality-house-show-trisha-paytas-elijah-daniel-contestants-2019-7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reality House</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” a reality competition show in the same vein as “Big Brother,” </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/KianAndJc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian and Jc</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two big names in the YouTube world, welcomed internet personality and amateur pornstar </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEFuuAUSHlQzHMres7AD38Q\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lena The Plug</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into the new cast. Lena The Plug was also nominated for Top Celebrity at the</span><a href=\"https://www.pornhub.com/awards/nominees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2019 Pornhub Awards</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, along with </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClWD8su9Sk6GzZDwy9zs3_w\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tana Mongeau</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cardi B, Kim Kardashian and Stormy Daniels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the technological revolution came the graduation of porn from magazines and VCRs to our phones, just a finger tap away. Today, porn occupies the public, private and even political domain. However the monetization of realism, while economically lucrative and seemingly innocent, is concerning. Without being critical of our content, it’s easy to be unable to decipher when a photo or video has gone through rounds of editing or seen the desks of producers and managers when it’s posed — and branded — as organic. The amateur aesthetic is dangerous in deceiving its audiences and arguably equally as dangerous as the blatant Photoshop fails and hyper-edited magazine covers. Where professionalism connotes skill and quality, amateurism embodies spontaneity and truthfulness. However, both are representations of reality that have been deliberately manufactured.

But outside, nicotine fuels an entirely different world. Just outside Davidson library, oceanside, is a small smoking area where gatherings of students rejoice quietly in the sweet relief of nicotine, sheltered by an enclave of coral trees. The smoking area is dotted with Chinese international students chain smoking, draped in all of their Gucci glory, softly chatting in Mandarin as the glow of their cigarettes burn through 2 a.m.</p>\n<p>I’m addicted to walking by the smoking area. The wafer-thin wisps of tobacco smoke are pungent with memories of my childhood. As I overhear bits and pieces of Mandarin in the overlapping conversation, I’m overwhelmed with the searing image of my uncles’ Zhonghua cigarette packs, red and gold, spinning on the Lazy Susan as they threw back another tiny thimble of sorghum liquor at dinner. “Another toast!” they’d say. “Gānbēi!”</p>\n<p>My formative years were spent in Dalian, China — a seaside city where the skies were a perpetual lovely yellow color — at a time when I didn’t know the English alphabet. It was a time when my Mandarin was fluent, I did not know Cheetos existed and my classmates and I wore little, red scarves to elementary school as a promise of our allegiance to the Party. The back of my first grade classroom was graced by a small framed image of Mao Zedong, and I spent summers learning brush calligraphy. I drank hot water, not iced; I watched soap operas about the glory of the Tang dynasty and idolized Zhang Ziyi. My grandmother even found me a ping pong coach.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false;

I rejected parts of my culture that weren’t so palatable to white suburbia, understanding that the price of white acceptance was to conform to their criticisms of my identity. I stopped eating chicken feet, I pretended not to hear accusations that I had an unfair advantage in math class and I internalized the colorblind racism that seemed to be the backbone of country club civilization. Privilege shielded me from certain truths about my identity in America that I could not understand until I escaped childhood.</p>\n<p>To be an East Asian-American is to bear the burden of the model minority myth in exchange for privileges of American colorism, to participate in society as quasi-white. In some ways, I even benefit from the constant fetishization of my body; I welcome the hypersexualization of the ‘Orient’ if my desirability harbors me from white hate. The constant worry that my partner likes me for the color of my skin is bearable background noise to the atrocities that other marginalized groups in America suffer at the hands of white supremacy. I live like a sheep in acceptance of my oppression because “it could be worse.”</p>\n<p>Today, my unfortunate preference for white men suggests that my assimilation to American culture is all but irreversible and complete while my faithful devotion to Confucian filial piety suggests the opposite. Was I born Chinese or was I born an American citizen? I struggled to answer this age-old question of nature or nurture, fearing that choosing one would invalidate the other. Hyphenated-American feels like a betrayal to both sides of my identity, belittling both my ethnic heritage and my right to an equal place in American society. I feel like Schrödinger’s cat, supposedly American or Chinese, simultaneously both and neither.</p>\n<p>So this summer, I made a three-month pilgrimage, a repatriation to the Motherland. It had been 10 years since I was last in China, 10 years since I last saw the people and the home I had left behind. Surely we had grown apart. When my plane landed in Beijing in the middle of blistering June, I was immediately surrounded by swarming crowds of people who looked like me. From luggage claim to customs were all black-haired, almond-eyed, yellow-skinned people. At the company I worked at, we used WeChat instead of email and Didi instead of Uber. I enthusiastically huffed in my boss’s cigarette smoke as she smoked her skinny mint menthol Esse’s. Submerged in a rich, homogenous soup of my culture at its purest, I revelled in the feeling of true belonging for the first time since my childhood. This must be what it feels like to be white in America.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Privilege shielded me from certain truths about my identity in America that I could not understand until I escaped childhood.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Chinese friends I made at work welcomed me without second thought. Many fellow interns were “sea turtles,” international students studying in England and the U.S., while others had spent their entire lives in China. They were excited to meet an American who spoke Mandarin fluently. I spent my weekends with them as they showed me everything that had changed within the last 10 years I spent away from China, everything they had grown up with that I had not. The glory of modern China defeats all expectations. The impossibly low cost of labor ensures that after dividing every RMB price by six to convert to the dollar, every luxury suddenly became accessible.</p>\n<p>I felt intense waves of guilt as I enjoyed each freedom the powerful dollar allowed, but to my nouveau-riche colleagues, this lifestyle was to be expected. The wealth disparity was welcomed. It made for fierce competition; I was told it is the reason why I seemed to love almost everything in China. Case in point, I failed to eat an unsatisfactory meal while in the Motherland. Hot pot, barbeque, homestyle cooking and street food that I had eaten in the States for the past 10 years were weak imitations of the real deal. Perhaps the most important experience of my life was waiting in a two-hour line in Chengdu and missing my bullet train so I could devour a bowl of red-oil wontons inside some grandma’s first floor apartment. Even Kentucky Fried Chicken is transformed beyond perfection in China: perfect pastel de natas, lightly battered shrimp and the flawless execution of an American-style chicken that defined succulence.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was American of me to fall so madly in love with China, to see its good and look past its faults, to enjoy its mastery of pork and to forget its human rights abuses. I slurped on noodle soup made by Uighur cooks. I chugged Tibetan yak butter tea. I participated in capitalism with vigor and consumed its unethical fruits, all while not feeling particularly homesick for the U.S. My summer, in its retellings, appears glorified and unblemished. I wonder if I was more tourist than local, more propaganda than reality.</p>\n<p>My colleagues told me that Americans stride with unreasonable confidence. Perhaps because of this ego, it’s obvious I am American. Street vendors knew to approach me in English and I was easily swindled for reasons beyond my naiveté. I did not join my female colleagues’ constant war against the sun as they opened their umbrellas in broad, dry daylight to shield UV rays. While I gladly ate every iteration of offal, I refused to take the constant dieting advice from strangers. Was it wrong to pick and choose the parts of my culture that I loved? Maybe. Perhaps then it would be fair to categorize my love for China as appropriation: Was I so foreign that I could warrant such a label? For too long, I had envisioned a perfect home without questioning if it still had room for me.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, this home had room for people who identified as expats. China’s cities are full of cop-outs for such people. Coffee shops and bars are remodeled with non-squatting toilets and full English menus to simulate American spaces. The time I spent in the Sanlitun district in Beijing is a near perfect reflection of my identity crisis as I ate hot wings with Ivy League white boys and other American-born Chinese. To the excitement of my coworkers, I could navigate both spaces with similar ease. They wanted to know if I’d date white men back home and would tell me how beautiful my babies would be if they were mixed. I think of the hell that mixed-race Asian Americans go through, their genetic expression a visual representation of the hyphenated-American experience as they face ostracization and fetishization all at once. I guess my only hope is that my children can speak to their grandma in Chinese, I tell them, knowing full-well it’s almost set in stone that in my late-twenties, I will probably marry some white boy who listens to too much indie rock.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Maybe it was American of me to fall so madly in love with China, to see its good and look past its faults, to enjoy its mastery of pork and to forget its human rights abuses.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My coworkers’ question came from a place of hope and love: For them, America is the dreamland, the prized visa, the answer to all of China’s troubles. For me, the answer is China: I continually fail to see beyond my privilege, beyond my First Amendment rights and the salvation that is my navy-blue passport. I feel nourished by the land and by the food my people had perfected over millennia. Mine is a stupid, primitive, tribal reaction akin to seeing long-lost family. I look to China and see the warm embrace of 1.4 billion people who look like me, look like my mother and my mother’s mother, people whose ancestors fought in wars with mine, who lived through dynasties with mine, and I wonder if my deep love for China is a nod of forgiveness to all of its wrongdoings. In a selfish way, I saw hope from China.</p>\n<p>I had always believed that I could claim my land and culture based on some predestined ethnic right. My dissatisfaction with the in-between space for Chinese Americans could not justify the blatant ignorance of my class privilege. To be the child of Chinese immigrants means to enjoy inherent privileges and opportunities; to afford the experience of repatriation this summer is a privilege; to go and leave as I pleased across borders and firewalls was an immeasurable exercise of power. I reaped power from the in-between space that I so resented, forgetting that my love for China was a decision, while the people of China had no alternatives. Patriotism, which I had rejected so vehemently in the U.S., was not a choice for my Chinese family and friends. I could never be qualified to call myself Chinese without living through the evils and flaws of the country I so loved. The loss of certain human rights was a sacrifice I couldn’t make: my mother made that decision for me when she immigrated to the U.S. The age-old question of nature or nurture was finally answered: I was born different.</p>\n<p>When I walk past the cigarette soirée after another fruitless night at Davidson, I breathe in deep. The tobacco smoke is Beijing smog; it is my love for China and its people, my people— it is me and my pursuit of home. While I continue to long for that home, it’s time for me to make peace with the in-between space. And when Chinese international students continue to talk to me in English during lecture while I continue to respond in Mandarin, I can remind myself of cigarette smoke.</p>\n<p><i>Katherine Chen wants her fellow Chinese Americans to eat chicken feet and text their moms back on WeChat. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/005032bf5c4274525514364f5a134dd3?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katchen/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Chen</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kat Chen is an Opinion staff writer.

Unlike most kids running carefree through toy stores, panic paralyzed me as dinnertime, my cue to leave the store, inched closer. Sitting beside me, my dad put his hand on my back as I sat between stuffed animals. Each one had their own backstory, name and future adventure brimming on the horizon, but I could only take one home. For 30 whole minutes, my brain rattled with indecision. My fear of making the wrong choice ignited my anxiety, giving it a life force off of which to feed. Now, in a world flipped upside down by a pandemic, I continue to face tough choices as if I had never left that toy store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, instead of having to choose between two equally cute stuffed animals, now I find myself having to choose between an apartment and my parents’ house. Locked in contracts after what turned out to be a brief flirtation with independence, many college students are continuing to pay their leases while regressing on their parents’ couches. When faced with today’s housing conundrum, having to choose between remaining here or going “home,” I was confronted by the seemingly easy question of how to live. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running through my daydreams, both while I’m in Isla Vista and away, I wonder what really is the right decision. Is it right or selfish to stay in I.V.? At home, my body sinks when I picture the money I’m wasting, but at school, I imagine myself craving family. In truth, neither answer is what’s “right.” After hours of fierce debate with myself, I’ve come to accept that in these times, the world is unstable and none of us should judge or compare where we go or how we cope.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone all too familiar with indecision, I came up with this list of factors to help me figure out where it’s healthiest for me to live. And most importantly, a way to remember that there is no generic answer for knowing how to live happily and well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is first paramount to prioritize your own mental and physical safety. Families can stick together in a crisis, but that’s not necessarily true for everyone. There are many people who can’t go home because their loved ones are on the front lines, home is unwelcoming or because they have already settled in Santa Barbara. If you have an unstable relationship with your former guardians, going home can hurt more than it can help. In these already difficult times, think about yourself. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After hours of fierce debate with myself, I’ve come to accept that in these times, the world is unstable and none of us should judge or compare where we go or how we cope.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, it’s not selfish to live out your lease if leaving is better for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">others</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but not for you. In times of trouble, there’s an expectation to gravitate homeward, but deciding to stay in your Isla Vista home, with your Isla Vista family, can be the best choice. Everyone should be with their preferred support system. Your priority should be to get through your assignments without compromising your mental health. Conversely, if staying in Isla Vista would do you more harm than good, then don’t think of leaving as “wasting money.” If your family home is where it’s safest, then don’t hesitate to go. While it’s difficult, carrying guilt over seemingly wasted money shouldn’t be your responsibility right now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also important to remember that money isn’t everything. None of us could have seen this coming. So while it’s easier said than done, don’t beat yourself up about whatever decision you make. The impact of COVID-19 will reshape how all future rent contracts work, but today, we’re already locked into pre-virus clauses. If that money is lost, remember that if the world wasn’t upside down, your I.V. home would be housing you. If the only reason you’re in I.V. is to justify your rent, please know that going home isn’t a defeat. Money will always matter, especially to those without much of it, but you matter as well. It’s better to prioritize your comfort, safety and sanity over saving on rent.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing in that vein, trust yourself, no matter what your decision is. Amid this chaos, our lives remain our own. I compare myself to others all of the time. I look at people working more, in different fields or who are learning new skills, and wonder if my differences and lack of success make me less than. Have I made the wrong decisions? Where did I go wrong? Hearing about other people’s living choices during this pandemic has also left me in a state of fear. What do they know that I don’t? I haven’t shut down these thoughts, but I’ve learned to push them to the side, allowing them only to linger softly in the background of my mind like elevator music. We coexist, and in searching for my own confidence, I’ve learned to accept that I’ll never know if what I’m doing is right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being told what to do feels horrible, as if I’ve been deemed incapable. In the end, we are the only people who know, or can guess, what’s best for ourselves. And as such, no one should judge others for whatever living situation they choose. It’s difficult, but after sitting down and thinking about what </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need, listen to what that little voice inside you says. In retrospect, I may regret what I choose, but like with the stuffed animal I left behind, it’s best to remember that we’re all only acting with the information that we have. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Morley is one confused third-year student who wishes everyone the best of health (especially to those on the front lines).</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-4/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-4/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-4/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-4/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-4/","id":5634,"author":{"id":801,"name":"Hannah Morley"},"related":[5633,5632,5631],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
