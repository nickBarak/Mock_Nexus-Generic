The show will be held at 6610 Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>FIND MEANING IN GLEANING </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re like me, you’ve never heard the term gleaning before; gleaning is a term that means picking produce from harvest that would otherwise be unpicked and perish. Join Zero Waste Committee, FoodCycling and Environmental Affairs Board for their first gleaning event of the quarter this Saturday from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. They will be taking students to glean in the Montecito community. Carpooling will be arranged. Those interested can sign up at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/UCSBGleaning\">tinyurl.com/UCSBGleaning</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>HELP THE HOMELESS</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you need community service hours or just want to help out those around you, head to the El Dorado community lounge this Saturday morning at 9:30 a.m. The University Undergrad Apartments will be putting together care packages for houseless individuals.

Depending on conditions, there may even be a natural waterslide, WHAT????!!!! Organizers ask that those interested in participating fill out a short Google form that can be found on the event page. Go have fun!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>YA LIKE BRUNCH? YA LIKE YOGA?</strong></p>\n<p>Grab your yoga mat and head over to the Isla Vista Food Cooperative at 9:45 a.m. this Sunday for their monthly event, Beach Brunch Yoga. The event includes an hour-long yoga class on the bluffs overlooking the ocean followed by a light brunch. This month, the brunch will be set up as a “build a bowl” where participants can create an açai bowl with granola and superfood toppings. The brunch theme will vary each month of the year. Participants must pay a $5 fee at the Co-Op from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. any day before the event to sign up.

As early as winter break, students are advised to start thinking about housing and discussing budget with their parents/guardians as appropriate, to determine what would be the best fit for them. Students looking for housing should plan to attend one of the “Housing 101” programs that are offered by University &amp; Community Housing Services (UCHS) in various residence halls during winter quarter. These programs thoroughly cover university-owned and privately-owned community housing options, including deadlines, processes, types of leases, choosing a space and choosing roommates. </span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Begin figuring out who you would like to live with in October. The earlier you start looking the better. Most people find what they are looking for during December, but options remain later on. Smaller places such as one-bedroom apartments get taken up first while larger houses are on the market longer. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What are my housing options (university vs. I.V.)? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For university-owned housing, current first-year students are guaranteed a space in the residence halls; current third-year and fourth-year students also have the option of university-owned apartments, which are guaranteed if they lived in the residence halls for their first two years and they meet the deadlines. For privately-owned options in the community, including Isla Vista, students can access the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for available housing and should plan to attend one of the UCHS Rental Fairs on campus that bring property management companies together with prospective residents.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university offers living arrangements both on and off campus. There are university apartments specifically for upperclassmen and graduate students. Isla Vista also offers many housing options. Both houses and apartments are up for rent. Several co-op houses exist in I.V. as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>How late is too late to look for housing? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s never too late! However, the longer you put it off, the fewer options you will have. There are always options, but you may not find exactly what you are looking for. Looking by December/January just gives the widest range of options.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Is there a best area in I.V. to rent (a.k.a., where to get most of your money)? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It depends on what you are looking for. Typically, the closer a house is to the ocean (Del Playa, Sabado Tarde) the more expensive it will be. Houses closest to campus may also be a bit pricier. However, pricing varies from house to house and depending on the management company. More expensive houses may also offer more amenities and features.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>When do leases in I.V. typically start and end?</b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most leases are from June to June with leases starting at the end of the month and ending shortly after spring finals. Other leases may start in July or even in September before the start of the regular school year. Most leases take place over a 12-month period. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t have anyone in mind to live with? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In university-owned housing, students self-assign themselves into an available vacant space; the other spaces in the room/apartment are filled in by other continuing students through the same self-assignment process or by new incoming students during the summer. For privately-owned community options, students can utilize the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to list themselves as a ‘Roommate Available’ and can also browse through listings of other students who are looking to fill a space in their unit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University housing and many property management companies offer individual contracts for units, meaning you can find housing on your own and you won’t be responsible if one of your roommates leaves the unit. But if you still want to find friends to live with, be sure that you work as roommates. The people you party with may not be ideal to live with. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Editor’s Note</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Additionally, if you’re interested in living in Isla Vista but don’t have people in mind to live with, or are going abroad and will only be in I.V. for one or two quarters, many students post in the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/364409110289576/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Housing Facebook group</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to look for additional people to add onto their lease or for subleasers during the summer or the school year. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t want to live in I.V.? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also options in Goleta and Santa Barbara on the </span><a href=\"https://rentallistings.housing.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS Rental Listing Service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University housing is the most common alternative though some students choose to live in Goleta. Keep in mind the longer commute and greater distance from the student community. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What are the university-owned apartments like? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pictures, maps, floorspace plans and virtual tours of the </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/residences\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">university-owned apartments are available online here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>When can I apply for UCSB housing as a second, third or fourth year? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing students can find </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/contracts/continuing-students-undergraduate\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application deadlines for university-owned housing here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What should I do before I sign my lease? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students should visit the UCHS office upstairs in the University Center if they would like to have their privately-owned apartment lease reviewed. It is recommended that roommate groups go over the lease together to come up with questions before visiting the UCHS office for review.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask to see the unit in person. Make sure the unit has everything you’re looking for. Spend some time talking to the property managers and develop a relationship. Discuss any parts of the lease needing clarification. Be sure that all your prospective housemates are on board and understand the terms of the lease. Some also find it useful to ask current or previous tenants their experiences living in the unit. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What if I don’t have a parent to co-sign with me? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students without a co-signer may have different options depending on the management company and who their prospective roommates are. A student without a co-signer can have a roommate’s parent/guardian co-sign for them if they are willing to do so. If that is not an option, the student without a co-signer can talk to the management company to see if they would be willing to increase the security deposit in lieu of the co-signer.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some landlords require students to have a parent co-sign. But usually as long as you can prove your income and ability to pay rent, a parent co-sign is not needed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><b>What are my rights as a tenant? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCHS has a </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/student-success-guide\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Success Guide online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that goes over tenants’ rights and responsibilities.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What happens if I have a dispute with my landlord over my security deposit? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students with security deposit disputes can be assisted by UCHS. To avoid disputes, it is HIGHLY recommended that tenants have a move-in and move-out video in order to protect their deposit. For a small fee, UCHS will video the condition of the unit before move-in to document any pre-existing damages and then again at move-out to detail the condition of the unit at the end.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) offers counseling to anyone having a dispute with their landlord including over security deposits! IVTU’s office is on the second floor of Pardall Center. Come by between 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. for free service to UCSB students. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>What happens if I want to terminate a lease early? </b></p>\n<p><b>UCSB Housing Office: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For privately-owned accommodations in the community, tenants generally need to find a replacement and pay a lease transfer fee in order to terminate their lease early. For university-owned housing, residents also need to find an eligible replacement, unless they cease to be a UCSB student, in which case their lease would likely be terminated.</span></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terminating a lease early can be tricky. The most important thing is to make your landlord aware of your situation. You may be required to find a replacement tenant or continue paying if you leave the home. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>How does subleasing work? </b></p>\n<p><b>Isla Vista Tenants Union: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you won’t be living at your home for more than a few weeks such as during the summer term or looking for somewhere to live without being a primary tenant, you may want to consider subletting. Many online communities specialize in connecting people looking to sublet to those looking for this type of living arrangement. Landlords have the right to not allow subletting. The landlord may first want to screen the person subletting before allowing the arrangement. From then it depends on your situation whether the person subletting pays rent directly to the landlord or to the main tenant. Be sure which amenities will be provided to the person subletting such as a mattress or other furniture.   </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 9, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91901\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91901\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/91901/","id":4290,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[4289,4288,4287],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vistans Would Pay $30 a Year for New Tax Promising to Fund I.V.

The tax would add an additional 8 percent surcharge to five utilities on I.V. residents’ bills: electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services.</p>\n<p>In a report presented at a special meeting on Tuesday, the Community Services District (CSD) presented its first revenue projections. The CSD arrived at the figures by calculating eight percent of all I.V. bills in 2017 for the five utilities.</p>\n<p>Dividing that amount by the number of I.V. residents, 23,096 <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/islavistacdpcalifornia/PST045217\">according to the 2010 census</a>, means that individuals will each have to pay approximately $30.41 annually.</p>\n<p>The tax figures originally projected the CSD would accrue $834,993, though additional deductions the CSD is still considering would drop the number to $702,444.</p>\n<p>There are two specific deductions the CSD is considering: a state-owned exemption which amounts to $7,300 and a low-income exemption which totals $125,249 of tax savings for residents.</p>\n<p>A low-income exemption would excuse residents from paying the 8 percent tax on gas, water and electricity.</p>\n<p>Residents would be able to qualify for the exemption by providing proof they are enrolled in the California Alternate Rates for Energy or Family Electric Rate Assistance programs. They would also need proof they own the electricity utility account enrolled in the assistance program.</p>\n<p>In order to apply for the exemption, residents would have to file an application with the general manager of the CSD.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://sbcassessor.com/SampleballotandpollplaceLookup/ballots/bt000009.pdf\">the language readers will see at the </a>voting booth, the tax revenue will be used to fund “local improvements to parking, public safety, lighting, and sidewalks.”</p>\n<p>The language also states that the funds will be used to provide tenant-landlord mediation services, create a municipal advisory council and operate community facilities and events such as the I.V. Community Room at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar or the I.V. Community Center, both of which are behind Naan Stop.</p>\n<p>The ballot language originally claimed that the tax would accrue $642,000 in funds a year, though the CSD’s preliminary estimate is higher.<strong>  </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82998\" style=\"width: 1008px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1237702627\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83018\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82998\" data-attachment-id=\"82998\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/isla-vistans-would-pay-30-a-year-for-new-tax-promising-to-fund-i-v-services/measure-r/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=998%2C324&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"998,324\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure r\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=250%2C81&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?fit=888%2C288&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82998\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=888%2C288\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=250%2C81&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/measure-r.png?resize=768%2C249&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Above, a summary of the Isla Vista Community Services District’s revenue sources from the CSD’s Tuesday special meeting report.

And, as a starter, the sophomore has been even better, allowing just seven earned runs in five starts with two of those being wins.</p>\n<p>Even before coming to UCSB, Lincoln was a highly touted recruit that was selected in the 13th round of the MLB draft by the Toronto Blue Jays.

This is still a learning experience for me, and I know I still have a lot to learn, but I just want to put my team in the best position to win and I think I have done a decent job so far. It’s been a lot of mental focusing this year and trying to attack hitters more this season, and it’s paid off.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> What was the most fun of the recruiting process?</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>CL:</strong> First off, the recruiting process was really hectic. It is easy to get overwhelmed with it, but the most fun part was getting calls from these coaches from all these different schools. That first call or first text from a new coach that says they are showing interest in you is really enjoyable because all your hard work is paying off even before you turn 18. I sometimes wish I could go back and live it all again because it was so enjoyable, but I know I made the best decision in coming to UC Santa Barbara and I would never change that for the world.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> What got you into baseball and why did you stick with it?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> I started playing when I was about four, and being athletic growing up I played all sports like football, basketball and track but there was something about baseball that I excelled at better. I was good at other sports, but I was just that much better as baseball and I rode that all the way to college and hopefully I could keep playing for a long time.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>JM:</strong> Is there a team you would love to play for at the next level?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> Honestly, growing up in Southern California, you see how much of a diehard fanbase the Dodgers have, and I would love to be a part of their organization. I would also love to play for the Yankees, and that would be a dream come true.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> If you could pick any other sport to play and be great at, what would it be?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> I would pick basketball because I am kind of a flashy guy for the most part, and when you’re playing baseball and you’re on the field you have to reel it in a bit because baseball is more of a conservative game. If I was really good at basketball, it would be a bit easier to let my personality go and show my flashy side.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> If you could create the perfect pitcher, who would you model him after?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> He would probably look just like Clayton Kershaw because I just can’t think of anything wrong with him. I could breakdown a perfect pitcher, but honestly I would just end up breaking down Kershaw.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> Do you play Fortnite? How good are you?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> I just started getting into it, and I am much later than my friends because it didn’t look that enjoyable, but man, once you get into that first game, you just have to keep playing more and more, so I have been on it for a couple weeks now. I am so close to getting my first win and that makes it so much more agonizing because you keep getting top five, top three and then you make a simple mistake and lose. I will get there, though, and soon.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> Favorite thing about UCSB and its culture?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> I love the people. I mean the weather, the baseball team, all that is so great, but people and environment are so friendly and inviting. Everyone is so nice out here and they make it easy to fall in love with this place.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> Favorite Andrew Checketts moment?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> Checks does not really have a big personality, he is pretty straight forward and serious a lot of the time, but there is one drill we do where us as pitchers, we have to try to make plays off him, and he is trying to beat us with the ball, and that is when his personality really comes out. He has gotten some good laughs out of me.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> What legacy do you want to leave here at UCSB?</p>\n<p><strong>CL:</strong> I want people to remember me as a guy who was a model of what it looks like to be a pitcher. I want people to look back on me and tell the future generations of Gaucho pitchers that “that guy” is what it looks like to pitch here. I just want future pitchers to look back and say that’s the guy I want to be like.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 19th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
