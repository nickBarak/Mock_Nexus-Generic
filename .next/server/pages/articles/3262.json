So with that in mind, as long as the students stay Cal Grant- and Pell Grant-eligible while they’re here, then why would we not promise them four years of federal packaging?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the condition that the Promise Scholar students remain </span><a href=\"https://www.csac.ca.gov/post/how-do-i-qualify-cal-grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– and </span><a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pell Grant-eligible</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through their four years of college, they are guaranteed $120,000 in grants and scholarships when they first come to UCSB from the federal, state and institutional level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program requires students to sign contracts agreeing to maintain a 2.75 GPA upon arrival to UCSB, file their taxes on time, complete their FAFSA on time and take a handful of mandatory classes and workshops throughout their time at the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also have to agree to fill out surveys during and after their time at UCSB to help with the “continued funding and success” of the program, according to the program’s </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/promise-scholars-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the financial support, the program provides students with what Roose calls “wraparound services,” which include counseling and one-on-one support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program initially included only monetary aid when it was first started in 2015, but when Roose arrived in June 2016, it grew to include additional services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Mike Miller, who started the program, realized very quickly that you can’t just give low-income, first-generation, underrepresented students money and be like, ‘Here, go to college,’ and expect them to be able to survive,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose worked in the McNair Scholars Program at San Diego State before coming to UCSB, and said she drew from her experience there, particularly with programming, to help build the Promise Scholars Program into what it is today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose operates as a resource for students to go to with any problems and even keeps stacks of business cards for various UCSB entities on her desk so she can easily direct students to the services they need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with a small staff, Roose said it is difficult for her and her two part-time assistants to serve the needs of all 428 students in the program, especially since they have a policy of never turning a student away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose also recently started a mini-Promise Scholars Program with Joe O’Brien, assistant dean of the College of Letters &amp; Science Advising, in the form of INT 10: “Transitioning to Academic Excellence,” a course “to help students get acclimated to the university and to help build them a safety net,” Roose said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Roose runs a Scholar Retention Program, also created by Miller, to allow students who are academically disqualified and lose their financial aid to return during the summer and take classes. If they receive two B’s during their summer classes, they are able to get back into school, Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these various initiatives require more hours, and a larger staff would help Roose maintain these programs, serve the current cohort of Promise Scholars and expand the program to benefit as many students as possible, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once the students are admitted to UCSB, we just cull the most extreme low-income from that group and then we just narrow it down from there based on grades in high school and how promising of a student we think they’re gonna be,” Roose said about the selection process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just don’t have enough money to bring in every low-income student. Otherwise we would.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose believes that college should be free for everybody and hopes the Promise Scholars Program expands to the rest of the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Merced has already picked up this program, and they’ve started offering their students Promise Scholars opportunities,” she said. “And I think Berkeley is considering picking it up. So it would be nice if we could get this program everywhere.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, Roose is taking a minute to celebrate the accomplishments of this first graduating class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have students that were admitted into USC, into Harvard, into Duke, UPenn, Michigan State and UCSB Ph.D. programs and Master’s programs. And then we have some that are going to be going directly into industries,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Roose, the best part of the program is being a part of the journey her students undergo in college.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s incredible because you just go through everything with them. I’ve met some of their families, I’ve been there for them when their whole world is falling apart, I’ve been there with them when they’ve won amazing awards and it’s just ups and downs all day long,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyna Nguyen, a Promise Scholars student and linguistics major who graduated this past weekend, said that without the program, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I may not have had a college career at all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming from a single parent household, there was no way I could’ve afforded an education at UCSB without getting myself into a ridiculous amount of debt,” Nguyen said in an email.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89082\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89082\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89082\" data-attachment-id=\"89082\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/promise-scholars-program-sees-first-graduating-class/image1-14/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89082\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=278%2C371\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image1.jpeg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89082\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nguyen is part of the first graduating class from the Promise Scholars Program.<em> Courtesy of Lyna Nguyen</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the first graduating class, Nguyen has seen the program grow and take shape as Roose and Miller figured out what worked best for the students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last four years, I’ve watched the program grow into stable home for students like me. I say “home” because it truly has become a place where students can find mentors who are like older siblings, staff who care like parents, and friends who understand your at-home life better than anyone else you could find at UCSB,” Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It started out as a baby program with a handful of students and is now a campus entity with [its] own organization.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen called the Promise Scholars Program “one of the best things” that has ever happened to her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people were brought into college and left to fend for themselves. But when I was at my lowest and drowning, Promise Scholars didn’t abandon me. Quite the opposite; they never left my side. They reached out, and helped me get my life together,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This program didn’t just throw money at us and say “here, graduate.” They provided us with skills for the future, and people we can always go back to for help.

Valdenegro:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June 2017, the city of Philadelphia raised its rainbow flag high for its first annual Pride Kickoff. The pride flag fluttered in the Philadelphia air, championing the experiences of millions of TLGBQ+*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> members across the world. It harkened to the activism that got us here and to the activism to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the difference that this flag had as it marched through the streets of Philadelphia and through the many streets after that are the two stripes that adorned it on top. One black and one brown—an innocuous reminder that queerness is woven into more colors than just one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being here at UCSB has proven to me that I am those stripes. Let me explain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My college experience has pushed and pulled, expanded and contracted, championed and sequestered the many identities that constitute me. In some contexts, my brownness is celebrated. My native tongue expresses itself freely and without harassment. I can wear rainbow buttons happily and without danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in other contexts, as a lot of us have come to realize, we have to push aside who we are for an identity that is more immediate and palatable. We have to relegate our life experiences to just business or to whatever the sign on the door says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point, many of us have felt the sting from the relegation I’m talking about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re struggling to make ends meet that week, you probably don’t want to tell your professor. Why make it about you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re doing science, you’re not a woman; you’re a scientist. Why does it have to be about gender?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re an academic, you’re not a person of color; you’re an academic. Why do you have to make it about race?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re a non-traditional student, you’re just a student. Why are you different?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this kind of thinking is dangerous when we ignore the disparities and disadvantages that might exist in our settings. It is impossible to support one another if we do not understand the situations we exist in. I can’t save you from drowning if I refuse to acknowledge you’re underwater.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of that, being a person of color fighting behind the rainbow flag used to mean leaving our brownness at the door with the umbrellas. It meant fighting for a movement that never really promised to help those in the intersection of being a person of color and queer. (And don’t even get me started on how much more we need to advocate for trans people.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the wisdom that our queer brothers, sisters and non-binary siblings in Philadelphia reminded us of that June is the diverse nature of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That one descriptor does not fit all. We are not just gay. We are not just queer. Those words are just adjectives among a multiplicity of others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this Pride, go celebrate the diverse nature of being queer — heck, even the diverse nature of just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being human</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And even if you’re not queer, I invite you to turn to the person next to you and appreciate them for the depth of who they are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go fight for each other. Celebrate one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did that on purpose</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ángel A. Valdenegro is a graduating queer Latino physics major who wants you to google Kayden Clarke, Tamika Washington and Chynal Lindsey.</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>Being Invisibly Queer: by Kylie George</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who have been by my side throughout every one of my phases in college (*cough cough Nexites cough cough*), y’all know all about my various dick-scapades: From the Night of Three to fucking a random dude I met at a bus stop, my thirst for peen is never quenched.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibly the craziest thing I’ve ever done to date, however, is willingly enter into a healthy, committed relationship for the last year and some change. Shocker: This person has a penis. Therefore, my relationship will appear heterosexual to the average stranger for (hopefully) the rest of my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this staunch dedication to cock has caused some problems for me throughout my time at UCSB, if not from external sources then from my own internal thought processes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I constantly questioned — and sometimes still question — my validity as a member of the LGBTQ+ community because before sophomore year of college, I had never acted on any of my feelings toward various women in my life to whom I felt attracted. I felt like the only way for me to prove to both myself and others that my bisexuality was a valid self-descriptor was by experiencing reciprocal sex with a woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn’t even completely out until my sophomore year of college and, even still, I haven’t directly told my mom yet (if you’re reading this, Mom, hey hello hi, I’m bi!).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For my entire first year of college, I thought that people in my dorm hall would be made uncomfortable with the fact that I’m attracted to girls, so I kept my identity on the down low. It didn’t help that I was ultra-paranoid about the way people perceived me and if they liked me or not because of my </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and I say this literally </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crippling anxiety. I was also affected by the perceived lack of a queer community on campus, so I thought being out would not be accepted by the majority of UCSB students or faculty, thus further encouraging me to beat down a large part of who I was and still am.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not until I joined a sorority (Tri Delta, R.I.P.) did I feel comfortable openly sharing my deep attraction to that güd pu$$. Sure, it helped that over the summer I saw a psychiatrist and got put on a pretty high dose of Prozac to help with my anxiety, but I truly feel that I began publicly identifying as queer because of the amazing queer women I met in Tri Delta.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m fully aware of how sratty this next sentence is going to sound, but hear me out: My Big really inspired me to embrace a large facet of my identity by sharing her own story and her various struggles that come with being gay. From bringing me down from a panic attack brought on by being pretty publicly sexually assaulted to opening my eyes to the awesome (and very present) LGBTQ+ community on campus, I owe this woman a lot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My journey to self-acceptance did not conclude at the beginning of sophomore year, though. I mean, what am I? Fucking Molly Ringwald in “The Breakfast Club”???? Good guess, but not quite. I still have to exist after the happily-ever-after.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incidentally, though, I ended up sleeping with a woman for the first time shortly after this life-changing epiphany, and it left me with a bag filled with mixed feelings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took her home from a frat party (wearing a huge sweatshirt, pajama bottoms and fuzzy socks with my Birks, no less), and the deed was done. The only problem was that afterward, I didn’t feel like I proved anything to anybody by doing it. The encounter felt just as empty as the billionth dick I sucked dry the week prior, and I ended up feeling like I had an even feebler claim to membership in the queer community than I did before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since that night, I have not slept with another woman, and at this point I may never get to. Don’t get me wrong; my current partner is more than I could ever ask for in a lifelong companion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess I’m still worried about how others perceive the image I put out into the world, which is dumb and I should stop that right now, but emotions don’t work that way. I want it to be apparent that I’m queer and not just lying about it to get attention, but I’m struggling with finding a way other than tattooing “QUEER” on my forehead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend was talking to me the other day about being bisexual in college, and she expressed a lot of frustration for the girls who identify as “bi-curious” because they give “real” bisexual women a bad image.

Will they be able to rise to the occasion and make a run for the next world cup?</p>\n<p>After a disappointing loss to Belgium in the round of 16, Head Coach Jurgen Klinsmann and his team are focused for the upcoming opportunity. Although a young team lacking veteran leadership following the retirement of Landon Donovan, new faces and talent will step in place as they start their journey to Russia.</p>\n<p>Among these players lies the 23-year old striker Gyasi Zardes. The LA Galaxy forward subbed in the second half for Team USA and within 61-seconds assisted captain Clint Dempsey for the only goal scored in the game. Turns out the bright lights and big stage wasn’t too much for the young soccer player as he shined in the spotlight and continued to be in attack mode for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Dempsey was impressed by Zardes’ play, calling the forward a “dynamic” player that “will play a big part in the national team picture moving forward.”</p>\n<p>Other players on the rise include midfielder Alejandro Bedoya and goalkeeper Brad Guzan. The duo have been two critical components of Team USA’s success, specifically Bedoya’s play during the World Cup in Brazil and Guzan’s time in the Gold Cup since replacing fan favorite Tim Howard.</p>\n<p>Bedoya’s poise with the ball on the offensive end has been phenomenal. The New Jersey native put perfect placement on the ball for captain Michael Bradley to lock things up in a 1-1 stalemate against Panama on Tuesday. After learning so much in Brazil, Bedoya has stepped up to the plate and become a leader during Team USA’s summer run.</p>\n<p>Guzan has made an impact from the get go since replacing long-time goalie Tim Howard. In the five games that he’s started, the 30-year old has hosted a goal difference of +8, only conceding a total of five goals. Guzan also had seven saves in USA’s victory against Panama Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, it is the combined efforts of role players like Zardes, Bedoya, and Guzan that make the difference and will be the X-factor in giving Team USA a run in 2018. This roster isn’t centered around one major star like a Ronaldo or Messi but consists of a melting pot of role players that can impact the game with full force. If they work together as a unit this team may follow in the footsteps of the great US women’s national team.</p>\n<p>This is a new era for American soccer. After crucial years of tough losses and decisive heartbreakers, the time has come for the US to prove to others that it can be champions on the pitch. Now that the women’s team has done its part, it is up to the men to carry the torch.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64311\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64311\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-15/usmnt-on-the-rise-after-winning-group-a/","id":3260,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[3259,3258,3257],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Regents: How Representative Are They of the UC?","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-06-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Headshots_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Headshots_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"An overwhelming proportion of the student regents have come from UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first student regent to serve on the University of California Board of Regents, selected in 1975, hailed from UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carol Mock, a fourth-year political science major at the time of her appointment, was “the first student ever to become a board member in the institution’s 107 year history, and came as a result of passage of Proposition 4 in last November’s election,” a 1975 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> article read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the student regent position is a step forward in communications between students and Regents.
