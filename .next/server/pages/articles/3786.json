Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The measure will impose an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\">eight percent user utility tax</a> on electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services. It will produce a net total of approximately $740,000 per year, according to Spencer Brandt, I.V. Community Service District (CSD) board secretary.</p>\n<p>This was the CSD’s second attempt to secure consistent funding following the failure of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\">Measure F</a> in 2016, which left the CSD without a primary source of funding.</p>\n<p>The “Yes on Measure R 2018” campaign – spearheaded by Brandt, CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud, CSD President Ethan Bertrand and UC Santa Barbara Campus Democrats outgoing President Emily Murray – has been promoting the measure since the end of UCSB’s Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“Throughout this whole process, we’ve organized a group of passionate community volunteers to speak with residents about the issues that matter to them,” Bertrand said. “We knocked on every door in Isla Vista at least three times, some doors we hit up to six times.”</p>\n<p>Most I.V. residents will pay the tax, but Brandt said the CSD is currently in the process of finalizing a low-income exemption.</p>\n<p>“If there are households in Isla Vista that cannot afford to pay the tax, even though it is going to be very small, I think that it is very important that we do not put that extra burden on them,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Across the 10 precincts, 638 I.V. residents voted yes on the measure while 133 residents voted no, according to Santa Barbara County semi-official election night results: 82.75 percent vs. 17.25 percent.</p>\n<p>Approximately 23,000 people live in I.V. as of the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/islavistacdpcalifornia/PST045217#qf-flag-X\">most recently conducted</a> census in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>Initial results from the Vote By Mail and Mailed Ballot Results reported 56.34 percent yes votes and 43.66 percent no votes on the measure.</p>\n<p>However, these numbers jumped to 71.04 percent yes votes and 23.64 percent no votes once votes from the first precincts came in. The percentage of yes votes rose throughout the night from there, while the percentage of no votes steadily decreased.</p>\n<p>“We were sort of cautiously optimistic, but when that first polling station came in, and we were up, that was just insane,” Brandt said. “I don’t think any of us believed it…I was crying, I think a lot of us were.”</p>\n<p>Murray, a second-year history and public policy major, shared Brandt’s sentiments.</p>\n<p>“I walked up to Rincon, and Spencer ran out and said, ‘We did it!’” Murray said. “I was overjoyed…when we found out we won by a lot, that was amazing.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83520\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83520\" data-attachment-id=\"83520\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=2048%2C1582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure R party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83520\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=888%2C686\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is the CSD’s second attempt to secure funding. <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Throughout the course of the campaign, the pro-Measure R group <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/how-much-are-pro-anti-measure-r-groups-spending-for-your-vote/\">raised</a> $35,630.25 and spent $7,107.67 as of May 19, according to <a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByFilerName.aspx\">campaign filings</a> with the Santa Barbara County.

Community Resource Building, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“I’m just elated and so excited for the good work that we can do for the people of Isla Vista, from opening the community center to improving public safety to continuing to work on tenant-landlord issues,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The victim had a bloody nose and told officers he was “knocked out” by an approximately 6’1” white male adult, possibly named “Devin,” with blonde hair, wearing glasses and a dark shirt. An ambulance took the victim to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, units responded to a report of a fight with one subject unconscious on the 6600 block of Abrego Road. The fight had already dispersed when law enforcement arrived. Witnesses said one suspect, SBCC student Malik Williams, fled the scene and ran into a residence on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive. Williams had knocked the subject unconscious and caused two lacerations on the victim’s face. An ambulance transported the victim to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. Williams was positively identified in a line-up by witnesses who captured the fight on cell phone cameras and was booked and taken to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>Sunday, a victim reported a robbery at his residence on the 6500 block of Seville Road at approximately 4:30 a.m. He told dispatch he last saw the three subjects, two of whom were armed, heading south on foot on toward El Colegio Road. All of the subjects wore masks, dark clothes and hoodies and still remain at large. According to the victim, the suspects asked him for marijuana and money, then took his laptop and phone so he wouldn’t call 911.</p>\n<p>Monday, four IVFP units responded to a report of numerous subjects arguing over drugs and money at approximately 2:00 a.m. at the same apartment building on the 6500 block of Seville Road where Sunday’s burglary took place. Upon arrival, two units noticed one subject fleeing the area and pursued him on foot. The subject remains at large. Moments later, two remaining units detained a suspect exiting the complex with a knife and contraband. The last unit then detained a vehicle with four subjects which contained narcotics. The case is still under a sheriff’s department investigation, with all five detainees having been arrested and one remaining at large.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, Foot Patrol is “pretty certain” the suspects detained Monday are the perpetrators of Sunday’s armed robbery.</p>\n<p>“They basically just hit the place next door,” Plastino said. “The suspect description was the same. The investigation will determine whether they’re the same people from the night before but we’re 99 percent sure.”</p>\n<p>Monday evening at approximately 5:30 p.m., IVFP received report of another armed robbery on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road involving “4 to 5 black male adults armed with a firearm,” according to a UCSB Alert. The suspects remain at large and IVFP is currently investigating.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he believes Monday’s incident is not related to the armed robberies that occurred Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n<p>“I would guess they’re not from the area, but you never know,” Plastino said. “Typically you’ll get gangsters from other counties coming into I.V. to take advantage of students and residents here.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said armed robberies are “unusual” for I.V.</p>\n<p>“Typically you’ll see two to three here per year — they do happen, but not often,” Plastino said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63106\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63106\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/weekend-wrap-up-51-54/","id":3784,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[3783,3782,3781],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Respond to Auto Thefts, Assaults","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to several crimes over the weekend, including a string of burglaries and multiple incidences of assault.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to several crimes over the weekend, including a string of burglaries and multiple incidences of assault.</p>\n<p>In addition to responding to several minor crimes, law enforcement officials investigated two incidences of physical assault and made arrests in connection to burglaries occurring throughout Isla Vista. IVFP Sherriff’s Lieutenant Robert Plastino said deputies encountered an individual stealing from a vehicle in an alleyway on Picasso Road on Thursday night.</p>\n<p>The suspect was identified as Sergio Torres, a resident from Ventura, who told officers he was visiting a friend. Lieutenant Plastino reported that Torres was found to be in possession of a mask, gloves, a flashlight and wire cutters.</p>\n<p>Shortly after officers requested additional sheriff units from Goleta, a man named Dennis Rizzo — who is a friend of Torres’s — was located and apprehended on the 700 block of Camino Del Sur. According to Plastino, Rizzo was found in possession of stolen property and attempted to hide some of his burglary tools upon being spotted by police. After examining the recovered stolen items, deputies determined that the two had targeted multiple areas with smash-and-grab auto burglary that night — including locations at 6512 Segovia, El Greco and Embarcadero Del Mar, as well as locations in Montecito.</p>\n<p>Plastino said the pair was right in the midst of their theft schemes when they were spotted by law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“[They] were in the process of looking for more cars to break into when they got caught,” Plastino said. “Both were on probation out of Ventura County for theft charge and are facing several charges in SB County,”</p>\n<p>The following night, on Friday, IVFP officers responded to another auto-theft incident.</p>\n<p>“An unknown suspect took the victim’s vehicle registration, insurance card, and FM transmitter from her unsecured vehicle that was parked in front of 6522 El Greco Road,” Plastino said.Sh</p>\n<p>Although one fingerprint was found and submitted to the County Forensics Department, no description of the suspect is available.</p>\n<p>Later that evening, in the early hours of Saturday morning, at around 1 a.m., deputies responded to a victim who reported being assaulted after trying to break up a fight on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>“A student was walking westbound on 6500 block Sabado Tarde and saw four men fighting. He attempted to break up the fight and while he was doing so, an unknown person punched him from behind. He lost consciousness and broke his jaw,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>The victim was immediately transported to the emergency room for treatment and surgery, according to Plastino, but he was unable to provide a description of the suspect.</p>\n<p>Plastino commented that, although the victim had positive intentions, witnesses should always first call 911 for help.</p>\n<p>That same evening, deputies responded to another assault incident on the 6700 block of Del Playa, Plastino said.</p>\n<p>“Deputies contacted the victim, who sustained a head injury as a result of the fight,” Plastino said. “Separately, deputies arrested the suspect in the nearby area. The suspect was identified by the victim as one of the people that had kicked him in the head.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, the suspect was booked for battery with serious bodily injury.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/","id":3785,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3784,3783,3782],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
