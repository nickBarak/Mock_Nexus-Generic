As a student, your interests are at stake in this election.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats vice president of events and fourth-year geology major Sam Goldman said although the university’s position as the number one university for voter registration is commendable, the achievement can be misleading.</p>\n<p>“You want to make sure that voter registration turns into actual voting,” Goldman said. “It is obviously really awesome, and it does reflect a campus that is active and concerned with what’s going on around us. But hopefully the momentum from this event will get people excited and will carry over to election day.”<br>\nCapps said that students have a significant impact on the outcome of her race.</p>\n<p>“It’s a concentration of votes that I appreciate for my race because this race is really a tough one and so it might give me the margin of victory,” Capps said. “My husband won a congressional seat and he won by the margin of the number of students who voted in Isla Vista and at UCSB. I always try to share that with students about the importance of student votes.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, students play a large role in deciding whether or not future cyclic steam injection, acidizing or fracking will occur in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara is regarded in many places as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement and that is an important legacy,” Williams said. “We had hundreds of applications in the last year [for drilling new wells] and many would be with the most dangerous, the most water intensive and the highest carbon emissions of techniques that are out there.”</p>\n<p>According to Campus Democrats President and fourth-year chemistry major Krishna Hammond, as election day grows closer Campus Democrats will continue to promote the importance of voting to students and Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>For the “I’ve got a big clock counting down in my head ‘til election day,” Hammond said. “We’re going to be knocking on doors, calling people, going around the neighborhood, waving signs at people; basically everything you possibly can to get people to come out.”</p>\n<p>Newsom said he believes Campus Democrats’ efforts are important to help “reconcile the apathy that exists with young folks in the electoral process at all levels.”</p>\n<p>“We have an obligation to be active citizens,” Newsom said. “Young folks have the capacity to amplify their voices in a way that is unique in this generation. There are a lot of young folks that have the absolute ability to change things radically, but only if they exercise their voice and are more participatory in the life of their campus.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, October 30, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Lectures</h4>\n<p>Michael Lewis, acclaimed author of <em>Moneyball, The Blind Side</em> and <em>Flash Boys,</em> came to the Granada Theatre Tuesday night to speak about his experience as a financial journalist, storyteller and self-proclaimed sloth.</p>\n<p>Hosted by Arts &amp; Lectures, NPR business reporter Sonari Glinton moderated the evening, beginning with an interview portion and allowing time at the end for an audience question and answer session.</p>\n<p>Lewis said he graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Art History and went on to the London School of Economics to graduate with a degree in Economics.</p>\n<p>“I was very, very lucky in that before I entered University, my father told me to find and study what I loved,” Lewis said. “In exchange he would give me a three-year buffer after I left school in which he would pay for my living expenses and education.”</p>\n<p>According to Lewis, the offer from his father was instrumental for his career.</p>\n<p>“It was during this time that I discovered I wanted to be a writer, and shortly after that I discovered I had to do something to make up for my Art History degree,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>Lewis included anecdotes from his childhood in Louisiana, describing the environment of New Orleans by quoting the family motto his father once told him.</p>\n<p>“Do as little as possible, for it is better to receive a slight reprimand than perform an arduous task,” Lewis said. “A very large part of my life is dedicated to avoiding unpleasant chores.”</p>\n<p>Lewis went on to discuss the process that is involved in finding a story and putting it on paper and how the story of <em>The Blind Side</em> came to be, beginning with how he discovered it.</p>\n<p>“I went to visit a friend of mine from high school in Memphis one year,” Lewis said. “When I got to his house, there was a six-foot-tall, 350-pound black kid sitting in the living room of a white Republican Evangelical Christian in the most segregated city in America … and no one said anything about it.”</p>\n<p>Lewis continued to describe how the story progressed over the year and how he came to terms with writing a story that eventually turned into a movie about his best friend’s family, as well as his experience working as a writer in Hollywood.</p>\n<p>“It was great! Movie people are great, they fear the writer,” Lewis said. “They would solicit my opinion and then completely ignore what I said, they just wanted to make sure I would stay nice. But both ‘Moneyball’ and ‘Blindside’ turned out to be truly good films.”</p>\n<p>Lewis also said it is a highly impersonal process to have a personal work turned into a Hollywood hit.</p>\n<p>“The stupidity in Hollywood is not at the level of actors, writers and directors,” Lewis said. “There’s some truly beautiful storytelling that happens there. The stupidity in Hollywood lies in the business decisions.”</p>\n<p>Lewis concluded the discussion by answering audience questions and touching on what it means to be a good writer.</p>\n<p>“People who are really good storytellers tend to have very distinctive voices on the page, people are afraid of their individuality and once they start mimicking their favorite writers, their value is gone,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>According to Lewis, his future plans include writing a book about U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>“He has really let me into his life like no other journalist, and if I’m able to write this book the way I want, six months after the end of his presidency people will want nothing more than to read a book about Obama,” Lewis said.</p>\n<p>Glinton said she enjoyed meeting Lewis, whom he admires for his rare talent.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of those weird things when you’re meeting someone who you’ve known and followed and then you meet them and realize you don’t have to be scared about it,” Glinton said. “He’s a natural storyteller, and genuine, real, accomplished storytellers are few and far between. He’s one of the masters right now.”</p>\n<p>Glinton also said he thought Lewis’ advice would be of practical use to students.</p>\n<p>“Something he said to the student about doing what you like really stuck with me also, it’s ridiculous to tell someone to follow their dreams,” Glinton said. “But students should really be in pursuit of what they like to do.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major and Arts &amp; Lectures student manager for the event Lauren Cassis agreed and said she enjoyed his discussion about his books and his time as an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>“I thought he was very insightful and I liked how his conversation was very broad in the topics,” Cassis said. “Hearing about ‘The Blind Side,’ how the story came together, was very interesting.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An earlier version of this article used the pronoun “she” when referencing to Sonari Glinton, when in actuality the article should have used “he”.]</em></p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Since its first blood drive in Oct. 2011, the Alumni Association has drawn over 638 participants to donate blood.</p>\n<p>Alumni Association spokesperson Rocio Torres said the drive is one of many events hosted at Mosher Alumni House geared toward bridging the campus with the community.</p>\n<p>“One of our goals at the Alumni Association is provide service opportunities for alumni and students,” Torres said.</p>\n<p>Third-year geohydrology major Kaitlyn Smith said she has donated blood over 10 times since she has been to college.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great way to help people,” Smith said, “because if I needed blood, I would like it to be available.”</p>\n<p>The United Blood Services Regional Donor Recruitment Director for the Santa Barbara area Scott Edward said the amount of discomfort individuals experience when donating blood is a minor cost in comparison to its potential benefits.</p>\n<p>“The process itself is very straightforward,” Edward said. “That moment of discomfort is so small that it’s easy to put it out of your mind.”</p>\n<p>According to Edward, the blood from the drive will be given to local hospitals, as Santa Barbara is not big enough to supply blood to other areas.</p>\n<p>“We have weekly demands so consistency is key to maintaining the blood supply,” Edward said. “During the winter holiday season and summertime, donations can easy decrease, so we launch special campaigns to raise awareness and encourage donations.”</p>\n<p>Donor recruiter and blood drive scheduler Maricela Carpinteyro said maintaining a sufficient supply is not easy.</p>\n<p>“With the needs of the hospitals, we usually need about 130 pints of blood everyday to meet the hospital’s needs,” Carpinteyro said. “It’s a challenge especially since not everybody could give to everybody.”</p>\n<p>According to Edward, students should spend the time to give blood because it can have far-reaching positive effects for others.</p>\n<p>“You can save a lot of lives,” Edward said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57688\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/blood-drive-draws-donators/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57688\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/blood-drive-draws-donators/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/blood-drive-draws-donators/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/blood-drive-draws-donators/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/blood-drive-draws-donators/","id":2989,"author":{"id":179,"name":"Gabrielle Pavia"},"related":[2988,2987,2986],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
