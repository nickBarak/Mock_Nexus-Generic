It has a magical feel to it, like anything could happen,” she said.</p>\n<p>For others, such as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young, the affair is something else entirely.</p>\n<p>“I hate Halloween. Not so much the holiday or that people want to go out and have a good time. But I hate that thousands — or tens of thousands — of outsiders trash our community and houses and stress our emergency resources and then leave with us to deal with the debris,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Wondering how to handle your Halloween? Read on to make your holiday weekend the best it can be.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Ray Vuillemainroy, there will be 150 deputies and officers on patrol in Isla Vista in addition to 10 mounted police units.</p>\n<p>“The patrol will have mostly uniformed deputies, many of which are specially trained in crowd control,” he said.</p>\n<p>However, Vuillemainroy also noted that there will be “plain-clothed” cops on patrol.</p>\n<p>Vuillemainroy said students only have to act sensibly to stay out of trouble.</p>\n<p>“Be responsible. Have respect for others and, obviously, don’t indulge too much in alcohol. Basically, be responsible,” he said. “Everyone knows right from wrong.”</p>\n<p>“The main [policies] are still in place, that being the zero tolerance and the noise ordinance,” Young said.</p>\n<p>The festival ordinance, which has been in effect for 17 years, will be enforced from now until Thursday, Nov. 4. From 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. on the indicated days, no live or recorded music is permitted at a volume that can be heard from the street.</p>\n<p>Noise and festival ordinance violation fines range from $144 to $500, and any unpaid amounts will appear on your credit report.</p>\n<p>There are a slew of other laws that the IVFP will enforce. If minors are furnished with alcohol, the penalty is $1000 if the minor is aged 18 to 20, and $3000 if the minor is under 18 years of age. This fine is multiplied by the number of minors attending a party.</p>\n<p>Possession of an open container will cost you $102 to $500, and Minor in Possession penalties are $500 and a one year driver’s license suspension. If you’re caught drunk in public, you’ll pay anywhere from $525 to $1000, and public urination has a $270 standard fine upon first conviction.</p>\n<p>If you plan on having any out-of-town friends visit, check your lease first. Many landlords include a Halloween clause that bans overnight guests, alcohol or parties during the holiday weekend.</p>\n<p>Although the Social Host Ordinance is already in effect in Santa Barbara County, Vuillemainroy said the IVFP will not enforce it until December.</p>\n<p>“We were concerned about the crowding. If you were someone who lived on DP or Sabado Tarde and wanted to get to your apartment, good luck,” Michelle Morgante, UCSB alumna and former Daily Nexus news editor, said of the Halloween in the late ’80s.</p>\n<p>Not much has changed since then. However, in recent years limits have been instated to prevent some of Halloween’s past problems with street overcrowding and illegal parking.</p>\n<p>All cars on the 6500-6700 blocks of Del Playa must be off the street by 3 p.m. on Friday and can return at 6 a.m. on Monday. A number of entrance points to Del Playa, Sabado Tarde and Trigo Roads will be blocked to all incoming traffic for the weekend.</p>\n<p>Campus parking permits for Halloween, which also act as a Night &amp; Weekend Pass for the rest of Fall Quarter, are available online for $17.50 plus a $5.95 shipping cost.</p>\n<p>Every year, Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital is overwhelmed by the volume of alcohol-related accidents.</p>\n<p>“We’re overrunning the hospitals. The emergency rooms can’t handle the alcohol poisonings and other cases that come about [every year],” Young said.</p>\n<p>Alcohol poisoning signs include the inability to wake up, vomiting while passed out, slow or irregular breathing, extreme confusion and pale skin.</p>\n<p>If a friend is displaying these signs, call 9-1-1. Do not let the person fall asleep and do not induce vomiting. Turn the person on their side to prevent choking should they vomit and stay calm until authorities arrive.</p>\n<p>Even if a person does not die from alcohol poisoning, they can suffer irreversible brain damage.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Web site recommends that students “eat a good dinner and continue to snack throughout the night, alternate one alcoholic drink with one non-alcoholic drink and avoid drinking games or shots” as a way to drink safely and avoid a hangover.</p>\n<p>If you do wake up with a hangover, it is important to eat a healthy meal as soon as you can, drink plenty of water or juice and avoid excessive amounts of caffeine. Rehydrating and nourishing your body will get you back on track.</p>\n<p>Rhandy Siordia, major events coordinator for A.S., said keeping drinking under control prevents reckless behavior that could get you arrested.</p>\n<p>“People do crazy things while under the influence,” he said.</p>\n<p>For decades, Halloween has seen an elevated number of sexual harassment cases.</p>\n<p>“There would be blocks where you would get grabbed, absolutely, if you were a woman…it was completely person-to-person, elbow-to-elbow,” Morgante said.</p>\n<p>Danielle Mayorga, co-chair for Take Back the Night and fourth-year communication and linguistics major, said her group is working to prevent sexual violence on Halloween.</p>\n<p>“There’s a huge trend around Halloween where there’s a high number of sexual harassments but also sexual assault,” she said. “Things that I’ve seen on the streets on Halloween are people grabbing other’s asses or, if there’s a scantily clad person, people will grab them or make comments at them. Both are examples of sexual harassment and assault.”</p>\n<p>Any physical contact or sexual act without a clear, consensual “yes” constitutes sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“People have the right to wear whatever they want, however little they want, and it is not an invitation for people to grab them, harass them or rape them,” Mayorga said.</p>\n<p>Mayorga recommended that any rape victims call the 24-Hour Rape Crisis Hotline at (805) 564-3696 for guidance immediately following an attack. She also noted that the UCSB Women’s Center provides free and confidential counseling for both sexual assault survivors and friends of the victims.</p>\n<p>Although there are a number of police and paramedic stations located around I.V. for the weekend, Mayorga said that contacting authorities is, ultimately, the victim’s decision.</p>\n<p>“There’s a very large trend of survivors choosing not to report, due to a number of different reasons,” she said. “…They experience a loss of power, [and] being able to restore that by choosing whether you want to see a police officer or talk to a counselor is the survivor’s choice.”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Cori Lantz and A.S. coordinators are throwing a Halloween Film Festival at People’s Park in Isla Vista. The event will last throughout Saturday evening and will alternate between showing “Beetlejuice” and “The Ring” from 8:00 p.m. to 2 a.m.</p>\n<p>According to Lantz, the gathering will include free water, coffee, snacks and condoms in addition to access to restrooms.</p>\n<p>“I hope people come to watch movies, but I want them to know that there is a place for them if they need to sit down, use the bathroom or get water,” she said.</p>\n<p>Lantz said she estimates that 200 to 300 people will attend over the course of the eight hour event.</p>\n<p>Additionally, an Adopt-A-Block group will clean-up the streets from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday. Volunteers will meet at the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District office to pick up supplies. The program provides participants with lunch and a free t-shirt.\t\tThe county and university has asked students not to invite out-of-town friends to the event since 1993.</p>\n<p>Statistically, non residents are the perpetrators of most assaults and accidents.</p>\n<p>“When you have so many people come in from out of town, it changes the character of the celebration,” 3rd District Supervisor Farr said. “Statistically, the predominate number of arrests are of people who are from out of town.”</p>\n<p>IVFP and Office of Student Life statistics show that approximately 97.1 percent of the arrested and cited individuals last year were from out-of-town.</p>\n<p>According to Young, out-of-towners pose one of the biggest issues for Halloween regulation.</p>\n<p>“Hundreds, thousands, — maybe tens of thousands of strangers — are getting trashed, destroying our community, creating a big mess in the name of having a good time. And then they leave,” Young said. “That’s the problem.”</p>\n<p>Every year, the state and county spend upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars on policing, paramedics, hospital emergencies and other costs.</p>\n<p>“We have hundreds of police and dozens, if not hundreds of emergency personnel. This is all happening because of people who decide to come here and do that to us. As a citizen of this community, it frankly pisses me off that these people feel like they can come here, trash it and then leave me with the bill,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Yonie Harris, UCSB Dean of Students, said money could easily be conserved if the Halloween celebrations are limited to locals only.</p>\n<p>“What really upsets me and has always upset me is the waste of tax dollars — in a time like now when the state, county, and university are in a financial crisis, it is quite unfortunate that we have to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on public safety, clean up, transportation, medical support, etc. for a big party that centers around drinking,” she said in an e-mail.  “I can think of so many other things that those resources could be used for.”</p>\n<p>MacIan said that, ultimately, it is the students’ responsibility to keep Halloween safe and fun.</p>\n<p>“For people in I.V., if you want [Halloween] to be good, then make it good. There’s nobody else there to make it good for you,” she said. “You can’t expect it to be Disneyland, because it’s not fucking Disneyland.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/biggest-college-party-california/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/biggest-college-party-california/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/biggest-college-party-california/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/biggest-college-party-california/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/biggest-college-party-california/","id":3577,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3576,3575,3574],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell","biography":"Not available","articles":[1284,3495,3499,3521,3528,3569,3575,3577,3578,3580,3809,3810,3834,3836,3837,3838,3840],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"CSUs Will Not Raise Tuition in 2018","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2018-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/campus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/campus.jpg?resize=740%2C325&ssl=1","description":"California State Universities will not be raising tuition for the 2018-2019 academic year, according to a press release from the university system’s website.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California State Universities will not be raising tuition for the 2018-2019 academic year, according to a press release from the university system’s website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Timothy P.

According to a 1954 article by El Gaucho’s Christy Lord, students from around the state flocked to the event, which included football games between UC teams and a massive bonfire at the Cal Greek Amphitheatre. </p>\n<p>However, despite its popularity among students, references to “All Cal” in El Gaucho ended by the mid-‘60s. </p>\n<p>UCSB’s own predecessor to Halloween was a Homecoming celebration in the fall, which, according to MacIan, included the crowning of a Homecoming Queen and a bonfire rally. The event waned after moving the parade location from State Street in downtown Santa Barbara to Isla Vista in 1968, and the event ended entirely when the football team was disbanded in 1971 due to budget cuts.</p>\n<p><strong>The First of Halloween</strong></p>\n<p>The initial signs of mayhem were reported in 1962 when, according to a 1965 El Gaucho article, “there was a … disturbance between two dormitory living groups involving water balloons and mud-clot throwing.” </p>\n<p>Riotous conduct was reported in 1963 as well. </p>\n<p>“Students entered a women’s residence hall, knocked down the housemother and poured through the building,’” Captain Willis A. Lowe said in the article. “Students also gathered in groups of hundreds on street corners.” </p>\n<p>In Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History, Carmen Lodise said the first of the more modern Halloween parties also began to spring up around that time.</p>\n<p>“Starting sometime in the 1960s, locals began dressing up and attending keg parties along Del Playa Drive,” he said.</p>\n<p>However, according to MacIan, Halloween reports are strangely absent from the Nexus and other Santa Barbara community papers from 1966 until the late ‘70s — a testament that the celebration was not a news-worthy event until 1978.</p>\n<p>“Nineteen-seventy has been the most startlingly controversial year in UCSB history,” said the La Cumbre yearbook that year. With the dawn of the 1970s came escalating political tension at the university.</p>\n<p><strong>“Del Playa Becomes a Halloween Riot.”</strong></p>\n<p>The infamous burning of the Isla Vista Bank of America building in February 1970 added to the general sense of unrest felt across the nation.</p>\n<p>In a 1988 interview printed in the Isla Vista Free Press, then-sociology professor Dick Flacks discussed the political climate.</p>\n<p>“What happened [in I.V.] was that there was some kind of mass release from that need to suppress the rebellion,” he said. “When thousands of people are marching in defiance of authority, suddenly you become ‘authorized’ to reel against that authority, to express those buried feelings. And, there was an emotional, psychological release in expressing them, especially with a whole lot of other people expressing them, too.”</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Foot Patrol was created in the fall of 1970 in response to the revolutionary behavior in the area.</p>\n<p>“The Foot Patrol was designed as a solution to the specific problems Isla Vista was experiencing in the wake of the 1970 civil disturbances — problems, some said, that were directly associated with the lack of community relations between police and students,” Andrew Shulman wrote in a 1988 issue of the Isla Vista Free Press.</p>\n<p>Tension mounted until 1978, when students recognized Halloween as an opportunity to strike out against authority. </p>\n<p>On October 30, the Daily Nexus’ front page headline read “Del Playa Party Becomes a Halloween Riot.” According to the article, a party of approximately 600 revelers turned violent when two officers on bicycles were pelted with bottles from a balcony and subsequently entered the residence. Of the 18 arrested, seven were UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Amidst the confusion, there were scattered reports of police brutality. A Nexus reporter noted that she allegedly saw an officer grab a female passenger out of a vehicle by her hair before slamming her against a cop car.</p>\n<p>The next year, locals seized another chance for rebellion. </p>\n<p>The Nexus’ headline on October 31, 1979 read, “Calm Halloween Reported to IVCC,” but, in reality, a riot of an entirely different nature broke out. Unlike the 1978 riot, which began spontaneously, posters announcing a staged riot were distributed throughout SBCC and local high schools. According to MacIan, the perpetrators of the riot that transpired consisted of mostly high school students, copy-cats of the year before. </p>\n<p>Due to the obvious placement of the posters, police were able to plan for the events and the riot was quickly shut down.</p>\n<p><strong>“The Golden Years:” 1980-1985</strong></p>\n<p>“It wasn’t until the ‘80s that Isla Vista became a destination for Halloween. The reason for it is still a mystery,” MacIan said. “Nobody can tell for sure why going to Isla Vista for Halloween became so popular, except for those [1978 and ‘79] riots … Rumor of the riots spread and people wanted to see what was going on there.”</p>\n<p>In November of 1980, the Nexus’ Jonathan Alburger wrote, “Unlike the ‘mini riots’ which marked the last two years of celebration in the Del Playa area, Friday’s procession of costumed students handled themselves without any major incident…”</p>\n<p>From 1980 onward, the number of attendees began steadily increasing by approximately 1,000 attendees every year until 1985 — when the number spiked to 10,000.</p>\n<p>Michelle Morgante, who attended UCSB from 1985 to 1991 and worked as a Nexus news editor, said her Halloween weekends were always positive, despite the growing crowds.</p>\n<p>“It was a blast and I lived on D.P. for three years, so I had a great location for the whole scene,” she said. “We had live bands playing everywhere and keg parties were very common. Everyone just kind of wandered the streets with their plastic cup listening to great music.”</p>\n<p><strong>“All Hell Broke Loose in 1986…”</strong></p>\n<p>The 1986 Halloween weekend marked the first time that the open container ordinance was enforced, which prohibited anyone from carrying open alcohol in public.</p>\n<p>“You had to carry your cup upside down when you were walking in the street … People learned how to deal with it,” Morgante said. </p>\n<p>Despite the new restriction, that year saw a record-breaking number of attendees. “All hell broke loose in 1986 when over 30,000 people showed up, literally thousands arriving in a fleet of chartered busses from San Diego State University,” Lodise wrote. “The cops busted over 1,000 persons that weekend, nearly three-fourths from SDSU.”</p>\n<p>With the rise in Halloween attendees, came a rise in criminal activity. </p>\n<p>“A female UCSB student who thought she had been hit by flying rocks went three days with a bullet in her chest before discovering that she had been shot,” according to an Office of Student Life administrative file. </p>\n<p>That same year, a 26 year-old male sustained multiple stab wounds to the chest and two others fell off the bluffs. </p>\n<p>Due to the unprecedented attendance in 1986, the university recognized a need to reduce the number of out-of-towners. In 1987, UC officials launched the first “Don’t Come to I.V.” campaign at other California campuses.</p>\n<p>The county also leapt into action by commissioning traffic control to restrict the volume of out-of-towners. Cars rushed to the area on Friday but, by 8 p.m., the area was closed to incoming traffic and students were directed to park on campus or Hollister Road. </p>\n<p>Regardless, Nexus and A.S. records show that 35,000 still managed to find their way onto the streets. A total of 1,096 arrests were made — the largest ever for any Halloween weekend in Isla Vista. </p>\n<p>The Office of the Vice Chancellor announced in late October of 1989 that the CHP and Sheriff ’s Department would establish points on a number of main access points to restrict access to Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>These new regulations marked the beginning of a chain of restrictions aimed to curb Halloween, culminating in the 1993 “Five Year Plan,” which has lasted for almost two decades.</p>\n<p><strong>CHECK OUT TOMORROW’S NEXUS FOR PART TWO OF THE SERIES: 1990-2009</strong></p><div

Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said the increase was vital, as the UC would have a $30 million hole in its funding without the hike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we are recommending… is a modest increase in non-resident student tuition, 2.6 percent. It’s basically a cost-of-living adjustment,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our primary purpose is to educate the next generation of Californians.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association (UCSA) has been the loudest voice against the tuition hike. UCSA President Caroline Siegel-Singh delivered a letter to state legislators on March 6, opposing both a non-resident student cap and the tuition hike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we discuss the importance of an affordable UC education, we cannot neglect that non-residents contribute a total of $120 million towards need-based financial aid through the UC grant and therefore support approximately 100,000 California residents,” the letter read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Sherry Lansing first proposed not voting on the issue, saying that she “came in with one point of view” and now felt conflicted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think there is so much more work to do on this. I think that we should hold off on this if possible and really talk to the legislature and really look at possible scholarships and how we handle this situation,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hadi Makarechian, chair of the Finance and Capital Strategies Committee, presented a recommendation from the committee to move forward with the $762 tuition increase, but said that there was opposition to the increase within the committee, including from himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several Regents voiced their concerns about the tuition hike, saying it would make the UC less of a “world-class institution” and accessible only to the very wealthy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Michael Cohen also pointed out that the increase would affect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) students who might be California residents but do not qualify for in-state tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When [students] get on campus, for me they’re all California students, and we have sort of a moral obligation to treat them the same way we would all of our other students,” he said about out-of-state students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent John A. Pérez said that until the Regents “reopen the discussion about pathways for financial aid for out-of-state students,” he could not support the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez also recommended “admission group cohort increases,” which would mean that when accepted, students would pay the listed rate at the time for the four years they attend a UC. Any tuition increases voted on when they are in school would not affect students currently enrolled, keeping tuition the same for a class of students when they first enter school up until they graduate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Regents plans to reconsider the tuition hike at their next meeting in May, which will be held at UC San Francisco. In the meantime, they will explore other avenues to resolve the $30 million budget hole, they decided at today’s meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One option they are looking to is asking the state legislature for money to sustain the programs that would be cut without the hike, as Napolitano noted that the state would not provide funds for out-of-state students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also intend to look for a way to differentiate DACA students from out-of-state and international students and develop a way to provide financial assistance for out-of-state students. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
