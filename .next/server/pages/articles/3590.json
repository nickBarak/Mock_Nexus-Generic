Commons</em></p></div>\n<p>“[The changes will] unravel critical protections for individuals who experience sexual harassment, and undermine the very procedures designed to ensure fairness and justice,” Taylor said in the press release.</p>\n<p>Title IX is the federal civil rights law which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities that receive federal funding.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education released an extensive report of <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-nprm.pdf\">proposed Title IX amendments</a> on Nov. 16.</p>\n<p>These amendments would narrow the definition of sexual harassment under Title IX policy, limit investigations to “formal” complaints and require live hearings for cases of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education has authorized a 60 day period of public comment regarding the proposal.</p>\n<p>U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who spearheaded the guidelines change, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-proposed-title-ix-rule-provides-clarity-schools-support-survivors-and-due-process-rights-all\">said the amendments were made</a> with both the survivor and accused student in mind.</p>\n<p>“My focus was, is, and always will be on ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment,” DeVos said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“That starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on.”</p>\n<p>The Title IX amendments would rework the definition of sexual assault, changing it from “incidents that limit a student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the educational programs” to “conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school’s education program or activity,” according to the proposal.</p>\n<p>This redefinition would limit what is legally considered sexual harassment, thus invalidating the experiences of many victims, Taylor said.</p>\n<p>“Narrowing the scope of what constitutes sexual harassment risks leaving serious misconduct unaddressed,” she said in the press release.</p>\n<p>The Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which enforces civil rights laws in programs that receive federal assistance, has used an appropriate definition of sexual harassment in the past, according to Taylor.</p>\n<p>Changes to this definition would not only create “new and unnecessary hurdles” for survivors but also create obstacles for OCR’s enforcement of Title IX.</p>\n<p>“The proposed rules significantly weaken the OCR’s authority to enforce Title IX. In stark contrast to its current enforcement powers, OCR would not require changes to a school’s process unless it determines the school is ‘deliberately indifferent,’ an incredibly high standard,” Taylor said in her statement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the proposed regulations would require live hearings for sexual assault allegations. These live hearings would allow for the cross-examination of plaintiffs through the parties’ advisors, according to the amendments report.</p>\n<p>Taylor expressed doubt that alterations to Title IX policy would improve the legal proceedings following incidents of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The rules are prescriptive… the proposed hearings would allow representatives of alleged assailants to directly cross-examine complainants, which is wholly unnecessary and inherently intimidating, especially to students making the already difficult decision to come forward,” Taylor said.</p>\n<p>Taylor is adamant about the UC’s stance against the proposed regulations, calling the amendments “ill-advised attempts to erode important Title IX protections for all members of the community.”</p>\n<p>“UC remains steadfast in its commitment to combating sexual violence through prevention, transparent and fair resolution processes, and just outcomes,” she said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“The university will continue to ensure its policies and procedures protect the rights and well-being of all parties in the process.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

in Corwin Pavilion on May 10.</p>\n<p>The resolution, sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine members Anumita Kaur and Edan Tessema, called for the university to divest from companies such as Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett-Packard, which allegedly perpetuate human rights abuses of the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p>A resolution to divest was first proposed at UCSB in 2013 and has now failed to pass four times.</p>\n<p>Eight other UC campus student governments have voted to divest, including Berkeley, San Diego, Riverside, Irvine, Merced, Los Angeles, Davis and Santa Cruz. No UC campus, however, has actually divested.</p>\n<p>The first divestment resolution was proposed at UC Berkeley in 2010, where it passed through the student government but was later vetoed by then-student president Will Smelko. The latest resolution passed in 2015.</p>\n<p>Some divestment resolutions, however, have faced further challenges. A UC Santa Cruz divestment resolution passed through its student government in May 2014 but was almost recalled in 2015 due to concerns about the original voting process.  At UC Davis, a resolution to divest passed in January 2015 but was recalled in February 2015 by the student court.</p>\n<p>The UC Board of Regents released its “Principles of Intolerance” last year, a statement condemning anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism on UC campuses. In 2010, the Regents’ chairman, vice chairman and UC president released a statement saying they will not divest until the U.S. government declares that the foreign nation is “committing acts of genocide.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was allegedly the last of the UCs to vote in 1978 to divest from companies with business ties in South Africa during apartheid. The UC Regents voted to divest from the corporations in 1986.</p>\n<p>Kaur, a fourth-year sociology major, said she sees similarities in the South African divestment history and the current debate with Israel and Palestine.</p>\n<p>“For the fourth time in a row … UCSB is on the wrong side of history,” Kaur said. “I think that consistently UCSB’s Associated Students is choosing to remain complacent and complicit in violence.”</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman of the Santa Barbara Hillel said the Israel-Palestine conflict is a “complex situation” and said he commends the Senate for “not following the path” of other student senates to vote to divest.</p>\n<p>Goodman said, however, that the eight other UC student governments that voted to divest are not representative of the current student bodies of those campuses because students, interests and motivations have changed since they voted to divest.</p>\n<p>“It’s a misnomer to say that all are voting to divest,” Goodman said. “They have each voted at a moment in time to do this.”</p>\n<p>According to Hillel International, UCSB has a current Jewish population of 2,850 students or 14 percent. This number is higher than on any other UC campus.</p>\n<p>Goodman said the large Jewish community at UCSB is a bonded group, and he cited the “UCSB Jewish Student Organizations’ Unified Opposition to BDS” unity letter as a sign of the collective efforts and ideals of the Jewish student population.</p>\n<p>Eight Jewish student organizations signed and released the letter last week in response to the divestment resolution and the Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.</p>\n<p>“Judaism is much more than a religion; it is a people,” Goodman said. “Israel plays an important role in the sense of Jewish peoplehood.”</p>\n<p>Kaur said she believes the resolution did not pass because there is a “lack of diversity” on Senate that she claims is due to the one-party dominance in A.S. elections. She said this results in similar ideologies running across the whole Senate.</p>\n<p>“We consistently see just one party sweeping our election,” Kaur said. “You can’t have a real democracy when it’s always one party that has the monopoly.”</p>\n<p>Despite supporting opposite positions of the divestment debate, Kaur and Goodman both said they believe students need to fully educate themselves about the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>\n<p>“There is a genuine [and] deep lack of understanding of what this divestment resolution is really about,” she said.</p>\n<p>Goodman said he does not believe UCSB will ever vote to divest but said he dislikes the way two different sides have emerged surrounding the debate.</p>\n<p>“I hate the idea that there is a winner and a loser here,” Goodman said, adding that he believes UCSB’s student body is willing to engage in contentious dialogue instead of only “trying to pick a fight” with one another.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang did not comment on the university’s position on divestment but said it is the university’s “role and responsibility” to create a space where students can discuss controversial topics.</p>\n<p>“I so appreciate seeing our students engage in such a thoughtful and passionate discussion on this issue as well as others,” Yang said in a statement. “Listening to and learning from each other are among the great benefits of being part of a diverse campus community represented by a variety of perspectives.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77952\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77952\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/","id":3587,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3586,3585,3584],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Regents Release Multi-Year Framework and Budget for 2019-20 School Year","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2018-11-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/UC-Regents_Nexus-File-Photo-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/UC-Regents_Nexus-File-Photo-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Regents set aside $86.3 million of the budget to grow California resident undergraduate student enrollment by 2,500 students.

voted on and selected at the UC Student Organizing Summit. Each campaign lasts two years. As a result, each year typically sees one returning campaign and one newly elected one.</p>\n<p>This year, however, UCSA will support three campaigns due to a tie in votes between UCSOS and reIGNITE, UC Santa Barbara representative on the UCSA Board of Directors Kristin Hsu said. These campaigns were selected by the UCSA Board of Directors, which is composed of student representatives from the different UC campuses.</p>\n<p>“By selecting them as UCSA campaigns, UC students are committed to increasing awareness and seeking solutions that can address these issues,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>We Are 3D, the newly-elected campaign, will advocate for an increase in resource allocation for disabled, chronically ill and neurodivergent UC students. The campaign is currently advocating for a free 24-hour transportation service, increased accessibility to classrooms and health insurance for pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p>The UCSOS campaign will address the widespread food and housing insecurity prevalent amongst UC students. The campaign organizers are currently attempting to coordinate a UC hunger and homelessness week and hope to establish a standard of living for students at a UCSA meeting with UC President Janet Napolitano in two weeks.</p>\n<p>reIGNITE focuses on the same issues addressed by the 2013-2015 I.G.N.I.T.E. campaign, which discussed the school-to-prison pipeline, issues of diversity on UC campuses and UC campus climate.</p>\n<p>According to Nushi Yapabandara, a fourth-year philosophy major and reIGNITE cofounder and campaign coordinator at UCSB, a total of $6,000 from UC student fees is allocated for the campaigns, though the funds are not necessarily distributed evenly among the three campaigns.</p>\n<p>This is the UCSOS campaign’s last year, while UCSA is solidifying reIGNITE as a permanent campaign renamed as permIGNITE.</p>\n<p>“Many of the system-wide issues that students organize around cannot be fixed in one to two years but it is extremely important that we do what we can with the time we have,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said she worked to bring a resolution to UCSA asking to make permIGNITE a permanent campaign to carry out the campaign’s long-term goals.</p>\n<p>Daniel Nagey, UC Davis’s undergraduate representative for the UCSA Board of Directors, explained that the reIGNITE campaign plans to work towards affirmative action, establishing a UC-wide UC Police Department oversight committee and a student bill of rights at a university-wide level.</p>\n<p>The board also plans to engage in local, low-income community outreach, recruitment retention spaces and prison divestment awareness.</p>\n<p>Nagey said the two UCSA campaigns had “pretty low” success rates last year, which he attributes to the November elections. He said he believes last year’s political climate made UC student governments and the UCSA board feel hopeless, but said he was optimistic for this year’s campaigns.</p>\n<p>“This situation obviously still is bad, but the shock is not there,” Nagey said.  “I’m hoping that we can push through and get these demands met within the year.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Nushi Yapabandara is a fourth-year philosophy major, not a third-year, as previously reported. </em></p>\n<p><em>The article was also corrected to show that the reIGNITE campaign is already a permanent campaign. Yapabandara worked to bring a resolution to UCSA to make permIGNITE a permanent campaign. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79097\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79097\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/","id":3589,"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon"},"related":[3588,3587,3586],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
