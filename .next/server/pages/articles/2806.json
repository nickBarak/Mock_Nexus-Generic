Senators look on as they hear funding requests from campus organizations. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met in the State Street Room of the University Center on Friday to address funding requests regarding reallocation and cultural events.</p>\n<p>Prior to the meeting, the Office of Student Life (OSL) budget responsible for funding campus clubs stood at $0, the Senate Unallocated Budget used mainly for A.S. financial matters stood at $2,872 and the Graduation and Culture week budget stood at $8,831. Of the three clubs requesting funding, the Black Student Union (BSU) received the full request for $4,300 from the Culture and Graduation budget. The Queer People of Color Collective and Active Minds did not receive funding. The committee also granted a request to reallocate funding for an upcoming Sigma Pi Epsilon fraternity fundraiser.</p>\n<p>Black Culture Week co-chair and second-year black studies major Mikayla Williams said BSU’s Black Culture Week event will kick-off with a barbeque May 18 and include several cultural activities, including a film screening, spoken word night and candlelight vigil to remember Malcolm X and Yuri Kochiyama, a Japanese-American human rights activist and a member of Malcolm X’s Organization of Afro-American Unity.</p>\n<p>“Tuesday [May 19] is actually the birthday of Malcolm X so we will be holding an event commemorating his birthday as well Yuri Kochiyama’s, with a candlelight vigil to honor them,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>A.S President Ali Guthy also presented the President’s Agenda and said the Academic Affairs Board budget has been cut due to its recent merge with the Office of the Internal Vice President.</p>\n<p>In assessing the allocation of funds for Queer People of Color Conference and Active Minds, A.S. Finance and Business Committee advisor Cindy Lopez reminded senators the OSL budget is at $0 and that senate unallocated fees should be kept primarily for A.S. expenses.</p><div

Santa Barbara area, held a forum to discuss university handling of sexual assault last Thursday night at Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall.</p>\n<p>The forum, hosted by Walter H. Capps Center’s Forum on Ethics and Public Policy, discussed whether or not university administrations do enough to prevent sexual assault. Recently, Jackson and Williams have both introduced legislation geared toward ending sexual violence on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Event coordinator Gregory Jarrett said the Capps Center does not endorse specific politicians or legislation but denounces sexual assault as an ethical issue.</p>\n<p>“We are decidedly not neutral on ethics and we do not feign indifference to the fact that this is a profoundly neglected problem not just for the survivors of sexual assault, but for all women and their Title IX right to an equal education and equal protection under the law,” Jarrett said.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson it is currently unsafe for women to walk alone around college campuses, the very environments which are supposed to foster the education of the “future leaders of our state.”</p>\n<p>“According to the Department of Justice, 1 in 5 college women experience rape or attempted rape during their time as a student, and we know that less than five percent of all rapes and attempted rapes are reported,” Jackson said. “I believe we have a duty to continue to transform the culture on our campuses and make them safer environments for our students.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62754\" style=\"width: 332px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62754\" data-attachment-id=\"62754\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/representatives-discuss-sexual-assault-policy-culture/hbj-and-dw_christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429821915\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"HBJ and DW_Christina DeMarzo-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62754\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2-250x166.jpg?resize=322%2C214\" alt=\"Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus\" width=\"322\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Jackson, who joint-authored Senate Bill 967 — popularly known as the “Yes Means Yes” law — last year, said the now-passed legislation can affect change if the language in the bill is appropriately enforced.</p>\n<p>“Only ‘yes’ means ‘yes,’ and it requires college campuses to educate students about consent and sexual assault,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said various types of media, such as YouTube videos, trivialize sexual assault and rape and schools need to counter this message with education.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, university disciplinary codes should be strong enough to adequately penalize perpetrators of sexual assault, because survivors often do not want to involve law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“This is criminal conduct and if we cannot find you guilty of a crime; if we cannot for reasons — and we know there are many — get young women to step up and pursue cases in the criminal arena, we can certainly throw you out of school for this behavior,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Jackson also said existing procedures for handling sexual assault do not appropriately serve survivors.</p>\n<p>“The processes today, many of them favor the perpetrators,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, most perpetrators of sexual assault on college campuses are repeat offenders.</p>\n<p>”They continue to victimize women on campus,” Jackson said. “And it is critically important that we get them off campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the number of sexual assaults reported is high, but the number of people held accountable is still relatively low.</p>\n<p>“Most survivors do not even know if anyone is facing justice,” Williams said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62755\" style=\"width: 314px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62755\" data-attachment-id=\"62755\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/representatives-discuss-sexual-assault-policy-culture/hbj-and-dw_christina-demarzo-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429821977\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"95\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"HBJ and DW_Christina DeMarzo-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62755 \" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-3-250x166.jpg?resize=304%2C202\" alt=\"\" width=\"304\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christian DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Williams said the universities should accurately report sexual assault and rape statistics, which “should be public” and are too often skewed in favor of conveying a good image to prospective students and parents.

college, so what accountability is there?” Williams said.</p>\n<p>According to Williams college campuses should not tolerate a culture that leads to sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“Rape doesn’t begin with

Vigna’s talk on malware, short for malicious software, will discuss research being developed to fight cybercriminals who quickly adapt to countermeasures being deployed in cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>According to Vigna, the lecture will focus on four key questions: “What is malware?,” “How does it operate?,” “How does it affect us?” and “How can the average person protect themselves?”</p>\n<p>“Everyone is susceptible to malware,” Vigna said. “If you’re on the Internet you will be attacked one way or another and it’s important to know how it works.”</p>\n<p>Vigna said the damage caused by malware varies in strength but can create major repercussions, especially for students.</p>\n<p>“Malware can steal personal information, like your bank info, and sell it in the underground market for money,” Vigna said. “They could encrypt your files and ask for a ransom. If you do not have a backup you will not be able to get your files back, which can be especially troublesome for students who may have a project or a big paper due the next day.”</p>\n<p>According to Vigna, writing malware is as difficult as coding any other computer program, varying in strength and complexity depending on the developer’s experience.</p>\n<p>“It takes skill when you want do something very sophisticated that hides its presence very well,” Vigna said. “There is very simple malware … and there is other sophisticated malware that goes deep into the operating system.”</p>\n<p>Vigna said that protecting against malware is a competition between defense and attacker because the superior program comes out on top.</p>\n<p>“You’re against another person trying to make your stuff work against his; it is a battle against one another,” Vigna said. “It’s an arms race.”</p>\n<p>Vigna also said malware changes at a rapid rate because it, and the products developed to detect it, is continuously evolving.</p>\n<p>“We come out with new techniques to detect malware and they’ll come out with new techniques from our techniques, and we have to come out with new way to find theirs,” Vigna said. “It’s continued evolution.”</p>\n<p>First-year film and media studies major Andrew Okeh said students should take cybersecurity classes in high school because they depend on computers now more than generations before them.</p>\n<p>“With this increase in computer use it would be wise to implement basic ‘safe online behavior classes,’ like how we learn about having safe sex,” Okeh said. “I mean it is 2015! Practices like installing anti-malware software, updating computers, not using random networks or downloading stuff from sketchy websites.”</p>\n<p>Second-year computer science major Dylan Lynch said he is interested in attending Vigna’s talk because cyber security is relevant to anyone who uses the Internet.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited to attend the talk because I think computer security is growing to be a really lucrative field,” Lynch said. “It’s very relevant because of all the companies people trust with their personal information.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/","id":2804,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2803,2802,2801],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Meeting Discusses Term Lengths","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stakeholder_Alexander-Payne-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stakeholder_Alexander-Payne-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, county representatives and UC Santa Barbara Associated Students met Tuesday night in the I.V.

Clinic Building for the weekly self-governance meeting held by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office to discuss plans to develop I.V. into a Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Stakeholders discussed whether CSD governing board members would serve two-year or four-year terms. According to the language in Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 to establish I.V. as a CSD, all board members would serve four-year terms. With an informal hand vote Tuesday, attendees voted to have one two-year and four four-year board member positions.</p>\n<p>Discussions at previous meetings suggested one of the five elected board members should be appointed by UCSB and another by Santa Barbara County. Stakeholders also continued the discussion from previous weeks on how to set official boundaries for I.V. as a CSD and several attendees expressed preference for including UCSB buildings, such as university-owned apartments and residence halls, within the boundaries of the proposal.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator and second-year history of public policy Paola Dela Cruz said setting a two-year term candidacy for board members would allow more students to run for a position on the board.</p>\n<p>“Just looking at the students who have run for Park District, I think most of them are not first years,” Dela Cruz said.  “Generally it’s second years or third years so that by the time they graduate they have either two or three years on the board. Personally, I think having a two-year position makes it easier.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez said he agrees a two-year term would be suitable, and board members who wish to serve longer could run for consecutive terms.</p>\n<p>“I would probably not run for something that was four years if I was only planning on staying in for two years,” Lopez said. “Couldn’t you just run again for re-election if you wanted to stay another two years?”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk, the two-year position was suggested to address the concern that student board members lack dedication and knowledge.</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve been pretty clear that the goal of that position is to avoid student transiency,” Schunk said. “Let’s address the elephant in the room: we’re worried students won’t be educated enough and informed enough to make decisions on the board.”</p>\n<p>While Schunk said one potential way to develop board members’ experience would be to establish a year-long trial period, during which time their votes will not count towards decisions being made by the board, the proposal was voted down by attendees.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how this works as far as constitutionality or whether it’s legal,” Schunk said. “We could say you have a year where you can’t vote but you are still expected to show up because you are a member of the board.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, including UCSB in the official boundaries of the proposed CSD would pressure the university to make a decision regarding their involvement in I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>“To me, including them in the boundaries makes it really clear,” Schunk said. “They can either say they don’t want to be in these boundaries and we can ask them why they don’t want to, or they can say they do and we can come back as a group and ask if we want to let them in.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said she does not feel comfortable allowing short-term residents living in UCSB-owned properties to have representation in I.V. governance.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want people who have not lived in Isla Vista to be making decisions about things that happen out here that they don’t have first-hand knowledge of yet,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p>Because of time constraints, stakeholders made no decision concerning CSD boundaries and chose to continue the discussion at a later meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62890\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62890\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/","id":2805,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2804,2803,2802],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
