The danzantes included PODER members, a Chumash man, UCSB students and several locals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LGBTQ, Mexican and American flags were flown throughout the crowd, intended to celebrate the diversity of America on this Veterans Day weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the final gathering in Pershing Park, a small group of Trump supporters showed up, upsetting some of the protesters.

The district as a whole registered around 9,600 more people this year than in the 2012 election.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista voter registration drives set a new record during the last week of October, registering over 13,000 new voters for the November election. Approximately 11,000 students were registered in 2012 and 10,800 were registered in 2010.</p>\n<p>UCSB leads other universities such as UCLA, which reported approximately 10,100 registered voters, USC, which registered a mere 411 students according to The Daily Bruin and UC San Diego, which reported around 3,000 registered voters according to the UCSD voter registration coalition.</p>\n<p>“They have done a better job of turnout in Isla Vista than I have ever seen, over 13,000 voters voted in Isla Vista today, and it’s because of the very, very hard work of these democrat activists,” Das Williams, supervisor elect, said.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara County, 60 percent of the presidential votes went to Secretary Clinton, 32 percent to Trump, 3.5 percent to Gary Johnson and 2 percent were write-ins. California is undeniably a liberal state, so higher voter turnout likely wouldn’t have changed any results here, but in other states voter turnout could have made all the difference in this pinnacle election.</p>\n<p>Millennials proved to be a major force in this year’s election. A photo from SurveyMonkey showing the country’s Electoral College votes if only millennials had voted went viral on Tuesday, with the large majority of them, 473 to be exact, going to Secretary Clinton.</p>\n<p>Millennials supported Clinton with 54 percent of the youth vote, but many millennials are angry with rumors of thousands of young people writing in “Harambe” on their ballots or even for voting for third-party candidates. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported, “For the Democratic Party to move forward and win, young people — some of the party’s most vocal critics — cannot be shut out of what will be a rebuilding process.”</p>\n<p>The 3rd District County Board of Supervisors had a large turnout of 25,136 votes with Joan Hartmann leading Bruce Porter by 8 percent. The Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District had a total of 7,317 votes to reelect Pegeen Soutar as director of the District.</p>\n<p>Measures E and F had an underwhelming amount of voter turnout with approximately 4,150 votes on each measure. Measure E passed with a significant majority of 88 percent, but Measure F, which only 62 percent of people voted yes on, did not pass. If voter turnout had been even higher, perhaps Measure F would have gone through or results for various different offices could have been different.</p>\n<p>Though turnout was strong, an anonymous Campus Democrats volunteer said that word of mouth was that at 6 p.m. on Tuesday only half of registered voters in I.V. had actually voted.</p>\n<p>In 2008, national voter turnout was relatively high at 62.3 percent but dropped in 2012 to an estimated 57.5 percent. This year’s turnout, expected to level around 55.6 percent according to the U.S. Elections Project, shows a trend toward Americans across the country not casting their vote. Reasons for not voting range from being blocked or restricted, being too busy with work and/or childcare, to simply deciding not to vote on principle, according to The New York Times.</p>\n<p><em>A

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The residence on Greenhill Way where a family was found dead on Wednesday <em>(Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office).</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Weidong Henry Han, 57; his wife, Huijie Yu, 29, who was known as Jennie; and their daughter, Emily Han, 5, were found dead in their house on the 4600 block of Greenhill Way on Wednesday evening by sheriff’s deputies who were responding to a call to check their welfare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sheriff’s Office says it appears the family was targeted and that the “horrific” murder was not a random attack. The residence on Greenhill Way is less than five miles from UC Santa Barbara’s campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sheriff’s detectives are actively investigating this case and are working around the clock to determine who is responsible,” the Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Han owned the Santa Barbara Herb Clinic on State Street in Santa Barbara, which he founded in 1991, according to the clinic’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website says Han graduated from the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine in 1982 and has been practicing medicine since 1989. Han co-authored multiple books and had a contract with publisher Random House for a book on the integration of Chinese and Western medicine, according to the website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His wife, Yu, hailed from Weihai, China, a coastal city in the eastern Shandong province, according to her Facebook profile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their daughter, Emily Han, was a kindergarten student at Foothill Elementary School in the Goleta area near their home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sheriff’s Office is expected to release an update midday on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Anyone with information regarding this case can call the Sheriff’s Office anonymous tip line at 805-681-4171.</i></b></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69098\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-25/names-of-triple-homicide-victims-released/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69098\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-25/names-of-triple-homicide-victims-released/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-25/names-of-triple-homicide-victims-released/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-25/names-of-triple-homicide-victims-released/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-25/names-of-triple-homicide-victims-released/","id":3914,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[3913,3912,3911],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
