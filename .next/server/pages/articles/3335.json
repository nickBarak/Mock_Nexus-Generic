He will be hoping for a national team call-up in the upcoming months if his form keeps up. Anchoring the midfield is Naby Keïta, and the box-to-box Guinean has four goals in his first year after joining from sister club Red Bull Salzburg in the summer window.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The impact that the Austrian manager has on his teams is measurable, too.

Bundesliga on 64 points, with six points to spare on automatic promotion. In his first season with the big dogs, most notably Bayern and Dortmund, the Austrian led Ingolstadt to an 11th place finish on 40 points, worry-free of the feared relegation zone as well as earning the boss among the league</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s four Manager of the Year finalists, next to Thomas Tuchel and Pep Guardiola.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A season later, and both Hasenh</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ü</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ttl and his former club</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s fortunes have shifted drastically. Since the parties went separate ways, Ingolstadt is in deep trouble, with just six points from their first 12 games. RB Leipzig, however, in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> maiden Bundesliga season, are undefeated with nine wins and three draws, miraculously three points ahead of Munich at the top of the table.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile Arsenal, who have been in fine form early on in the Premier League season, are being forced to search for a Wenger replacement. Rumors whirl about his retirement, which is becoming increasingly likely in the next year or two as one of the most graceful managers in football will soon end his historic career in fitting fashion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attractiveness of the Arsenal job is unfathomable, as it</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s a post that was never in serious question as long as the Frenchman was in charge.

SASA, per Reynolds, claimed during the town hall that this prohibits survivors from accessing areas integral to their education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA supports California Senate Bill 493, which, as Reynolds explained in the meeting, aims to ensure that sexual assault survivors have equal access to education through the abolition of mutual no-contact orders and resources for survivors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC currently does not support the abolition of mutual no-contact orders, SASA explained during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the panel discussion, Tallin Moyer, a member of SASA and Pi Beta Phi sorority, read a statement on sexual violence in Greek life and requested updates on other concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Greek life can provide a facility for leadership and self-growth — however, it is unacceptable that we as a Greek community have not realized the true magnititude of how our system enables sexual violence,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Members of Greek life need to realize how fraternities foster rape culture and put individual safety at risk. It is unacceptable to think these events have occurred in a vacuum.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public comment, one Greek life-affiliated student voiced her concerns about Sigma Pi’s participation in Arrowjam, an annual dance competition hosted by sorority Pi Beta Phi in order to raise money for Read &gt; Lead &gt; Achieve — a charity dedicated to children’s literacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moyer, whose sorority hosted the philanthropy, told the student that she understood the concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree with you, that was not taken into consideration at all, and I hear you, that it could be triggering to see them up there … It was the opinion of some of the women in our sorority that not all the men in Sigma Pi should be punished for the actions of a few. But I totally understand the concern, and [we] will be talking to our president about it,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sigma Pi went on to compete and win the fraternity portion of the competition, which occurred on Nov. 8, eight days before the SASA Town Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA also promoted its Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Map at the town hall. The map, facilitated by SASA, includes the UCSB campus and surrounding Isla Vista community. Anyone can anonymously report instances of sexual violence or harassment, which are pinned onto the digital map. Yellow pins stand for one report at a location and red stands for multiple. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s mostly faith-based, although I am cautious about calling it that, but we are in the sense of believing survivors. But we see everything that goes through, and we monitor it closely,” Moyer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds then inquired to administrators about the Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) training email, which was sent to the entire student body on Nov. 1, soon after a timely warning email was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sent out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about a reported sexual assault at Sigma Pi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We personally were concerned about the timeliness of the email about R.A.D., because obviously it was sent out during a very triggering, emotional time for many students,” she said. “The email only served to increase these feelings. We were also concerned that the email mentioned only women, which seemed to exclude men and gender non-conforming folks.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Ollman, representative for SBSO, explained that while the timing of the email was unfortunate, it had already been scheduled and pre-selected. R.A.D. training is heavily overviewed by the national organization and leaves little room for individual departments to change gender pronouns or create more inclusive wording, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explanation regarding email alerts for the student body was another topic of discussion throughout the town hall. UCSB has two forms of communication for alerts: emergency notifications and timely warnings, which fall under Clery Act jurisdiction. The Clery Act mandates public safety reports on specific crime categories, including sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency notifications are “designed to give information about ongoing threats,” UCPD’s Community Service Officer Ariel Bournes explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Timely Warning Notices fall under a different, highly specific category of warning, and failing to issue one that meets the criteria means a potential fine of up to $57,300, according to Associate Dean of Student Life Miles Ashlock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we become aware of something that violates the Clery Act, we are mandated to report it, simply because a report has been filed and not because it has been investigated. The university is mandated to send Clery warnings only about Clery crimes that occur on university property… it’s a really bizarre, unique set of circumstances,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also inquired about the safety prevention tips issued in one such timely warning, including covering one’s drink or never taking drinks from strangers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel like the burden is being placed on the survivor once again, especially when the tips are things like, ‘Cover your drink, don’t take drinks from strangers,’ she explained to Ashlock. “We know these things. These things aren’t new to us. You are expecting people to control their own safety, in a sense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlcok responded by stating that “one of the challenges of violence prevention education is coming at it from all these different angles.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to have a clear message against violence in the community. There is not one proven method of violence prevention. There are a lot of different things, and not all of them feel good even to us, but we want to provide a variety of tools so in aggregate we reduce the rates of violence in our community,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, many students still had concerns about the existence of sexual violence within UCSB’s Greek life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t just put a Band-Aid over this,” Moyer said in response to one student concerned about a lack of accountability within fraternities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To truly eradicate this culture and make a change, we can’t just remove one specific fraternity, but instead perform surgery on our culture as a Greek community.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

Life website. <em>Courtesy of Shoreline Website</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL), facilitated the initial change from paper information to OrgSync and now from OrgSync to Shoreline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he first started working at UC Santa Barbara in 2007, “the department was all paper — registration was on paper, financial transactions were paper, nothing but paper,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a simple online event-planning form that we used that we actually had to do in person with every single organization creating an event, but it was developed in the ‘90s, so the functionality was really limited,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSL then recognized a need for “a 21st-century system for student engagement” to digitize its process, Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When OSL first began to pursue digitized options, OrgSync was one of three software choices reviewed by OSL. As time went on, OrgSync was no longer properly serving the evolving needs of students from feedback the OSL had received, Ashlock said. Student organizations had trouble navigating the website and were not able to create their own sites, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, OSL began to look at different software options and found a program called CampusGroups, also known as Shoreline, Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is a student-engagement platform that doesn’t just serve the OSL, but it also serves departments in Student Affairs and across the campus and therefore is an engagement platform for every student,” Ashlock added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning from OrgSync to Shoreline had its fair share of problems, such as delays in shifting the information of organizations to the new platform, Ashlock said. The data renewal process took place last spring through a Google Form where current organizations could sign up and update their contact information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Unfortunately, we lost information for about 10 organizations,” Ashlock said. “We had reached out to them on multiple occasions to invite them to complete full registration in Shoreline and up to nearly 400 organizations have. We did mention that we did contact those organizations and say, ‘You have this much time to save your website data from OrgSync, but you will lose it otherwise.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said another issue limited the number of graduate students listed, but the problem has since been fixed and graduate students are now included in the database. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the faculty and staff are being loaded onto the platform this week as well, Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSL is also working toward using Shoreline to create a more functional check-in system for when a group hosts an event. Ashlock estimates that this new feature will be ready at the end of the quarter when OSL is finished with data integration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new check-in system will offer five different ways to sign into an event, depending on the event organizer, who can enable whichever option they choose, according to Ashlock. Students will be able to check in with a QR code provided through the Shoreline app or they can scan a QR code posted at the event; alternatively, they can scan, swipe or tap their Access Card for entry, Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a lot of versatility and all of those options can exist side by side,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone with an Access Card is going to be able to check-in and keep a log of events that they’ve attended.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shoreline website is currently available online for students, and an app is in development, which will provide access to student groups and student resources, such as </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho On-Line Data (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G.O.L.D.), GauchoSpace and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billing Accounts Receivable Collections (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BARC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s basically an instant messaging platform that merges student engagement and student resources,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we developed this app, we’re looking to create, even if it’s not just a single app, a more seamless environment where students can really go and get all the information they need in an efficient way.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article <span class=\"__in\">appeared</span> on page 5 of the Nov. 21, 2019 <span class=\"__in\">print</span> <span class=\"__in\">edition</span> of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
