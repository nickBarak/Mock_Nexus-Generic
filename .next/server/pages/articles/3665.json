I knew that this job is not being done right,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I came in with a plan and I think I executed it to the best of my abilities; setting deadlines, setting expectations, getting everyone trained. And in regard to that, I think I did quite a good job,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most noticeable shift between Adam and her predecessor, Steven Ho, was their efficiency during meetings. It was rare for a meeting to go past 10 p.m. for the 70th senate, with brief to little discussion for the vast majority of resolutions. Adam attributes this to a greater understanding of meetings through training on authoring resolutions and more emphasis on the “behind the scenes” work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was a senator, so many amendments were being made [in]to bills and resolutions the [same] night we were discussing them. And I just thought that was ridiculous,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said that if there were any problems with Legal Code or if a resolution was on a sensitive subject, she would meet with the authors beforehand to avoid a “whole drama-fest.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Wednesday night meetings were just the tip of the iceberg. A lot of the work was beforehand [and] behind the scenes and that’s why the meetings ran so smoothly,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you were going to put forward a bill or a resolution, it should be pretty clean by the time you submit it to the IVP, and the IVP should be reading each one, as I did, to make sure it followed Legal Code,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that behind the scenes work happens away from public view, which some said made for a lack of transparency to the senators’ constituency. Adam, however, said doing the hard work behind doors provided the “best result” for senators and their constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why would we show them something sloppy and controversial and that is divisive? If senators are representatives of the public and they can agree on something, then yeah, the public should be able to agree as well using that logic,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam says a lot of the work that went into the Senate’s resolutions was “pretty internal and administrative,” with many updates to the legal codes of Boards, Commissions and Units (BCUs), the student organizations that are within Associated Students (A.S.). Adam called these Legal Code changes “tangible effects” that reflect senators’ better relationships with BCUs than in years prior.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Adam began her term, there were </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/a-s-senate-fills-three-vacancies/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three vacancies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Senate: two on-campus senators and one College of Creative Studies Senator, a position that had been vacant for two years. Adam appointed an ad-hoc committee to fill them, and the positions were filled by October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam called the appointments a “team effort,” a theme mirrored throughout many of her accomplishments across the year. This took shape through the solid working relationships she built with her first pro tempore and second pro tempore — Off-Campus Senator Tianna White and On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman, respectively. Adam said the strong relationships allowed her to delegate some responsibilities meant for IVP to them, such as attending certain meetings on her behalf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite not making it to every meeting, Adam said she made herself available through daily office hours and email when she couldn’t be present physically.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transparency and availability in A.S. posed a challenge this spring with a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but Adam led the Senate’s shift to weekly Zoom meetings — what she described as a “touch and go situation” — and deemed that the transition was a success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said that that during her term as a senator she felt “pretty deflated within A.S.,” but in the end believes that she cut through a lot of noise to improve the association through her work as both a senator and IVP.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of changed the reputation of the Senate, that’s what I would boil it down to, to being much more student serving, much more respectful of each other, much more productive and much more professional.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for next year, with her first pro tempore White filling her shoes as IVP, Adam said she plans to stay in Santa Barbara.<br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really excited to stay in the area and maybe I’ll come back to a Senate meeting or two. You never know.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Main sometime in the next year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also continued the work of her predecessor Brooke Kopel in finding a permanent location for the A.S. Bike Shop. By the end of her term, Sir narrowed down a final location for the shop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir’s Strategic Vision Task Force met weekly to reassess the Strategic Vision 2020, a project first started by 2013-2014 A.S. President Jonathan Abboud. The project aimed to revamp the way A.S. addresses the larger student body through increased accessibility, outreach and transparency, she said.

Many student leaders and groups criticized administrators for not being transparent about the allegations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said she spoke to several members of the administration about students’ concerns; the administration, in response, created a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-04/task-force-for-safer-social-events-in-i-v-meets-for-second-time-to-hear-updates-about-new-ifc-regulations-university-communications/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safer Social Events in Isla Vista</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> task force to improve safety at social events in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir, a member of Greek life herself, emphasized that the task force still has a great deal of work to do in terms of making Isla Vista safer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, when the end of Winter Quarter 2020 hit, Sir said she and her fellow executives compiled testimonials from students’ whose professors had refused to cancel in-person finals, despite the university asking instructors to make alternate arrangements, back when the university initially planned for </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students to return at the end of April</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said she and the executives then brought those testimonials to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, who allowed them to witness calls he then placed to each professor, “trying to persuade [professors], ‘Hey, this is what students are feeling.

COVID-19 Response Task Force to help centralize all communications and project proposals related to the coronavirus. The task force, chaired by Senate First Pro Tempore Tianna White and Sir’s Chief of Staff Adam Chohan, held its first weekly meeting on May 4. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The task force was able to grant Student Health money for face masks and help students figure out where to request additional grants from A.S. She added that herself and her fellow executives sent out a survey that was later used to create a list of resources specific to different student groups on campus, such as transfer students and undocumented students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“40% of the job is showing up and being present with what students need in front of the administration,” she said. “I feel like I’ve definitely done that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir’s successor, A.S.

While I have always been happy to speak with students throughout my term, the way in which I’ve been contacted and the words people have chosen to approach me with are extremely inappropriate,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Izzy Mitchell, a second-year communication and economics double major who created a petition to recall Beasley from office, said she has reached out to Sir both on social media and through messages to Sir herself, according to Mitchell’s social media account, Gauchos4Transparency. Mitchell has been calling for all A.S. senators and executives to release statements regarding the allegation against Beasley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir received backlash from students on social media after putting out her statement, with several pointing to one of her platform points – transparency – as a reason why she should keep them open. Sir declined to comment further about why she put her social media accounts on lockdown. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

As UC Santa Barbara’s representative for the student body at the statewide and national level, he said his overall goal was to make sure “that students are [aware of] these issues that affect them at those levels.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the year, Beasley said he picked up other projects, such as the fight against the construction of the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-22/students-condemn-uc-and-chancellor-yangs-involvement-in-thirty-meter-telescope-express-support-for-native-hawaiians/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty Meter Telescope</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (TMT) in Hawaii.

Yang’s involvement with the telescope project, and in turn, make Yang aware of students’ discontent with the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While his work surrounding TMT was not part of his original platform, Beasley said spreading awareness about the project was one of his proudest accomplishments of the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Life comes at you fast and at any moment you could have all of that thrown up in the air,” Beasley said. “And I was like, ‘Okay, I’m going to put this platform point to the side and focus on what students are actually suffering through right now.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on his work with TMT, Beasley said the biggest lesson he learned came from amplifying student voices through proper representation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you want to advocate for people that aren’t in the room, you need to bring them into the room. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t have them there with you,” he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s EVPSA office also saw the creation of its first organizing department, which serves to support other student organizations on campus by providing funding and assistance, Beasley said. Creating a new arm for the executive office required the office to rewrite portions of A.S. Legal Code, but Beasley said he believed the change helped to strengthen the office as a whole.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s EVPSA office also had the opportunity to tap into the United States Student Association (USSA) budget, which Beasley said allowed him to allocate $30,000 to UCSB Lobby Corps to cover the group’s lobbying trips and increase the number of Washington D.C. and Sacramento trips the group could take. Because USSA has not hosted any events since 2018, Beasley said the lock-in fee language surrounding the organization permits him to access its budget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the extra funding, Beasley said the EVPSA office also collaborated with UCSB’s Human Rights Board to host a Criminal Justice Lobby Day, in which group members flew to D.C. to “talk to legislators about legalizing marijuana at the federal level,” along with other criminal justice reforms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said his office also saw success in other areas as well. This year’s EVPSA office was the first to fully fund the UCSB Black Student Union’s annual Afrikan Black Coalition Conference and also hosted 22 A.S. fellows — the most of any of the five executive offices, Beasley said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Beasley noted that he did have some difficulty with the Students of Color Conference in fall quarter. The event is organized by the UC Student Association (UCSA), and each UC’s Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) typically sends a delegation of students. Beasley said there were issues coordinating between UCSA and UCSB S.C.O.R.E., calling it “one of the top three toughest moments” of this past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley added that the coronavirus pandemic upended his plans for spring quarter. He said he had planned on hosting UCSB’s Gender Bias Summit with Students Against Sexual Assault President and EVPSA-elect Alia Reynolds, as well as attending the annual Student Lobby Conference (SLC), which he said is one of the EVPSA office’s largest events of the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of concern for student safety amid the coronavirus pandemic, Beasley said SLC was canceled following a vote from UCSA’s Executive Vice President representatives from each UC, including Beasley. The cancellation of SLC resulted in about $80,000 of unanswered refund requests for hotel reservations, which Beasley said wiped out UCSA’s “entire rainy day fund.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from canceled events, the timing of the coronavirus pandemic — which threw </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">winter quarter finals week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into a frenzy — left many students on edge about the nature of finals week. During this time, Beasley said he worked with A.S. President Alison Sir to create a Google form to field questions and concerns from students about the status of their exams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After accumulating over 250 responses, Beasley said he and Sir arranged a meeting with Yang, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and the chair of the Academic Senate, Henning Bohn, to review the student concerns and explore alternatives to in-person finals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got to the meeting and it was very high tension. Chancellor Yang was obviously under a lot of stress and pressure. He said he had faculty hitting him from all sides, saying that ‘you can’t force us to do an online course or do ProctorU or do this or do that,’” Beasley said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But he was also trying to level with us as students to do what was best for us,” he said, adding that he and Sir stressed to Yang that students are key stakeholders in the success of the university and that “faculty only exist on the campus because of students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After relaying student testimonies and continuing discussions with the Academic Senate and UCSB administration, Beasley said the university decided to allow professors a choice: either move all finals online or cancel them entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on his year as a whole, Beasley said the one thing he would change about his office is its accessibility to students. “Of course when you hear ‘A.S. President,’ you’re like, ‘Okay, they’re the ones who are supposed to advocate for me,’” but far too often, he said, students forget that other executive offices may be a better fit for their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds will be sworn in as the new EVPSA during tonight’s Senate meeting. Beasley said he hopes that Reynolds will expand the EVPSA office and use it to “continue connecting with the marginalized groups on campus, to learn about cultural issues outside of her comfort zone and to keep an open mind to new challenges and experiences.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

One of them was the 2006 NCAA Division I National Coach of the Year—a.k.a., UCSB’s very own head coach, Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg’s familiarity with Cal Poly dates back to 1985 when he began playing collegiate soccer for UCSB. Now into his 20th year at the helm of the soccer program, the seasoned coach is able to look back at 30+ years of match-ups and observe the evolution of the rivalrous nature between the programs.</p>\n<p>“We’ve always had kind of a natural rivalry against them because of the location and distance. Even back when I played, it was always a game that we used to always want to play,” Vom Steeg reflects.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s program, however, never quite matched the level of Santa Barbara’s. Before officially meeting UCSB in Big West Conference play in 1996, it made its way through Division II and did not enter Division I until 1994.</p>\n<p>Preoccupied with their in-conference battle with Cal State Northridge for top-seed, the Gauchos paid little attention to the Mustangs’ entering. Vom Steeg recalls, “When they joined Big West…we didn’t think much about Cal Poly.” He acknowledges that Santa Barbara’s “general success” over them fed into the maturing feud.</p>\n<p>Upon the series of events in 2007 as aforementioned, however, the rivalry escalated to a level beyond prediction.</p>\n<p>Over the years, it has materialized into packed stadiums and rowdy crowds, distasteful screaming of ironic slogans like “Cuck Fal Poly”, and an ungodly amount of tortillas thrown-to-waste.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg carefully makes an important distinction between how the UCSB-Cal Poly rivalry takes form at Alex. G. Spanos Stadium versus that at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“The fans up at Cal Poly…are there mainly to…have a big party. They turn it…a little bit more into just an event that you get a bunch of people together and scream and yell,” he states matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>For a number of reasons, traveling to Cal Poly is hardly an enjoyable experience for the team. The close quartered football-turned-soccer field subjects them to audible criticisms from thousands of hovering fans.</p>\n<p>Up in SLO, Vom Steeg continues, “The referees are usually more emotional. The last two years we’ve had water bottles thrown at us. If you happen to lose the game, [the fans] jump over the side…It’s really hard to play naturally [and]…easy to make it hard to play soccer.”</p>\n<p>Silencing the infamous crowd remains one of his most memorable moments at Spanos Stadium. In 2009, senior Chris Pontius scored seconds into double overtime to win the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“The whole place was just absolutely quiet. Chris ran around the whole stadium, we were chasing him as he was celebrating, and the whole place was dead quiet,” he gladly recounted.</p>\n<p>In the coach’s eyes, Harder Stadium harbors a much more authentic environment for the team. The professional-like layout opens up the field while separating the players from the overwhelming crowds.</p>\n<p>He mostly appreciates the fans’—comprised of both students and locals—knowledge of the actual game, noting, “It feels like a soccer game. The cheering is about good plays on the field,” as compared to screaming about the opponent’s mistakes.</p>\n<p>This aspect, among others, was one of the driving factors in Vom Steeg’s decision in 1999 to take control of a struggling program that had, in the season prior to his arrival, merely two wins and 17 losses to its name.</p>\n<p>Ironically, Vom Steeg’s first time coaching UCSB was against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>20 years later, the accomplished coach has deep-rooted ties to Santa Barbara and holds some of the biggest accolades in collegiate soccer.</p>\n<p>He is a two-time NCSAA National Coach of the Year and a five-time Big West Coach of the Year. Under the reigns of Vom Steeg, UCSB made it into the Sweet 16 of NCAA four times and even hosted and won an NCAA Championship along the way.</p>\n<p>Talking about the essential creation of and dedication to the soccer program, Vom Steeg notes,</p>\n<p>“The big key for me has been the amount of work, the energy we’ve put in, the relationships we developed. The idea of starting over again has kept me from looking [at other options]. I’d rather keep enjoying what we’ve built here, and I still think there’s room for us to get better.”</p>\n<p>More specifically, this hard work has contributed to the establishment of Santa Barbara’s winning record over Cal Poly; one that, as of recently however, has begun to deteriorate.</p>\n<p>Now awaiting the 41st matchup, Vom Steeg hopes to break the sense of complacency that has overwhelmed the Gauchos’ gameplay in the past years. Upon the hiring of former US National coach Steve Sampson, Cal Poly has strategically and effectively dulled the matchups against their blue and gold rival. The result? Four straight draws at Harder Stadium since 2014, the latest two finalizing with scores of 0-0.</p>\n<p>To rationalize SLO’s gameplay, Vom Steeg points out, “When you get caught in a situation where maybe you’re not sure your talent matches up, you do things on the field to make it really hard to play.”</p>\n<p>He continues, “It’s up to us this year to, more than ever, try to figure out how we can make it into a more exciting soccer game than what it’s been.”</p>\n<p>Coach Tim Vom Steeg hopes to disrupt this pattern of stagnancy with a sweet victory over the Mustangs. After all, the win could be the 258th of his career, 24th against their program, and the key to unleashing the prideful insanity that the community has so eagerly awaited to display.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84555\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84555\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/","id":3664,"author":{"id":283,"name":"Annika Pearson"},"related":[3663,3662,3661],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
