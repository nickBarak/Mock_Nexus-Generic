I was pretty stumped on what to write about and how to write it. In the past when I didn’t know what to write on, I’d choose something that I am very passionate about, usually in-depth baseball articles. However, I thought that my last article required a broader topic with a little bit more of a grandiose style. So I was thinking about trying to incorporate my graduation, and subsequent departure from UCSB, into an article about sports. So here it is.</p>\n<p>Last week I wrote an article on the New York Yankees’ closer Mariano Rivera. I discussed his announcement that he will retire after this season, and that he leads the American League with 18 saves at the age of 43. That article made me realize that I’m at a point in my life where I am seeing the turnover from one sports generation to the next. Very soon the days of Kobe Bryant, Peyton Manning, Derek Jeter, Tom Brady, Kevin Garnett and Mariano Rivera, among so many others, will be gone.</p>\n<p>If I were younger when I realized that the sports generation that I grew up idolizing was leaving, I would have been devastated. I would have resisted such a monumental change to my world. I would have found myself desperately holding on to all of the observations, beliefs and feelings on players, teams and strategies that I had just witnessed retire. Then I finally realized that these observations, beliefs and feelings were outdated. My fantasy league rosters, sports video game performance and everyday sports arguments were slowly withering. I can’t watch and form intelligent opinions on today’s sports with the same observations, beliefs and feelings that I have gathered from the previous generation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So here is the epiphany. The reason why I love sports and why they are truly genuine is because sport and competition is progress. Humans are imperfect, so we love to see the pursuit toward it. We are attracted to perfection. Sport and competition is the constant struggle for perfection — the struggle to beat everyone and to be on top. The sports world is run by the Goliath dynasties who write the history books through their success, but it is the underdog that we need. The underdog is the progress, the player/team/idea that upsets the status quo and keeps the sports world going. I have learned to embrace the new and young with the knowledge of our past. Don’t try to maintain success or become complacent; always get better because everyday there is an underdog working to beat you.</p>\n<p>So in light of graduation, don’t fear or be saddened by leaving UCSB; keep it alive and build on your experience. Don’t be complacent with the thought that UCSB was the lone high point in your life and everything is downhill from here. Live for the pursuit, and for the good times yet to come. Don’t be sad it’s over. Be happy it happened. If we can do that, we can give leaving UCSB, Isla Vista, our new friends and all of our memories a purpose.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/","id":3214,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3213,3212,3211],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore","biography":"Not available","articles":[679,699,1785,2103,2115,2116,3183,3186,3187,3209,3214,4499,4540,5123,5153,5154,5155,5156,5157,5158,5159,5161,5163,5165,5166,5168,5169,5170,5171,5172],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Here We Buy, Here We Stay","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kings-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kings-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I have to say, I thought they were gone.

This vote came a little over a week after the relocation committee had unanimously recommended the team stay in Sacramento.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Maloofs settled on the Sacramento group to take the reins and has signed a deal.</p>\n<p>The team from the Pacific Northwest is being sold for an NBA record $535 million. Vivek Ranadive, the head of the new ownership, will purchase the 65 percent share currently owned by the Maloofs and their business partner, Robert Hernreich. Nevertheless, the Maloofs are in so much debt, owing approximately $150 million to the city of Sacramento and the NBA, that they will receive about $200 million.</p>\n<p>One clear advantage Sacramento seemed to have in gaining the relocation committee’s recommendation is the continued support and loyalty for the Kings since it came to Sacramento in 1985.</p>\n<p>With 19 sellout seasons, the Kings own one of the longest streaks in NBA history. But even more than that, the fans have shown incredible support during the time when the team was vulnerable and the team’s future was unknown.</p>\n<p>Taking the slogans of “Here We Buy” and “Here we Stay,” Sacramento fans were going to make it difficult to have their team stolen away. On Feb. 9, Kings fans orchestrated a “Here We Buy” night, selling out the arena with more than 16,000 fans to watch the Kings beat the Utah Jazz. For a not so great team to sell out against another mediocre team in Utah, now that’s dedication. And after the game, fans stayed put, rallying and not giving up.</p>\n<p>Then, during the Board of Governors meeting, Sacramento paid to have a 30-second ad supporting the city’s bid to keep the Kings playing every five minutes in Times Square.</p>\n<p>Even as the season came to an end, fans didn’t let up. After the final game of the season against the Clippers, fans once again didn’t leave their seats, staying an hour after the game with chants of “Here We Stay” and “Sacramento.” It was all that could be talked about, even in the Clippers broadcast post-game show.</p>\n<p>Leading the show though for Sacramento has been Mayor Kevin Johnson. And really, he hasn’t been given enough credit for what he’s put together in such a short amount of time. The retired Phoenix Suns guard had to act fast and with efficiency to combat a strong bid from Seattle.</p>\n<p>And even when it seemed all hope was gone and NBA Commissioner David Stern had announced Sacramento’s offer was nothing close to that of Seattle’s, Johnson continued to work around the clock. He’s been part of putting together the arena deal and of course was monumental in pitching everything to the committee. If there’s one guy who Sacramento owes a few extra thank you’s to, it is without a doubt Johnson.</p>\n<p>The deal is arguably the best possible scenario for the Kings. They get rid of the horrible owners, get fresh faces, a new start and remain in a city that loves them.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the team might be becoming free of the Maloofs, who have owned the majority interest in the team since 1999. In the last year, the Maloof name has become known like a cuss word or even have become used as verb meaning “to mess up.”</p>\n<p>The people that were once loved by the city and known for attending every Kings game have been MIA for a while now. They are clearly broke, which should’ve been obvious the second they could no longer afford the cheaper WNBA Sacramento Monarchs.</p>\n<p>At that time, they also began their lying, which has continued up until the team was sold. When the team was unanimously recommended to stay in California’s capital city, the Maloofs threatened to keep the Kings unless relocation was approved and they could sell to the Hansen and Ballmer group, only to announce how pleased they were to sell to the Sacramento group after relocation was denied.</p>\n<p>In addition, Ranadive becomes the first Indian-born owner in the NBA’s history. He already has ownership experience as part of the group that bought the Golden State Warriors and as a result was involved in building their arena.</p>\n<p>With Ranadive’s background, the Kings could also open up a new way of marketing the NBA globally, as the NBA is looking into reaching India.</p>\n<p>While the Maloofs certainly needed to go, the next person to be dismissed will probably be general manager Geoff Petrie. His contract is up and, to be honest, he should’ve been given the boot years ago. The only problem was that the Maloofs were too blind to see it.</p>\n<p>For years, Petrie has slacked doing his job, giving away all the players from the glory days and getting nothing in return. Sacramento fans, you can thank Petrie for the fact that your team has been battling to stay out of the cellar in the Western Conference. He may have been brilliant at one time, bringing in Chris Webber and Bibby and the great Kings we all know, but ever since, he’s been almost worthless.</p>\n<p>Although Head Coach Keith Smart still has one year left on his contract, he is also likely to be dismissed, leaving a fresh start for the Kings, which is exactly what it needs. Finally, there is hope to returning to the glory days. The team is not only very young, but well under the salary gap and therefore will have plenty of money to bring in some talent.</p>\n<p>Finally, the last thing the Kings will get with the deal is a brand new arena. Arco Arena (for true fans it will never be anything else) is a loved building in Sacramento, but seeing some of the newer arenas around the NBA, it really is in bad shape. The Kings’ future includes a $447 million downtown arena that will be built at the western gateway to the city near the Sacramento River.</p>\n<p>Seattle does absolutely deserve a team. There’s no arguing that. Those fans were also very loyal to their team and had it taken away, but they just can’t have ours.</p>\n<p>The best option would be expansion. Throughout the battle for the Kings, Stern was adamant that there would be no expansion, but it is a logical idea. Seattle would get its team and there are plenty of other viable cities that could be picked from to round out the NBA to a total of 32 teams. That would mean two conferences of 16 teams and four divisions of four teams. Half the teams make the playoffs, half don’t. It all makes sense.</p>\n<p>Of course, now that the deal is done, Stern has praised Seattle’s proposal and is saying that the league might consider expansion if a new TV deal could be made. Stern covered his back keeping another team from relocating under his reign. To expand would be another possible positive action he could take before retiring next year.</p>\n<p>Besides, if the Kings had relocated, they would’ve become the SuperSonics and the entire history of Sacramento would disappear.</p>\n<p>So live on the great memories in Sacramento — the cowbells being so loud that opposing teams hated playing in Sacramento and the great rivalry between the Kings and Lakers. Live on the legacies of the great players that have played there — Mitch Richmond, Mike Bibby, Peja Stojakovic, Bobby Jackson, Doug Christie, Chris Webber and Vlade Divac. And live on the idea that the Sacramento Kings could one day win a NBA championship.</p>\n<p>For people like me and all the people in Sacramento, this is our team and they are finally here to stay.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of My 20th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51449\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51449\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/","id":3211,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3210,3209,3208],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB To Begin Loco Rewards Program","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Gaucho-Rewards.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Gaucho-Rewards.jpg?resize=600%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Walking into Harder Stadium for the first men’s soccer game of the year in 2010, 15,896 fans packed the stadium and created a lasting first impression of UCSB athletics for any newly initiated Gauch...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Walking into Harder Stadium for the first men’s soccer game of the year in 2010, 15,896 fans packed the stadium and created a lasting first impression of UCSB athletics for any newly initiated Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB upset No. 13 UCLA 2-0, sending a unified crowd clad in gold into a total frenzy, complete with tortillas flying through the air.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has led the national attendance mark for men’s soccer for six consecutive seasons.

The Loco Rewards program is an incentivizing campaign to get students more involved in UCSB athletics.</p>\n<p>For the price of under $10 per quarter, this year-long program involves multiple free giveaways, beginning with one soccer-themed and one basketball-themed T-shirt. This is the same style T-shirt that has been given out at the first men’s soccer game in previous years.</p>\n<p>Like in years past, the shirt will be gold, and if you wear it certain on days, there will be deals in participating Isla Vista restaurants to receive either free or discounted items.</p>\n<p>In addition, the rewards program includes free bus rides and admission to the away Cal Poly soccer game and the Big West Basketball Tournament.</p>\n<p>As a rewards program, the more events students attend, the more points they will accumulate, resulting in a chance to win unique prizes such as iPads, flat-screen TVs and Nike apparel.</p>\n<p>With all of these incentives along with game-day giveaways, any student who is part of the Loco Rewards program will surely receive more value out of the program than the monetary amount they put in at the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>The vision of the athletic department is not only to increase attendance at UCSB athletic events, but to expand student enthusiasm and unity, as was displayed at the UCLA game.</p>\n<p>For example, in the glory days of UCSB basketball when the Gauchos defeated No. 1 UNLV, the Thunderdome was the place to be. Glimpses of this energetic atmosphere certainly have occurred in the last two to three years, such as against Long Beach State or Cal Poly, but we would hope this rewards program would help to bring back this fervor at UCSB athletic events.</p>\n<p>Even by attending one or two events, such as a softball game or a water polo match, students will have an opportunity to win worthwhile prizes. They will not be exclusively for the students who attend the most events, like the Gaucho Locos.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, as students we have the privilege of attending all UCSB athletic events for free. For most schools, Associated Students cover the cost of student tickets in their budget, but UCSB Athletics bears the burden here in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>At several institutions, students even pay to attend sporting events such as basketball games. Here, the UCSB athletic department provides the student body with 35,000 free tickets each year for a $350,000 value.</p>\n<p>The first men’s soccer game after students return to Isla Vista will be against Stanford on Sept. 27, where the attendance is expected to be over 10,000. This will be the biggest opportunity to be a part of the Loco Rewards program.</p>\n<p>As students, we want to bring awareness and gain more UCSB student’s perspectives on this program. Let us know what you think and leave a comment online. After all, it is a program for the students.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 23, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51534\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51534\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/","id":3212,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3211,3210,3209],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Top Five Reasons to Watch the WNBA This Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The WNBA turns 17 today with the tip-off to a new season.

Headlined by the “Three to See” in Brittney Griner, Elena Delle Donne and Skylar Diggins, these rookies are going to make huge impacts on their teams right away.</p>\n<p>At 6’8’’ and the ability to really dunk, Griner is going to change women’s basketball. The obvious No. 1 pick in the draft, she brings a defensive presence to a Phoenix team that’s already plenty deep with talent.</p>\n<p>Delle Donne has the versatility that will allow her to become a great player in the WNBA. Though not 6’8’’ like Griner, at 6’5’’ Delle Donne is no slouch in the post, but she can also score from anywhere on the court and has the ball handling skills of a guard.</p>\n<p>Then, there’s point guard Diggins, who can get in the lane or drain the three-point shot. She brings leadership to a Tulsa team that should have a successful season since moving from Detroit.</p>\n<p>All in all, the rookies this year won’t be sitting on the bench but will be determining the success of their franchises.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Competitive Games Every Night</strong></p>\n<p>The WNBA only has 12 teams with six in each conference, so that means that every team is stacked. Unlike in the NBA, there’s no taking a night off. With the WNBA season only being 35 games long, every night counts when determining those coveted four playoff spots in each conference.</p>\n<p>In the past, there were teams like Tulsa or Washington that were always in the cellar of their respective conferences, but not this year. Trades and the WNBA draft have taken care of that. Of course, there are still frontrunners in the league, but every night is going to be a competitive battle and a fun game to watch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Phoenix Mercury</strong></p>\n<p>Possibly the biggest frontrunner in the WNBA is the Phoenix Mercury. After a disappointing season last year, in which the entire starting lineup was injured for the majority of the year, the Mercury acquired the No.1 draft pick and therefore picked up the incredible Griner. Griner will certainly be huge. As a run-and-gun team that in 40 minutes would prefer to score into the 100s (they average more points per minute than most NBA teams), Griner will bring a defensive presence to the squad and her rebounding will simply facilitate the fast break.</p>\n<p>However, even as the future of the WNBA, Griner isn’t the focus of Phoenix because they also happen to feature the best player in the world: Diana Taurasi. The scoring champion almost every year since entering the league, Taurasi can take her defender off the dribble or will sink NBA-range threes. Possibly the biggest competitor in the league and with every basketball award/accomplishment already, she has incredible strength and a great basketball IQ.</p>\n<p>Add to that the versatility of Australian Penny Taylor, Candice Dupree, young point guard Samantha Prahalis and DeWanna Bonner, and you’ve got a Mercury team that’s going to be nearly unstoppable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Indiana Fever</strong></p>\n<p>If there’s one team that could take the Mercury down, it’s the defending champions, the Indiana Fever. The Fever are always competitive. Leading the team is the WNBA’s best defender, Tamika Catchings. She wreaks havoc on the other team on the defensive end as the league’s all-time steals leader but on the offensive end can kill you, too. She is comfortable playing in the post or on the wing and can absolutely change a game.</p>\n<p>Her running mate, Katie Douglas, returns after spraining her ankle in the Eastern Conference Finals last year. Yes, the Fever went on to win a title without one of their best players. Douglas, who is a pure shooter and clutch handling the ball, will certainly have some motivation to win another title, as she wasn’t able to be on the court to win her first last year.</p>\n<p>Last season, to win it all, the bench players had to step up, and they did. It created a Cinderella-story ending to the season and all those players returns. Indiana is a veteran squad with plenty of weapons, so while Phoenix on paper may be the team to beat, never count out Indiana.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>An Extended Three-Point Line</strong></p>\n<p>As one of the rule changes to this season, the WNBA is moving back its three-point line. The arc moves from 20 feet, 6-1/4 inches to 22, 1-3/4 inches, the same as the international distance. While moving the line back might make some people think there will be fewer threes, I don’t think fans will see a decrease at all. Virtually all WNBA players play overseas during the offseason and are therefore accustomed to this distance. Even with the old line, there were players making NBA-distance threes.</p>\n<p>With the three-point line moved out, this will only spread the court more and give more space for the players to work with. Plus, it’s another movement toward showing that the women can really play.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So, for anybody that’s never watched the WNBA, I suggest you give it a chance. It’s definitely going to be a season to remember.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/","id":3213,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3212,3211,3210],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
