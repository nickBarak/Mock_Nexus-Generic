Senior goalkeeper Sam Hayden, who recorded his 20th shutout of his career against Duke, will be the Gauchos’ stopper in the net this time after being forced to sit on the bench for a red-card suspension in the earlier meeting. Sophomore forward Sam Garza, who leads the team in goals, shots and overall points, will also meet the Aggies for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>“Now we’ve got [Hayden] and Garza back, but they’ve won three games in a row so they have some momentum now,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “On top of that, it’s the first night game they’ve played in the history of their program because of football. They always draw well, but there will definitely be a lot of people there.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A lot of people for Davis, though, is not a lot of people for Santa Barbara. Harder has already held three matches this season with over 6,000 fans — two of which had over 10,000 — a record among all Division I soccer programs in the country. Possibly as a result, it took the Gauchos until this Sunday in Riverside to defeat a home team outside fan-and-tortilla-filled Harder.</p>\n<p>“Playing outside the confines of Harder without the crowd, without the atmosphere, it’s not easy to get yourself up for these games sometimes,” senior defender Michael Boxall said. “But we’ve thrown enough games away on the road that we have to approach each game the same way we would Duke or UCLA because these are all big games.”</p>\n<p>With just four matches left in the regular season, all of them against conference opponents, UCSB has only a handful of chances to secure a top seed in its conference tournament in November. Currently, the Gauchos are on top of the Big West, ahead of UC Irvine (3-0-1). Davis is tied with Cal State Fullerton in third place with a conference record of 3-2.</p>\n<p>“How we won [in Riverside], being down a goal right off the bat and being down 3-2 with 20 minutes left gives you a real big boost of confidence,” Vom Steeg said. “It helps to kind of carry you through the season when you have to fight like that. Every one of these games is tough for us, and the road games are even harder because of our crowd and the energy, so we’ll have to bring that energy tomorrow night.”</p>\n<p>One source of energy for the Gauchos will be junior midfielder Danny Barrera, who has registered 265 minutes out of a possible 270 in the team’s last three matches. In those matches, he scored two of the Gauchos’ three game-winning goals, including a 75th-minute blast that solidified a 4-3 win for UCSB against Riverside.</p>\n<p>“He fits in with the rest of the players now,” Vom Steeg said. “We kind of found the right spot for him on the field and know how to get him the ball in that position. Danny is playing well but it’s a function of the team playing well too.”</p>\n<p>UCSB leads the Big West in goals, shots, points, assists and corners so far this season, out shooting opponents 104-41. Against an Aggie squad with a win streak of their own, tonight’s game could be a struggle.</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7:15 p.m. tonight before UCSB welcomes Cal State Northridge to Harder Stadium on Saturday night.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

of Malware” in the Pacific View Room tonight at 4 p.m. as part of the Davidson Library’s Pacific Views: Library Speaker Series.</p>\n<p>Vigna is the co-founder and CTO of Lastline, co-director of the Security Lab and director of the Center for CyberSecurity at UCSB. Vigna’s talk on malware, short for malicious software, will discuss research being developed to fight cybercriminals who quickly adapt to countermeasures being deployed in cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>According to Vigna, the lecture will focus on four key questions: “What is malware?,” “How does it operate?,” “How does it affect us?” and “How can the average person protect themselves?”</p>\n<p>“Everyone is susceptible to malware,” Vigna said. “If you’re on the Internet you will be attacked one way or another and it’s important to know how it works.”</p>\n<p>Vigna said the damage caused by malware varies in strength but can create major repercussions, especially for students.</p>\n<p>“Malware can steal personal information, like your bank info, and sell it in the underground market for money,” Vigna said. “They could encrypt your files and ask for a ransom. If you do not have a backup you will not be able to get your files back, which can be especially troublesome for students who may have a project or a big paper due the next day.”</p>\n<p>According to Vigna, writing malware is as difficult as coding any other computer program, varying in strength and complexity depending on the developer’s experience.</p>\n<p>“It takes skill when you want do something very sophisticated that hides its presence very well,” Vigna said. “There is very simple malware … and there is other sophisticated malware that goes deep into the operating system.”</p>\n<p>Vigna said that protecting against malware is a competition between defense and attacker because the superior program comes out on top.</p>\n<p>“You’re against another person trying to make your stuff work against his; it is a battle against one another,” Vigna said. “It’s an arms race.”</p>\n<p>Vigna also said malware changes at a rapid rate because it, and the products developed to detect it, is continuously evolving.</p>\n<p>“We come out with new techniques to detect malware and they’ll come out with new techniques from our techniques, and we have to come out with new way to find theirs,” Vigna said. “It’s continued evolution.”</p>\n<p>First-year film and media studies major Andrew Okeh said students should take cybersecurity classes in high school because they depend on computers now more than generations before them.</p>\n<p>“With this increase in computer use it would be wise to implement basic ‘safe online behavior classes,’ like how we learn about having safe sex,” Okeh said. “I mean it is 2015! Practices like installing anti-malware software, updating computers, not using random networks or downloading stuff from sketchy websites.”</p>\n<p>Second-year computer science major Dylan Lynch said he is interested in attending Vigna’s talk because cyber security is relevant to anyone who uses the Internet.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited to attend the talk because I think computer security is growing to be a really lucrative field,” Lynch said. “It’s very relevant because of all the companies people trust with their personal information.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/prof-to-talk-on-malware-cybersecurity/","id":2804,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2803,2802,2801],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Meeting Discusses Term Lengths","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stakeholder_Alexander-Payne-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stakeholder_Alexander-Payne-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista residents, county representatives and UC Santa Barbara Associated Students met Tuesday night in the I.V.

Clinic Building for the weekly self-governance meeting held by Assemblyman Das Williams’ office to discuss plans to develop I.V. into a Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Stakeholders discussed whether CSD governing board members would serve two-year or four-year terms. According to the language in Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 to establish I.V. as a CSD, all board members would serve four-year terms. With an informal hand vote Tuesday, attendees voted to have one two-year and four four-year board member positions.</p>\n<p>Discussions at previous meetings suggested one of the five elected board members should be appointed by UCSB and another by Santa Barbara County. Stakeholders also continued the discussion from previous weeks on how to set official boundaries for I.V. as a CSD and several attendees expressed preference for including UCSB buildings, such as university-owned apartments and residence halls, within the boundaries of the proposal.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Senator and second-year history of public policy Paola Dela Cruz said setting a two-year term candidacy for board members would allow more students to run for a position on the board.</p>\n<p>“Just looking at the students who have run for Park District, I think most of them are not first years,” Dela Cruz said.  “Generally it’s second years or third years so that by the time they graduate they have either two or three years on the board. Personally, I think having a two-year position makes it easier.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez said he agrees a two-year term would be suitable, and board members who wish to serve longer could run for consecutive terms.</p>\n<p>“I would probably not run for something that was four years if I was only planning on staying in for two years,” Lopez said. “Couldn’t you just run again for re-election if you wanted to stay another two years?”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk, the two-year position was suggested to address the concern that student board members lack dedication and knowledge.</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve been pretty clear that the goal of that position is to avoid student transiency,” Schunk said. “Let’s address the elephant in the room: we’re worried students won’t be educated enough and informed enough to make decisions on the board.”</p>\n<p>While Schunk said one potential way to develop board members’ experience would be to establish a year-long trial period, during which time their votes will not count towards decisions being made by the board, the proposal was voted down by attendees.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how this works as far as constitutionality or whether it’s legal,” Schunk said. “We could say you have a year where you can’t vote but you are still expected to show up because you are a member of the board.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, including UCSB in the official boundaries of the proposed CSD would pressure the university to make a decision regarding their involvement in I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>“To me, including them in the boundaries makes it really clear,” Schunk said. “They can either say they don’t want to be in these boundaries and we can ask them why they don’t want to, or they can say they do and we can come back as a group and ask if we want to let them in.”</p>\n<p>Longtime I.V. resident Pegeen Soutar said she does not feel comfortable allowing short-term residents living in UCSB-owned properties to have representation in I.V. governance.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want people who have not lived in Isla Vista to be making decisions about things that happen out here that they don’t have first-hand knowledge of yet,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p>Because of time constraints, stakeholders made no decision concerning CSD boundaries and chose to continue the discussion at a later meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62890\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62890\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/meeting-discusses-term-lengths/","id":2805,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2804,2803,2802],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senators look on as they hear funding requests from campus organizations. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met in the State Street Room of the University Center on Friday to address funding requests regarding reallocation and cultural events.</p>\n<p>Prior to the meeting, the Office of Student Life (OSL) budget responsible for funding campus clubs stood at $0, the Senate Unallocated Budget used mainly for A.S. financial matters stood at $2,872 and the Graduation and Culture week budget stood at $8,831. Of the three clubs requesting funding, the Black Student Union (BSU) received the full request for $4,300 from the Culture and Graduation budget. The Queer People of Color Collective and Active Minds did not receive funding. The committee also granted a request to reallocate funding for an upcoming Sigma Pi Epsilon fraternity fundraiser.</p>\n<p>Black Culture Week co-chair and second-year black studies major Mikayla Williams said BSU’s Black Culture Week event will kick-off with a barbeque May 18 and include several cultural activities, including a film screening, spoken word night and candlelight vigil to remember Malcolm X and Yuri Kochiyama, a Japanese-American human rights activist and a member of Malcolm X’s Organization of Afro-American Unity.</p>\n<p>“Tuesday [May 19] is actually the birthday of Malcolm X so we will be holding an event commemorating his birthday as well Yuri Kochiyama’s, with a candlelight vigil to honor them,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>A.S President Ali Guthy also presented the President’s Agenda and said the Academic Affairs Board budget has been cut due to its recent merge with the Office of the Internal Vice President.</p>\n<p>In assessing the allocation of funds for Queer People of Color Conference and Active Minds, A.S. Finance and Business Committee advisor Cindy Lopez reminded senators the OSL budget is at $0 and that senate unallocated fees should be kept primarily for A.S. expenses.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62849\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/a-s-business-committee-runs-low-on-funds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62849\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/a-s-business-committee-runs-low-on-funds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/a-s-business-committee-runs-low-on-funds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/a-s-business-committee-runs-low-on-funds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/a-s-business-committee-runs-low-on-funds/","id":2806,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2805,2804,2803],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
