She’s going to try to grab every single rebound. It’s all the little things that can help us win a game.”</p>\n<p>During the course of a game, the Bozeman, Montana native spends a good amount of time on the ground, diving for loose balls or standing up after taking one of her many charges.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s natural,” Tilleman said. “[I’m] going to do anything [I] can to contribute to the team and to the game and that means diving for the ball. It means giving everything you have.”</p>\n<p>Tilleman’s propensity to embrace the physicality is especially important on a team that is often undersized. Tilleman, at 6’1”, usually faces a height disadvantage herself, guarding the other team’s tallest and most physical player.</p>\n<p>“I enjoy it,” Tilleman said. “I think I might not be the most athletic or the strongest person on the court, but I try to use my body well.”</p>\n<p>The idea that rebounding and defense are not entirely based on size and strength is apparent in Tilleman’s game, and echoed by her head coach.</p>\n<p>“Some of it is will, but she also knows how to use her body,” Mitchell said. “A lot of times, people don’t understand positioning or angles and it’s obvious she understands. That’s why she can guard 6’4’’ [players] and tip a lot of the balls away.”</p>\n<p>As a result, Tilleman is second best on the team in steals, averaging 1.1 a game.</p>\n<p>“Naturally for me on the court, I want to play defense,” Tilleman said. “I take a lot of pride in not letting a player I’m guarding score, but also in helping out my teammates.”</p>\n<p>But what really sets Tilleman apart is her rebounding. She leads her team and ranks third in the Big West in rebounding overall at 8.1 per game.</p>\n<p>“I always think rebounding is one of the most important aspects of the game because it gets you possessions and it keeps possessions from the other team,” Tilleman said. “It’s really demoralizing when you play defense for 30 seconds and you get a great stop, but you don’t secure the rebound because none of that matters. They get another shot at the basket.”</p>\n<p>In conference, she is number two in offensive rebounds (3.2) and sixth in defensive rebounds (4.6).</p>\n<p>“I think it comes down to anticipating where the ball is going, but also blocking out,” Tilleman said. “You learn it from day one when you begin basketball … but I’m not 6’4’’, so [I] have to do those little things … and maybe bang around a few people.”</p>\n<p>The numbers are consistent, too. She maintains her defensive intensity and hits the glass night in and night out.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, you know you’re going to get your six to eight points and 10 or 12 rebounds,” Mitchell said. “As a coach, that makes you feel real confident and probably as a teammate you’d feel good about knowing that, taking that shot, she’ll be there for the rebound.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell has awarded Tilleman for her strong play. She plays 30.1 minutes per contest, the second most on the team.</p>\n<p>“I think she’s always been used to being backed up against the wall or maybe been told that because of her size, she couldn’t do this or do that,” Mitchell said. “So I think she’s always had that edge about her, trying to always prove herself and that’s how she plays.”</p>\n<p>One of the things that struck me most about Tilleman though, was her passion. She loves the game, and it shines through on the floor.</p>\n<p>“I always see [basketball] as a chance for me to go out there and let everything else going on in my life just go and have fun and enjoy that connection I have with my teammates,” Tilleman said. “I like working hard and I like the satisfaction at the end of the game knowing that [I] gave everything.”</p>\n<p>When asked about her goals moving forward, Tilleman didn’t focus on anything too individualistic, but talked about what she could do for the program.</p>\n<p>“I want to be able to help bring this team together, to lift us up,” Tilleman said. “It’s not been the ideal season, but we still have a lot of it left and what it really boils down to is that we’re all still fighting for — that tournament at the end of the year. That’s what matters.”</p>\n<p>There’s certainly nothing selfish about that.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44422\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/ucsbs-bluecollar-baller/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44422\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/ucsbs-bluecollar-baller/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/ucsbs-bluecollar-baller/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/ucsbs-bluecollar-baller/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/ucsbs-bluecollar-baller/","id":776,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[775,774,773],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Hosts Cal Poly in Need of a Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team is in desperate need of a victory after three straight losses, and a win against rival Cal Poly Saturday afternoon might be the perfect remedy.

The 6’2’’ redshirt senior ranks fifth in the nation in points (23.3 per game), 10th in field goal percentage (56.1 percent), and 23rd in rebounds (10.2 per game).</p>\n<p>“She’s going to get her points, but we have to keep her from getting easy baskets and pressure her defensively,” Adrian said. “[Then] we need to box her out and not let her get any easy second chance points.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Kirsten Tilleman will have the responsibility of guarding Santiago and had success in their last matchup, holding Santiago below her average.</p>\n<p>In fact, in their first meeting of the season on Jan. 31 in which UCSB lost 61-58, it wasn’t Santiago that ultimately killed the Gauchos. Instead, it was senior guard Ashlee Burns, who converted a three-point play with 2.3 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“They were running an out-of-bounds play and we were hoping to get a stop so that we could get the last shot or go into overtime,” Adrian said. “Someone got hit on a screen and [Burns] went to the basket and made the layup. It was pretty tough to see that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB did own a lead coming out of halftime, but allowed an 11-2 run by the Mustangs. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig led the Gauchos offensively with 16 points.</p>\n<p>“We continue to say [we need] consistency and a sense of urgency,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We understand that we can’t wait until the last five minutes to come back.”</p>\n<p>Expect an offensive versus defensive battle because the two teams’ styles are on completely opposite ends of the spectrum. Cal Poly loves to score, leading the Big West in scoring with 72.3 points per game and three-point field goal percentage at 33.5 percent.</p>\n<p>UCSB, on the other hand, depends on their defense. They have set the bar for best scoring defense, allowing just 50.8 points per game and holding teams to 37 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been holding teams to really low scoring games and we know that if our defense is there, it’ll be a close game,” Adrian said.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit continues to lead the team in scoring with 9.3 points per contest. Usually the spark off the bench, Nesbit received the nod to start against USC and is expected to start again. Coach Mitchell hopes that Nesbit will aid in pushing the Gauchos out of their shooting funk.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s become a mental thing,” Mitchell said. “Those shots will fall.</p>\n<p>While Adrian agreed, she was quick to add, “We’ll be good against Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>Now there’s the true spirit of rivalry.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.

One of those games is an ESPN Bracket Buster game at Utah State (12-10, 4-3 WAC) on Feb. 18.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, UCSB started off the road trip with a convincing 86-59 win over UC Davis on Thursday. Two days later, a game at Pacific went down to the wire. With 29 seconds left in the game, sophomore guard Kyle Boswell hit a three-pointer to put Santa Barbara up by one at 52-51. The Tigers took the lead back with two free throws, but a foul by Pacific and clutch free throws from senior guard Orlando Johnson with 14 seconds left eventually iced the game for the Gauchos 54-53.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great way to start off our trip and a stretch where we have [seven of eight] on the road,” Williams said. “This will be the most crucial part of our season, and we are focused on taking care of business.”</p>\n<p>This year’s Gaucho squad may be one of the deepest teams in recent memory for Coach Williams. All 11 players — including three freshman — have started at least one game for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We are still searching for the right combination … how we want to play,” Coach Williams said of his rotating lineups. “We think the big lineup has been very productive and has allowed us to do things defensively.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44267\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-03/ucsb-continues-road-trip-faces-fullerton-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44267\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-03/ucsb-continues-road-trip-faces-fullerton-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-03/ucsb-continues-road-trip-faces-fullerton-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-03/ucsb-continues-road-trip-faces-fullerton-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-03/ucsb-continues-road-trip-faces-fullerton-saturday/","id":774,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[773,772,771],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cal Poly Defeats UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There’s a saying that goes “if something’s not working, change it.” But even that didn’t work for the UCSB women’s basketball team, which lost 67-52 Saturday afternoon to Cal Poly.

It’s their responsibility to make sure we’re sharp.”</p>\n<p>Initially, it looked like it might work. UCSB took a 4-0 lead, but it would be the last lead they would see. A pair of unanswered 7-0 runs by Cal Poly left the Gauchos in a familiar hole and they trailed 30-15 at the break.</p>\n<p>A big issue for the Gauchos during the first half was the three-point shooting of Cal Poly, who shot 50 percent from downtown in the first period.</p>\n<p>“We were getting beat off dribble penetration, so at the end of the day, the one-on-one defense wasn’t there,” Mitchell said. “So every time you have to help, then they would kick it to a shooter.”</p>\n<p>At halftime, red-shirt senior Kristina Santiago had just four points, although she was in foul trouble early. However, she exploded in the second half, finishing with 16 and leading all scorers.</p>\n<p>“She’s a really smart player, she’s strong and she has a good shot,” freshman forward Jackie Luna-Castro said, who took on the brunt of guarding Santiago. “At times it was hard because if you get bad positioning, it’s hard for her not to score.”</p>\n<p>UCSB upped their game in the second half and played the Mustangs even on the scoreboard. They even outshot the Mustangs, but never got the score within single digits.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos tried to extend the game by fouling, but Cal Poly hit their free throws down the stretch. Sophomore guard Jonae Ervin was 9-10 from the line in the final two minutes.</p>\n<p>“You look at the stats here and at the end of the day, the free throw line tells the story of the game,” Mitchell said. “They made 18 free throws and we made four.”</p>\n<p>Turnovers aren’t usually an issue for UCSB, which gave the ball away 15 times.
