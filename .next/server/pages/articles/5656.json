We cannot let this go unnoticed. We are privileged to live in a country that allows us to voice our opinions in public and gives us access to unbiased news sources.

Thanks to this humanitarian organization, I was able to participate in the raw, unglorified experience of providing health care by volunteering as a dental assistant in Bisira, Panama. Upon arrival at the Floating Doctors base, our group of nearly 40 volunteers from UCSB teamed up with an international crew of health care providers, including medical doctors, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and one dentist, to prepare the equipment needed for the upcoming multi-day clinic.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89434\" style=\"width: 454px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89434\" data-attachment-id=\"89434\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-02/floating-doctors-sunk-all-doubts/screen-shot-2019-07-29-at-7-51-22-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?fit=2048%2C1361&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1361\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-07-29 at 7.51.22 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89434\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?resize=444%2C295\" alt=\"\" width=\"444\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-7.51.22-PM.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-89434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During our week-long stay, we slept inside a dilapidated shack with no running water or electricity (in comparison to the amenities provided by similar organizations, such as hotel rooms). We bathed in the river each day after taking down our mobile clinic and shared one toilet amongst our large crew. The most humbling part of my week abroad was witnessing Dr. Richard Potter, the sole dentist on our expedition, serve the entire community day after day. With the most bare-bones instruments available, he tirelessly treated each patient from morning until night, in only two days performing over 60 tooth extractions. In terms of hands-on work, we were able to educate the local school children on proper oral hygiene via song and dance, apply fluoride to children’s teeth, create patient charts, bring and sterilize instruments for Dr. Potter and provide lighting with our phones, and handle all other responsibilities apart from performing actual dental treatments. Being able to help those in an area lacking access to proper dental care convinced me that my desire to become a dentist was real. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So for any anxious students out there currently struggling with whether going into health care is right for them, I wholly recommend volunteering with Floating Doctors. There is no better way to know for sure if becoming a doctor, dentist, nurse or other healthcare provider is right for you than by forcing yourself out of your comfort zone, getting your hands dirty and acquiring real-world experience in the field of your dreams. Floating Doctors is the best organization for the uncertain pre-med to apply to because it provides an unpolished, realistic, and gritty volunteering experience abroad. I only wish that I had known about the organization sooner.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89436\" style=\"width: 507px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89436\" data-attachment-id=\"89436\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-02/floating-doctors-sunk-all-doubts/screen-shot-2019-07-29-at-8-04-58-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?fit=1762%2C1260&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1762,1260\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-07-29 at 8.04.58 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?fit=888%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-89436\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?resize=497%2C355\" alt=\"\" width=\"497\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?w=1762&amp;ssl=1 1762w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-29-at-8.04.58-PM.png?resize=1024%2C732&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-89436\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alex Garcia / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siavash Ghadiri believes being a dentist is the most gangster job out there. </span></i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Since the storm, the island has been struggling to return electricity to people’s homes, provide clean water and rebuild damaged infrastructure. As many mainlanders have heard, basic needs are still not being met. Last time I spoke to my abuelo, he said islanders living in remote areas still don’t have access to clean drinking water since the storm. After the hurricane, my family on the mainland had to wait six months to hear from our relatives on the island. When we finally heard back from my abuelo, he told us that the family farm (which my Puerto Rican family relies on for food and income) was destroyed and that all the animals were gone. He showed little worry despite the destruction, even calling himself a “lucky one” for surviving the storm with his brother, sister, nephew and three-year-old granddaughter by his side. Unfortunately, many others on the island have not been so lucky.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The perception of Puerto Rico’s crisis has only been worsened by Trump’s tweets and numerical claims in regards to the hurricane and debt.

In reality, $92 billion dollars is the estimated cost for what the island would need to be fully restored. Even so, </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-says-puerto-rico-got-92-billion-they-n1031276\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congress cut that number in half,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> declaring in courts that the Puerto Rican government will receive $42.5 billion in aid. However, almost three years have passed and only $14 billion has been received, which many people have accused </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of mismanaging.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mismanagement, and one of the most tragic public spending cuts the island has ever seen, was the permanent shutdown of one quarter of Puerto Rico’s public schools</span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/15/17455746/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-schools-closing\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last June</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This decision was made by Julia Keleher, the Secretary of Education appointed by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In total, 254 schools have been closed indefinitely, which has displaced 60,000 K-12 students. Moreover, many of the school closures have affected remote areas where local communities rely heavily on public schools to unify children, parents and teachers to foster a constructive upbringing for disadvantaged children. Keleher stood by her decision, </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/15/17455746/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-schools-closing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claiming</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “We saw in the redesign as a unique opportunity to improve the system in an inclusive, respectful and sensitive way.” </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-puerto-rico-bankruptcy-20170505-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Facebook comment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in response sums up the community’s feelings about school shutdowns: “No to the closing of schools. If they want to save money, then reduce the salary for themselves and stop playing with the children’s education.” What’s worse is that the school closures have disproportionately affected children living in low-income communities who were hit hardest by the hurricane. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No to the closing of schools. If they want to save money, then reduce the salary for themselves and stop playing with the children’s education.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At any rate, there are many complex issues to be dealt with on the island. At times, it’s difficult to imagine transformative change, especially considering the government’s overwhelming debt. However, after the resignation of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> optimism is at an all-time high. The win of the people sparked massive celebration. I even saw my own father become emotional with relief when he heard the news. He expressed his feelings to me over FaceTime, tearing up: “I’m so happy we got to see this in our shared lifetime. Through everything Puerto Ricans have been through, peaceful protest is able to bring change. It can happen!” I realized my dad was right. These protests were not about reacting to a scandal; they were truly a lesson. They were proof that civic action can foster real change.

My favorite part of the process was being reminded of how kind the human spirit can be. As I struggled with buying bus tickets, asking for a meal for takeout  or simply making conversation, I was humbled by the patience, kindness and acceptance of all the Costa Ricans, commonly referred to as Ticos. It seemed that all of the locals were happy that we were trying to get to know their culture by speaking their language and would go the extra mile to help us understand something or learn a new phrase. These moments of connection with strangers and new friends in a different language were truly some of the most beautiful and humbling experiences of my life.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I have to acknowledge the double standard that exists when non-Europeans come to the United States.

My interest in learning another language versus their obligation is the autocratic reality that we live in and must be acknowledged in order for there to be any change. One way to lessen the divide between those of us lucky enough to be born speaking English and those who may never have the opportunity to learn English is to introduce bilingual education in public schools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a simple solution, one that is already occurring in </span><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/13/learning-a-foreign-language-a-must-in-europe-not-so-in-america/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">much of the world</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  I’m not talking about the shitty language requirements implemented in U.S. public schools today.

The United States prides itself on its infrastructure, military, strong international relations and other accomplishments, yet we can’t effectively teach our students another language. In the globalized world that we live in, it is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">necessity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn other languages. We must start the conversation about why the United States is one of the few nations that doesn’t require a bilingual education in schools. We must ask ourselves why we expect everybody else to learn English but fail to make an effort to learn anybody else’s language. With a rapidly growing global market and millions of immigrants moving and settling in the U.S., we must prioritize bilingual education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On my flight to Costa Rica, I was consumed with anxiety about how I would communicate in a language I hardly knew. I was oblivious to how much else there was to learn beyond the dialect. The warmth with which I was embraced by the Ticos and Costa Rican culture helped me regain my faith in humanity. As I connected with the locals, I also became aware of the double standards involving my own privilege, giving me a newfound passion to bring about reform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if learning a language still doesn’t sound interesting, you don’t have the time or you tried unsuccessfully to learn it in school, there are other ways you can help create a world that promotes acceptance, tolerance and advocacy. My message is to be kind and helpful to everyone, especially to those who come from another country and are trying to assimilate to a new culture. You’ll never be able to fully understand what someone else is going through, but recognizing your own privilege and being able to choose what to do with that responsibility is the first step toward a more just world. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carley Weiler believes learning another language is the best way to get to know another culture and to understand what a privilege it is to be a native English speaker. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/why-you-should-learn-another-language/","id":5655,"author":{"id":800,"name":"Carley Weiler"},"related":[5654,5653,5652],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
