Additionally, Patel and Gallegos also attributed their respective resignations to an inabil- ity to balance senatorial duties with other responsi- bilities.</p>\n<p>In a debate about meeting length, Kennedy claimed lengthy meetings were an impor- tant factor in the overwhelming number of resignations.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already had one third of the Senate quit for this reason,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>Senator Ben Green, who does not plan to quit Senate, noted the weight of their responsibilities, taking the absence of Senate members at the meeting as a sign that the senators were being worked too hard.</p>\n<p>“I see a lot of empty seats and that’s indicative of the stress the Senate puts on us,” Green said.</p>\n<p>Segovia announced during that same meeting that she had met with A.S. mem- bers from other UC campuses and had been surprised to learn that none of them had dealt with resignations.</p>\n<p>While last week’s bill to cut off meet- ings at 9:45 p.m. did not pass, Senators did resolve to brainstorm ways to make meet- ings more efficient and thus less stressful. Nevertheless, the four resigned former- senators were not persuaded to remain.</p>\n<p>In light of last night’s resignations, Off- Campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson</p>\n<p>delivered an emotional address stating her personal frustration toward the situation.</p>\n<p>“This is killing me. This is ridiculous,” Christianson said. “I think everyone in this room can tell how much it’s affecting us.”</p>\n<p>Christianson continued to argue that meetings were in fact getting shorter as everyone had begun to become acclimated to their positions.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting better at it. Our 4:00 a.m. meetings were the first few meetings of the year,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>She then called for more honesty between senators and implored them to remember their duties to the student body.</p>\n<p>“More than anything, I want us all to be honest with each other. Please be hon- est with the Senate,” Christianson said. “Remember why you ran for this. Why are you here? It’s a big friggin’ deal … You have so much more power than people who want to make a difference … We have to be that outlet when people have grievances.”</p>\n<p>The new resignations leave several open seats in the Senate. If the people who received the second-highest number of votes in last spring’s elections do not choose to fill those spots, the Internal Vice President will be forced to begin a new application process.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 17th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/","id":3106,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3105,3104,3103],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard","biography":"Not available","articles":[3010,3012,3020,3021,3027,3029,3038,3040,3043,3050,3058,3060,3061,3071,3072,3074,3076,3078,3079,3081,3085,3087,3089,3092,3098,3102,3104,3106,3107,3108,3109,3111,3112,3113,3115,3116,3117,6138],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Students can then use these lists to find contact information for books they need.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Sophia Armen said the student-run textbook marketplace is a kickoff for what the A.S. Office of the President hopes will eventually become an institutionalized series of regular student-run buy-back events at the beginning of each quarter.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a process, but still, it’s something we’re going to start now,” Armen said. “Buying books is expensive, and we have no control over return for books. There’s pressure with costs everywhere, so this way students can make profits instead of having to go through a middleman or to the university.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board are also engineering a student-run textbook website structured similarly to the textbook advertising hosted on many Facebook group pages.</p>\n<p>“We’re tying to make a mechanism that is like Facebook, but student-run,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>UCen Bookstore employee and third-year biopsychology major Debbie Gee said the marketplace threatens to redirect students and revenue away from the campus’s main textbook retailer.</p>\n<p>“It might detract from the amount of traffic in the UCen,” Gee said. “When people buy textbooks they also buy other things, like pens, pencils and notebooks. So if they buy from somewhere else, sales in general could potentially go down, too.”</p>\n<p>According to Armen, the book buy-back will allow students to bypass bookstores and exchange reading material in a much more efficient manner.</p>\n<p>“The problem is, when we consistently go to the university or small companies, books can get expensive because you don’t have other options,” Armen said. “This came out of student organization. We’re creating innovative ideas when the university is putting a burden on our backs.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Elizabeth Dang said the traditional process of buying and reselling schoolbooks is time-consuming and expensive.</p>\n<p>“When I sought out the buying back process, I would find that buyback prices would be for only 20 percent of the book, which is practically nothing,” Dang said. “And textbook costs are ridiculous — especially since we only use it nine weeks, and in most of my classes we only read two chapters out of like 500 pages.”</p>\n<p>While the bookstore does offer the option to rent books for a cheaper price, Gee said a successful student-run textbook marketplace could end up being a worthy competitor to the university.</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure how the prices at this thing will compare to bookstore prices, but lots of students are struggling with finances, and this could detract from sales if it ends up being cheap, efficient and well-run,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>According to Armen, Associated Students Office of the President and Academic Affairs Board hope the textbook marketplace fuels widespread questioning and analysis regarding the causes of high textbook prices and promotes further student organization to address shared financial issues.</p>\n<p>“That’s why we’re here: inspiring students, making [them a] part of the solution on campus and showing the impact of having things student-run,” Armen said. “We are a community sharing resources.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of January 9th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49734\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49734\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/a-s-to-hold-student-run-textbook-marketplace/","id":3103,"author":{"id":158,"name":"Carissa Quiambao"},"related":[3102,3101,3100],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

He added that the resignations of eightsenators during Fall quarter were likely due to the extensive length of meetings, which end anytime between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. with last night’s meeting coming to a close at 9 p.m.</p>\n<p>“We figured we needed to change the culture of the Senate,” Kennedy said, referring to himself and Harrison. “I don’t think this bill is an end-all but I think it’s a really good start.”</p>\n<p>Despite the support of several senators, the bill faced adamant opposition from executive officers and some Public Forum speakers. A.S. President Sophia Armen voiced con- cerns about A.S. members’ dedication and accountability, stating that Senate should not be treated as an easy job and senators should willingly listen to the input of all public forum speakers.</p>\n<p>“This job is hard. You should have all known that going in,” Armen said. “In my opinion, the most people we should be listening to are the people who walk in here … If any of you are resigning because of this — that is unacceptable…The reality is, it’s not about enjoying.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Mayra Segoviap said in her past meetings with A.S. organizations of other schools, there were noticeably fewer resignations.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, on-campus senator Kevin Rudolph voiced his support by claiming that other schools had similar time limits, adding that long meetings cause him to question his own dedication to the group.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, to come here, I love what I’m doing but this meeting is most of the time a burden and it’s very unproduc- tive,” Rudolph said. “I know that other schools have time limits or things like that. I would like to see this [bill] passed.”</p>\n<p>In response to such claims, Armen said students should maintain better focus or initiate more efficient practices in meetings instead of simply slashing meeting times.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that half of the discussion going on in this room isn’t even the projects,” Armen said. “Instead of having 25 minutes of discussion on productivity, why not actually be productive?”</p>\n<p>Adeel Lakhani, who acts as the Commissioner of Academic Affairs in the A.S. Office of the President, rec- ognized the importance of reducing stress for senators but agreed that longer meetings can be necessary to ensure that all business is finished.</p>\n<p>“I do recognize that there is a need to retain senators and make the job easier,” Lakhani said. “But sometimes a four- and-a-half hour meeting isn’t long enough for Senate business … Your meetings take time and your discussions are tough because that’s the nature of what comes to you.”</p>\n<p>Senators resolved to table — essentially postpone — the bill indefinitely. However, there was agreement that A.S. members would spend time at future meetings brainstorming and discussing new methods of increasing productivity and decreasing meeting length.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 10, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49262\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49262\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/","id":3104,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3103,3102,3101],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

According to Choate, there are currently a total of 26 lights with bulbs needing replacement and eight areas identified as insufficiently lit, including portions of Camino Corto, Estero Road and Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>According to Choate, the primary task the project involves is documenting and reporting the numerous missing or obstructed lights to Southern California Edison, which is then obligated to file working orders to have these lights fixed. The group eventually hopes to make this assessment an official duty of the EVPLA Office or hold periodical ‘lighting walks’ to monitor the situation and keep SCE accountable for repairs, Choate said.</p>\n<p>Choate said there is no statistical data showing that lack of lighting leads to more crime in certain areas, but based on the information the group has collected the possibility of a link seems likely.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to see if there is a correlation between crimes that have occurred in certain areas and the lack of lighting in I.V.,” Choate said. “I actually was one of the people who walked the streets and took down all this information as to which lights are out, and from what I’ve heard and what I’ve seen from the emergency alerts, there’s a pretty good chance there will be a correlation.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation and Parks Department Board of Directors member Sawyeh Maghsoodloo said the lack of lighting is a serious detriment to the safety of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“When it’s dark, it’s easier to get away with crime. Studies have shown that in more well-lit areas, crime rates do go down, especially in regard to sexual assault,” Maghsoodloo said. “These are problems we do have in I.V. Undeniably, we do have lighting issues — a lot of the lights haven’t been replaced in who knows how long. Replacing them is one easy step we can take to not only increase safety but to also make residents feel safer, which I think is also important.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD is working extensively with the group to find ways to implement additional lighting.</p>\n<p>According to EVPLA Rhandy Siordia, the project has also prompted Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor Doreen Farr to compose a letter addressing the problem, which will likely be signed by A.S. members.</p>\n<p>“The county is being supportive and willing to sign a letter to send to SoCal Edison, and they’ve become a very enthusiastic partner in this project,” Siordia said. “I really, really am pleased to see that because you don’t see areas like Montecito that have dim lighting areas, where [the] population isn’t as transitional as our college community.”</p>\n<p>The group is looking into raising funds that will finance solar lighting or new transformers to install in particularly problematic areas, Siordia said.</p>\n<p>“Estero Road has no lights at all. That’s very sad that there are community members on that street who for whatever reason do not have any lights there, and it’s dangerous,” Siordia said. “It’s a basic need that we realistically shouldn’t have to be fighting this hard for, but we’re going to fight hard for it nonetheless.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-16/lack-proper-lighting-iv/","id":3105,"author":{"id":205,"name":"Patrick Kulp"},"related":[3104,3103,3102],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
