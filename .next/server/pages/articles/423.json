When I watched him in AAU he played against the best guards in the country,” Coach Williams said. “He gets it up, gets it to the right guy, plays physical. I think he’s going to be a very solid D-I player.”</p>\n<p>Last year the Gauchos had a rotation of three point guards, often playing two for durations of games. Coach Williams plans to experiment with four point guards in the upcoming season, with sophomore Eric Childress and junior T.J. Taylor competing for the starting position again. Taylor needs to improve defensively to rank ahead of Childress, however.</p>\n<p>Added to the mix will be junior guard DaJuan Smith, who might transition from shooting guard to the one, and who provides a better rebounding presence and gets to the rim more. Troutt will most likely backup the trio if not redshirted.</p>\n<p>Jarriesse Blackmon, Utah’s Player of the Year, is Santa Barbara’s next recruit. The 6’6”, 210 lb. combo forward from Layton High School is a player that brings tenacity when it comes to rebounding and length his wingspan is almost seven feet.</p>\n<p>He led his team to the state championship tournament and averaged 16.7 points, 10.7 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 2.0 blocks and 2.0 steals per game his junior year.</p>\n<p>Blackmon also has potential to come in and have an impact, but with All-Big West First Team selection, junior Michael Bryson, and junior John Green ahead of him, Blackmon sits in a similar predicament as Troutt.</p>\n<p>“Our thing is to evaluate whether or not [Troutt and Blackmon are] in the top eight or nine, or is it better off to redshirt them,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Like last year’s recruiting class, Troutt and Blackmon will most likely get their big shot in their second season. In fact, of the three scholarship players from last year’s class, only freshman guard Gabe Vincent earned a spot on the roster while forward Ami Lakoju and guard/forward Justin Burks redshirted.</p>\n<p>Lakoju collapsed during practice before UCSB’s game against Oregon in December. The Gauchos shut him down for the season. Coach Williams is pleased with his progress, noting Lakoju is in better shape and his time off helped him improve his shot.</p>\n<p>Lakoju at 6’8”, 265 lbs. was seen as the natural successor of UCSB’s star big man, senior Alan “Big Al” Williams. Although not expected to fill up the stat sheet anywhere close as Big Al, Lakoju needs to rebound and defend to make a significant impact on the team.</p>\n<p>Burks is another versatile scorer that was forced to sit out. At 6’6” he’s a wing player that can knock down the three-point shot and drive to the basket.</p>\n<p>“We need Ami and [Burks] to fit into the rotation because when we graduate six next year you don’t want to have one player coming back,” Coach Williams said. “You want four coming back.”</p>\n<p>Although only losing two players, the shoes will be huge to fill. Harmon, a two-year starter, quickly gelled with the team after transferring from Ventura Community College. While with the Gauchos he earned a spot on the All-Big West team as an Honorable Mention.</p>\n<p>Also saying farewell is Big Al. Big Al dominated the Big West conference his last two seasons, earning national recognition and a Big West Player of the Year honor his junior year.</p>\n<p>During his last season, he eclipsed Eric McArthur’s mark for most rebounds in programs history. He finished his collegiate career with 1,125 rebounds, 216 blocks (second all-time in program history) and 1,732 points (third all-time).</p>\n<p>This season he averaged 17.3 points per game and 11.8 rebounds per game en route to his third selection on the First Team All-Big West team. Santa Barbara’s offense will change without Big Al; the game will open up considering there won’t be a constant need to feed him the ball on possessions.</p>\n<p>“We’ll be all right. We went 5-2 without [Big Al] last year,” Coach Williams said. “That bodes pretty well for what this team should be able to do next year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Riding a season-high three-game conference win streak, the Gauchos face a Hawaii team that nearly defeated them at the Thunderdome the last time these two played.</p>\n<p>“They’re the most athletic team in the league,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They turn you over, they scramble the game up.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has managed only three road wins on the year. However, they have all come at the expense of league opponents. Coming off wins against the top two teams in the Big West in UC Davis and UC Irvine, Santa Barbara’s mark currently stands at 9-5 in conference and 16-12 overall. The team is one game behind UCI for second place in league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’re starting to roll a little bit on teams, and it’s just good for chemistry going forward,” junior forward Mitch Brewe said. “In a little over a week we have the Big West Tournament, so it’s good to get some momentum going into these upcoming weeks.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii, a team that battled early season adversity with the firing of its head coach and withdrawal of Preseason Big West First-Team forward Isaac Fotu, stands at 7-7 in conference and 19-11 overall. UH is locked in a tie for fifth place with UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara defeated the Rainbow Warriors earlier on the season 75-74 in a game Hawaii would like to have back. In that contest, the Gauchos trailed by as many as 13 points in the second half, but used the three-ball to claw their way back and take the lead.</p>\n<p>UH thought the game was headed to overtime after freshman guard Isaac Fleming knocked down a game-tying three with one second left. However, referees concluded after looking at instant replay that Fleming had his foot on the line, leaving the Rainbow Warriors with a one-point loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s leading scorer, senior center Alan “Big Al” Williams, missed out on the previous encounter since he was still recovering from a shoulder injury. Since his return, he has played like his usual self, recording double-doubles in three of his last four games. At 11.7 rebounds per game, Big Al leads the league in rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Big Al is a large man, and he has an incredible knack for getting the ball,” Brewe said. “The way he sheds defenders and sheds other guys on the court to get the rebounds is incredible.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have had their struggles on the road, the Rainbow Warriors have lost only two conference games at home. UCSB will also have to go up against the added intensity Hawaii will bring, given tonight’s game will be Senior Night for UH.</p>\n<p>This will be the final road game for Santa Barbara before it closes out the season at home against rival Cal Poly Saturday. With the Big West Tournament next week, the Gauchos take aim at finishing with momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much of seeding, every team in this league is good. Getting a lower seed might just be a sleeper game just like it was last year,” freshman guard Gabe Vincent said. “But it’s definitely just playing, seeing how well we execute and getting ourselves ready for what’s next.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is set for 9 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61565\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/mens-basketball-closes-out-road-schedule-in-manoa/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61565\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/mens-basketball-closes-out-road-schedule-in-manoa/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/mens-basketball-closes-out-road-schedule-in-manoa/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/mens-basketball-closes-out-road-schedule-in-manoa/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/mens-basketball-closes-out-road-schedule-in-manoa/","id":420,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[419,418,417],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Close Season Out With Pair of Losses","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB finishes the year out with two losses as it fails to qualify for the Big West Tournament","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61751\" style=\"width: 341px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015.03.05-StephenManga-WBBall-12-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2028905843\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61762\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61751\" data-attachment-id=\"61751\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-09/gauchos-close-season-out-with-pair-of-losses/kristine-brance-soars-past-a-rainbow-warrior-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015.03.05-StephenManga-WBBall-12-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"Stephen Manga\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Kristine Brance soars past a Rainbow Warrior.

That chance was taken away after a 60-36 loss to Hawaii on Thursday. The Gauchos then closed their 2014-15 campaign out with an 84-63 loss at Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ends the year with a 2-27 overall, 2-14 Big West record. Hawaii finished the season winning its final 14 games to claim the Big West title with a record of 22-7 overall and 14-2 in conference play. The Mustangs were able to claim a third place finish after their win over the Gauchos, ending the regular season with a 15-13 overall and 10-6 Big West mark.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB entered its final game against Cal Poly knowing that it would only be for pride, the Gauchos played some of their most inspired basketball in the first half. Senior guard Kristine Brance, playing her final game in a UCSB uniform, got things started with a three-pointer on the team’s first possession, setting the tone for what would be a high scoring first stanza.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As a team, the Gauchos shot an impressive 15-25 from the field in the first half for a season-high 41 points. They were able to do this behind their long-range shooting, where they went 7-9 from beyond the arc. Junior guard Dioseline Lopez was hot early, going a perfect 3-3 from distance, while freshman guard Makala Roper went 2-3 herself. Despite the hot shooting though, UCSB still found itself down 48-41 at the half.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s Ariana Elegado answered UCSB at every turn, putting up 19 points of her own on 5-6 on three-pointers in the first half to go along with five assists. The senior guard went on to finish with 24 points on 8-14 from the field.</p>\n<p>Bench production was the theme for the Gauchos on the day, as all three of their double-digit scorers were not starters. Lopez and Roper ended the game with 13 and 11, respectively, while forward Chaya Durr knocked down an efficient 5-6 from the field herself, finishing her freshman campaign with a solid 11 point outing.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, they could not maintain their hot shooting in the second half, going just 8-24 from the field and being outscored 36-22. Once again, a huge difference on the glass which saw UCSB get outrebounded 47-22 for the game proved to be the difference.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Taryn Garza recorded 12 rebounds and was the Mustangs’ second leading scorer with 11 points, giving her the game’s only double-double. UCSB’s sophomore point guard Onome Jemerigbe facilitated the offense throughout the game, finishing with a personal-best nine assists. She had seven in the first half alone.</p>\n<p>In Thursday’s game against Hawaii, UCSB needed a win to keep its slim hopes of postseason play alive. The Gauchos got off to a hot start as a layup by Brance gave them a 20-16 lead with 10:40 remaining in the first half. However, the Rainbow Wahine answered back with a 14-0 run, eventually taking a 30-23 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>A pair of free throws from freshman small forward Taylor Farris capped an 8-0 run by UCSB, pulling her team within a bucket at 30-28, but once again, Hawaii pulled away, going on yet another 14-0 run. The Gauchos managed just 13 points in the second half on 5-23 shooting as they fell 60-36.</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe paced her team with another solid offensive performance, going for a game-high 14 points on 5-6 from the field and 2-2 on threes.

In the doubles A Flight, senior Taylor Chavez Goggin and junior Mathieu Forget flattened UCSD in an 8-2 rout in their first doubles match of the tournament.</p>\n<p>“That win was a good way to start off the tournament,” Chavez Goggin said. Matt and I both went 6-0 [in the tournament] and we were both serving well. It makes doubles so much easier when you’re used to your partner.”</p>\n<p>Senior Evan Jurgensen and freshman Axel Bouillin also won their doubles match for the day with a convincing 8-4 win in the B Flight, but the team of sophomore Max Glenn and junior Alex Johnson wasn’t as fortunate after losing  a 9-8 heartbreaker in the C Flight. UCSB’s only other loss of the day would come in singles play in the G Flight when Vincent Nguyen beat Bouillin in two sets, 7-6 and 6-4.</p>\n<p>In singles play, Forget and Chavez Goggin again led the charge. In his first match in the A Flight, Forget fell behind after losing the first set 4-6 to Erik Elliot, but then came roaring back to take the next two sets, both by a score of 6-2.</p>\n<p>“He just settled down,” Assistant Head Coach Blake Muller said. “The guy had a really good forehand so [Mathieu] just wore him down.”</p>\n<p>Chavez Goggin won his first match, which came against Chapman Chan, in two sets, 6-3 and 6-4, but the real gem on the day came from Jurgensen, who decimated Max Dutreix in a two set (6-2, 6-1) win in the C Flight.</p>\n<p>“He played well and he served well,” Muller said. “The guy struggled with the high forehand and Evan stayed up there.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went on to win all nine of their matches on Saturday without losing a set, including Forget’s 6-0, 6-0 routing of LMU’s Daniel Simko in the A Flight.</p>\n<p>“I had a really good win on the first day and that really boosted my confidence,” Forget said. “I just played solid. I felt really good about myself. I played simple and relaxed.”</p>\n<p>Alex Johnson also managed to stand out on a day when all the Gauchos played outstanding matches. Facing Jack Zapala in the F Flight, Johnson came within two games of replicating Forget’s achievement as he won both of his sets 6-1.</p>\n<p>“I think Alex is still trying to get comfortable a little bit since it’s his first year at UCSB,” Muller said. “But he never let up and he never let the guy believe he had a chance.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara closed the tournament as it had opened it: by winning seven of their nine matches to bring their total up to 23 wins out of 27 possible for the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I think our guys are all playing well,” Muller said. “They’ll come back ready to play after the break. We have a tough start to the schedule. How we play in those first few matches will say a lot.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will not see action again until the regular season starts when they travel to Pepperdine on Jan. 22.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-29859\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/gauchos-win-preseason-tourney/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-29859\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/gauchos-win-preseason-tourney/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/gauchos-win-preseason-tourney/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/gauchos-win-preseason-tourney/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-16/gauchos-win-preseason-tourney/","id":422,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[421,420,419],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
