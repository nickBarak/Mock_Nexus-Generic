To their credit, Long Beach hung around, matching the Gauchos point for point until the score was tied at 29. Then, UCSB’s freshman phenoms took over. First, middle blocker Brandon Hicks slammed down a spike to give Santa Barbara the lead; on the subsequent point, Fredrick spiked an over-hit pass straight down to give the Gauchos the lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But LBSU proved their resilience on Friday, battling back to take the second set 31-29. In large part, junior outside hitter and Team USA player TJ DeFalco dominated the set, spiking six of his 20 total kills. UCSB also made some crucial errors towards the end of the set, with Hicks missing a gamepoint serve and Fredrick committing an attack error that ultimately gave the set to LBSU.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that point, UCSB’s fatigue seemed to set in, with the Gauchos getting hammered in the third set 25-14. After a plethora of mental errors, Santa Barbara fell behind early 11-4 and could never recover. Based in large part on subpar passing, the Gauchos could only get six kills during the entire set; excluding fifth sets, that mark would set a season low for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the intermission between the third and fourth set, the 1400 people in admission did all they could to motivate Santa Barbara, and the Gauchos responded in the fourth set. After a missed served by LBSU, UCSB was up 24-21 in the fourth set, needing just one point to take the top team in the nation to a fifth set for the second straight day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a kill by DeFalco, Long Beach setter Josh Tuaniga proved why he is one of the best players in the nation. Along with his 52 assists on the night, Tuaniga provided four straight aggressive serves that put the Gauchos under pressure. Behind his serving, LBSU went on a 4-0 run, coming all the way back to take the set 26-24 and subsequently winning the match.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All night, Santa Barbara’s unforced errors proved to be their Achilles’ heel; in that fourth set, the Gauchos missed six serves. Against a lesser opponent, UCSB could have used their raw talent to win anyways, but against the defending champions those errors ultimately proved costly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, UCSB has plenty to hang their hat on. The Gauchos were able to give inarguably the best team in the nation a run for their money twice in two days, proving that UCSB can keep up with anyone in the nation. More importantly, a youthful Santa Barbara team was able to get crucial experience against an elite opponent </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something that should help the Gauchos tremendously moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will have next week off, before taking on Cal State Northridge at home on March 29.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Despite my doubts, I would watch Miss Universe every year and see women who looked seemingly perfect. Like many, I wondered if I could be them one day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditionally, beauty pageants revolved around the judgement of physical attributes, but since have evolved to include personality and talent. The talent competition, contestant profile and numerous question and answer portions illustrate this very point. They now strive to be </span><a href=\"https://todayvenezuela.com/2019/01/06/the-miss-universe-pageant-is-more-diverse-than-ever/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more inclusive of all races</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the intent of the Miss Universe pageant being “a way to celebrate women and diversity.” Additionally, the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/12/17/miss-spain-becomes-first-transgender-woman-compete-miss-universe-pageant/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.731737227223\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first transgender contestant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> competed in the Miss Universe 2018 competition. While this may seem like a step in the right direction, the overwhelming public opinion says otherwise, arguing that </span><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-miss-universe-pageant-is-still-sexist-as-hell-and-not-what-we-need-right-now\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beauty pageants are sexist</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because of the burdensome expectations they impose on women to be “gorgeous, intelligent, and poised.” These critics often target the evening gown and swimsuit competition as the basis of their claims, as those parts of the competition are based solely on physical appearance. Miss America has responded to this enduring criticism by</span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miss-america-ending-swimsuit-competition_us_5b167608e4b093ac33a1d36e\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cutting the infamous swimsuit and evening gown competitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, instead aiming to focus on “honoring talent and scholarship.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My view of beauty pageants changed from skepticism to hope after competing in one myself and being positively impacted by the experience.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My view of beauty pageants changed from skepticism to hope after competing in one myself and being positively impacted by the experience. I was mostly piqued by curiosity and wanting to try something new, especially since it’s such a popular tradition in the South. There are many </span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/literally-darling/trying-to-be-pretty-in-a-southern-beauty-pageant-town_b_7623954.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">societal expectations of women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> associated with the notion of “Southern hospitality” that pervade the South; high importance is placed on appearing charming, beautiful, and poised. This is a direct link to the traditional archetype of Southern beauty and femininity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In high school, I did not fit the description of a stereotypical girl who would be interested in competing in beauty pageants. I was focused on my studies, my friends and my involvement in extracurriculars — not winning a beauty competition. My friend group, who were focused on similar things, surprisingly did not question my newfound curiosity. Some even showed up to watch and support me on the night of the pageant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first met girls in rehearsal who had been vying for the crown since they were toddlers, competing in numerous local and regional beauty contests to work their way up. I learned that the acquisition of one crown improved your pageant resume, in a sense, even if our high school competition was open to anyone in our school. Competing in our pageant also served as a valuable opportunity to practice poise, talent, etc. in preparation for later pageants. This, however, increased my skepticism upon entering the competition. Being the inexperienced outsider that I was, and lacking the shared intention to continue competing, I couldn’t help but feel somewhat excluded.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the supportive female community, I discovered that the most positive impact of pageantry was the newfound confidence it gave me. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite both my skepticism and my expectations that all my competitors would have elitist attitudes, I unexpectedly made multiple friends during the process. Rehearsal was grueling and started uncharacteristically early for a two-hour pageant. We would practice the opening number and our exits and entrances </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over and over again</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> until I was sure that the directors in charge were taking the event way too seriously. We would laugh after rehearsal at the ridiculousness of the dance moves we had to memorize and the “walks” we had to perfect before the final day, which made me feel at ease. Although these girls had more experience than I did, they didn’t have the snobby attitudes I expected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the morning of the pageant, the interview (which I didn’t prepare for) was the most telling part of the event. Every girl wore heels and bright dresses, with their makeup and hair already done. I didn’t have as much motivation to wake up early and get all of that done ahead of the 9 a.m. interview, and ended up dressing professionally with minimal makeup. Having done many academic and extracurricular interviews before, I believed I would nail it. However, the questions asked by the judges seemed almost </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> serious, like they were searching for the perfect answer. They asked questions like “how do you handle cliques at school?” with facial expressions that read, “I’m not looking for an answer about real personal experience, but one that’s been rehearsed.” Despite not doing as well as I’d expected, I still had hope for the merit of the pageant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a long day of preparation, the night of the pageant was still nerve-wracking, primarily because most of the girls were worried they would trip on stage or misspeak in front of the audience. When I used to watch the evening gown competition on TV, I imagined girls backstage gawking at each other, internally comparing who looked best in their dress. Instead, we all offered each other words of encouragement and praise before we individually took the stage. When the winners were announced at the end, we were happy for each other and grateful we got to develop friendships during the experience (I know, shocker!). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the supportive female community, I discovered that the most positive impact of pageantry was the newfound confidence it gave me. I didn’t realize until the end, when I found that I wasn’t as nervous onstage as I’d thought I’d be. It wasn’t that I wanted to look better than anyone, but that I felt confident in myself. But this wasn’t even the most rewarding aspect of participating. It was the moment when my mom came up to me afterwards with tears in her eyes, telling me how proud she was. To go on stage alone and walk in front of a crowd of people — many of whom attended my high school — with no prior experience as a beauty queen, was no easy feat. I didn’t care about what the judges or the audience thought of me, only about what I thought of myself, and I felt good.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai wants people to know the positive impacts beauty pageants can have on women.</span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86781\" style=\"width: 297px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86781\" data-attachment-id=\"86781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-09/argument-in-the-office-are-beauty-pageants-feminist-or-flawed/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=1792%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1792,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"beauty pageant kate ryan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?fit=888%2C1015&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86781\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan-219x250.jpeg?resize=287%2C328\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1 219w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=768%2C878&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?resize=896%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 896w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beauty-pageant-kate-ryan.jpeg?w=1792&amp;ssl=1 1792w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kate Ryan / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Beauty Pageants: Only Skin Deep</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Emily Hickingbottom</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our current political and social climate, beauty pageants in the United States have become targets of widespread, controversial criticism. While competing in these competitions may seem innocent enough when girls are young, as years pass, competitions become increasingly focused on unrealistic physical beauty standards that can damage a girl’s self-image and confidence. Instead of teaching girls to strive for career focused and academic success, these competitions perpetuate the idea that “beauty” is a woman’s most important characteristic when determining her overall worth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though certain people (*</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cough cough*</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trump) and recent events in the media might suggest otherwise, generally speaking, I’d like to think that we are living in a time where gender equality is the norm — particularly in the United States (though this isn’t always the reality). But, there is a startling disparity between the focus on male versus female sexuality in entertainment, specifically on television. There is a great deal of attention given to the Miss America Pageant and other pageants like it. These pageants champion a very specific “type” of woman, and, in doing so, they invalidate and demean the majority of other women who don’t meet these requirements. The ideal candidate is many things: She is tall, but not too tall; thin, but not too thin; curvy, but in only the “right” places. Always smiling, always put together, always on cue. Women’s beauty and self-worth extend far beyond these superficial standards of attractiveness. Qualities involving attraction and beauty are not measured by the size of a woman’s waist or by the symmetry of her face. These measurements are shallow and speak volumes when evaluating what the Miss America competition and similar pageants represent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By allowing pageants to determine beauty or value based almost entirely on surface level characteristics, we are projecting harmful images about a woman’s “place” and purporting normative expectations of appearance, thus slowing our advancement into a more progressive society. With ever-changing definitions of femininity and beauty developing in America, competitions like Miss America, and the narrow beauty ideals they promote, are becoming increasingly outdated and are in dire need of greater scrutiny.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These pageants champion a very specific “type” of woman, and, in doing so, they invalidate and demean the majority of other women who don’t meet these requirements.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The danger of beauty pageants is evidenced in the name itself. They evaluate participants based solely upon physical “beauty” and reduce these women’s unique and individually remarkable features to nothing more than a series of numbers on a scale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some might disagree because of the question and answer portions included in some beauty pageants. While I grant that this gives the contestant an opportunity to showcase themselves outside the physical realm, there exists a long-standing expectation of fumbling failure amid this segment of the competition, held by viewers and judges alike. Contestants are called to answer what is typically a controversial, multifaceted question, who are then expected to respond eloquently, despite the pressure and lack of preparation for the question. It almost seems as if judges are waiting for contestants to fail, especially considering the judges’ and media’s reactions to incidents like </span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/miss-utah-usa-2013-fumbles-question_n_3451918\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miss Utah’s fumbled answers </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during her run for Miss USA in 2012.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building further on this point, we must also consider the corporate sponsorships and owners of these supposedly harmless, good-natured competitions. Of course, these large corporations would not want to promote an idea of beauty which gives women — particularly female viewers of the pageant — the idea that intellect and personal values are more important than living up to a rigid set of impossible beauty standards. If us women collectively came to that conclusion, we might not buy as much makeup, or shop as often or regularly allow men to determine our worth. We might argue more to receive equal pay or, worse yet, start speaking up for ourselves in situations where we don’t believe our interests are being equally represented. This is not to say that all businesses and corporations have these intentions, but when we stop to consider who is at the head of some of the major national pageants, it becomes apparent that their respective owners do not actively endorse gender equality, or even respect women, for that matter.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The continued occurrence of these toxic competitions only serves to convince men and women alike that physical beauty is an acceptable measurement of a woman’s worth</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, who owns them? Who has vested interests in the pageant’s success? In the case of Miss America, the owner and individual responsible for their continued success in 2015 was none other than </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/miss-usa-2018-miss-america-tries-rebrand-trump-s-former-ncna876246\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donald Trump.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think it’s safe to say that, given our current political climate and Donald Trump’s infamy in the United States, we are fully aware that his version of respecting women is far from acceptable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, I imagine watching my future daughter up on stage, competing in a Miss California or Miss USA pageant and, immediately, I am overcome with anger. In a time when gender equality and sexual freedom are at a peak in our current society, I would hope that women don’t need validation from a select group of biased judges with predisposed preferences for a narrow set of characteristics, predetermined by heterosexual, white, male owners and sponsors of the competitions. I think the idea that beauty can be defined by physical characteristics is, in and of itself, a toxic concept. If we could define beauty by a specific set of physical characteristics, then we could, theoretically, define what characteristics make an individual unattractive as well. When considering things from the reverse perspective, the thought that we can identify beauty purely based on appearance seems absolutely absurd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The continued occurrence of these toxic competitions only serves to convince men and women alike that physical beauty is an acceptable measurement of a woman’s worth. Generations of young women, including the young women on this campus, are presently growing up in the shadow of a misogynistic president and his anti-feminist ideals. And unfortunately, despite my belief that pageantry might have the capability to change into a valuable experience for young women under the right leadership and reform, the overwhelmingly powerful presence of men like Trump in this arena makes it extremely difficult to separate the positives from the negatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are all beautiful, each of us in our own unique ways, both physically and mentally. No two people are the same and no two people perceive beauty in the same way. So trust me when I tell you, regardless of what pageant judges or Trump might say, every single one of you is gorgeous. Your worth and beauty extends far beyond what any competition can possibly attempt to decide. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Hickingbottom wants women to know that their beauty runs much deeper than the surface. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image_123986672-2.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/joshen-mantai/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Joshen Mantai</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Joshen Mantai serves as the 2020-2021 Director of Social Media Strategy.

a lot to gain but a lot to lose.</p>\n<p>However, it rose to the challenge, and Santa Barbara came up with its 12th-straight win in its final non-conference tilt of the season defeating unranked Lindenwood 3-1 with set scores of 25-16, 25-14, 20-25, 25-20.</p>\n<p>The victory gives the Gauchos its longest win streak since 1980 and they also improve to 15-3 on the year, more specifically 10-1 at home. Lindenwood, who to its credit is one of six teams to take a set from UCSB during its 12-game run, falls to 7-12 on the year and has now lost three-straight contests.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Looking at the stats, however, one would probably not be able to imagine how the Lions were able to win a set.</p>\n<p>For the night, Santa Barbara shot just a mediocre .248 shot percentage but in the first two sets was especially dominant. As a team it also had an impressive eight service aces, three of which came courtesy of Keenan Sanders. It also held Lindenwood to a much worse .68 mark on Friday.</p>\n<p>Freshman Ryan Wilcox again paced the offense for the Gauchos earning a match-high 11 kills. This marks the third time in the last four matches that Wilcox has had double-digit kills.</p>\n<p>In the first set, UCSB took control after the match was tied at 5-5. The Gauchos would go onto five of the next six points to take a 10-6 lead.</p>\n<p>At 14-10, UCSB would finish off the set on an 11-6 run to win 25-16. In the first, it was a very evenly paced match for Santa Barbara. Both Wilcox and junior opposite Fredrick Spencer had four kills with Wilcox also having an ace.</p>\n<p>Spencer had a great night himself earning a double-double with 10 kills and 10 digs. Defensively, freshman Brandon Hicks also played well totaling a team high four blocks to go with nine kills.</p>\n<p>In the second, it was more of Lindenwood’s mistakes that allowed UCSB to coast to another easy win at 25-14. The Lions had nine errors and show -.111 compared to the Gauchos .318 shot percentage.</p>\n<p>The third set saw the roles completely reverse, however, as Lindenwood shot .267 and had a team-high 13 kills on the night. The team jumped out to an 8-4 lead and really never looked back.</p>\n<p>In that set, Junior Connor Hipelius was the leader for of the pack for the Lions tallying four kills.</p>\n<p>The middle blocker led the team with eight kills, six blocks and a .667 hitting percentage while sophomore teammate Michael Jennings also recorded eight kills and added in five digs.</p>\n<p>For the most part, even in the fourth set, Lindenwood played better. After taking a 2-0 deficit to the break, the Lions responded to hold the Gauchos to .111 and .136 attack percentages in the third and fourth sets, respectively.</p>\n<p>However, the fourth set saw Lindenwood have many of the same problems as it did in the second. The Lions had 10 errors in the set and shot -.38 as the Gauchos took the last set pretty easy 25-20.</p>\n<p>Senior outside hitter Corey Chavers, who for the second straight match did not have double-digit kills, finished with nine strikes, five digs and three total blocks. And, for the fourth-straight match, junior setter Casey McGarry had over 30 assists totaling 33, a team high.</p>\n<p>With the win, UCSB got past the opponent it should have beat. Now, it will turn its attention to the toughest team in the country, No. 1 Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>12 straight wins is impressive, especially considering the teams Santa Barbara has beaten along the way, but a 13th straight win would go a long way in helping UCSB show that it is for real.</p>\n<p>The Big West Conference currently houses the four top teams in the country according to ranking. League play is now in full effect so everyone will see who are the pretenders and who are the ones that will compete for a national title.</p>\n<div class=\"rich-v2 modern has-sidebar clearfix\" data-module=\"article-rich\" data-title=\"No. 4 Gauchos Tame Lions to Extend Win Streak to 12\" data-url=\"/sports/m-volley/2018-19/releases/2019030923l61q\">\n<div class=\"article-body clearfix\">\n<div class=\"article-text\">\n<p>UCSB’s next match is at 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 14 at No. 1 Long Beach State.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

come a long way this season and before it has a showdown with the No. 1 team in the nation next week in Long Beach State it must first not lose focus on its opponent this week, unranked Lindenwood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Santa Barbara boasts a 14-3 overall record and, with two wins against UC San Diego, it also has a 2-0 conference record. As it prepares to host Lindenwood, who is 7-11 overall, 3-5  in conference, UCSB also has a 9-1 record at Rob Gym. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their previous outing, the Gauchos were efficient all evening, hitting .400 (37-11-65) as a team while their opponent, UCSD, hit just .162 (23-12-68). Additionally, in that match, freshman outside hitter Ryan Wilcox led the night with 10 kills.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For UCSB, this will be the first time it ever faces off against the Lindenwood program. However, against similar opponents, Lindenwood is 1-8 with its only win coming against Ohio State, a team UCSB lit up and swept. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, no one is really excited to play Santa Barbara right now. On top of being winners of 11 straight, seven of those victories have come against AVCA Top-15 competition. Also, a win on Friday for UCSB would give them its longest win streak since 1980.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, of the 12 Top-15 teams Santa Barbara has faced, it has gone 9-3 in those games. UCSB has the toughest schedule in the nation when looking at its cumulative opposition, currently holding a 252-140 overall record. Down the stretch, the Gauchos also have the toughest schedule in the nation, facing No. 1 LBSU, No. 2 Hawaii and No. 3 UC Irvine ranked teams in its remaining conference play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big part for UCSB success this season has been because of senior outside hitter Corey Chavers. For the season, he leads the team by far with 236 kills (3.75 k/s) and 32 service aces. Additionally, Chavers is also among the team leaders in digs (66) and total blocks (32).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chavers has also accumulated three Big West Player of the Week honors this season and has had three matches with over 20 kills. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another big reason for the Gauchos’ success is the collection of freshmen that continue to thrive as the season continues. The aforementioned Wilcox has been arguably the best of the bunch earning three Big West Freshman Player of the Week honors. There have only been nine handed out this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season, the outside hitter has reach the double-digit kill total six times and in this 11-game stretch, he has averaged just over nine kills a game much better than his 6.4 kills per game during the first six games of the year. He is second on the team in total kills with 132.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for other freshman, Brandon Hicks has also been impressive. He too has earned a Big West Freshman Player of the Week honor and has played well on the defensive end for the Gauchos as the middle blocker leads the team in blocks with 54.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of their competition, the Lions have been having an up and down season. Since starting the year 2-6, Lindenwood has won five of its last 10 to be at a steady record but it still has a lot of work to be done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where the Lions have struggled most this season has been limiting their opponents offensive opportunities. Currently, opponents average a .261 attack percentage and earn 11 kills per set. As a team, UCSB hits .326 for the season and earns nearly 12 kills per set.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lions do have three players with more than 100 kills led by junior opposite hitter Charley Hlavin who has 167. His running mate, Nick Stevenson, is tied for second on the team in kills with 129. Unfortunately, the two combined only shoot a .171 attack percentage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, this weekend is key for the Gauchos in the sense they cannot get ahead of themselves. It would be easy to overlook a team like Lindenwood, a team UCSB could beat easy. But it shouldn’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara has a lot of key matches up ahead, especially next week, but the only one that matters right now is unranked Lindenwood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes on Lindenwood at 7 p.m. on Friday, March 8 at Rob Gym.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
