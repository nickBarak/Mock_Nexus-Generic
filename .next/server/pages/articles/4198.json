The Rainbow Warriors have now lost their last five games.</p>\n<p>This sweep was yet another achievement for the Gauchos as they have now won all five home weekend series, continue their best home start in school history (20-1) and now have swept two conference opponents, a task that is never easy.</p>\n<p>“It’s great to have these opportunities to sweep.” Checketts said. “In baseball in general its hard [to sweep]. We did not play great baseball but the guys hung in there and got a win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to clinch the sweep of Hawaii in style winning Sunday’s game in walk-off fashion that had fans and players out of their seats when they saw the collision at home plate that won the game 5-4.</p>\n<p>Hawaii began the scoring in this ball game as in the first inning senior Jacob Sheldon-Collins hit an RBI single giving his team the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos responded quickly as catcher Grover Dempsey tied the game at one after hitting a fielder’s choice RBI. An RBI triple by sophomore infielder J.J. Muno made the score 2-1 in favor of UCSB after two innings.</p>\n<p>In the fourth inning, the Rainbow Warriors were able to score two runs to retake the lead at 3-2 after a home run by freshman infielder Ethan Lopez and an RBI double by senior Matt LoCoco. Hawaii added one run in the fifth to go up 4-2 after five innings.</p>\n<p>As it had done all season, Santa Barbara fought back and in the sixth inning tied the game up at four after a sac fly by sophomore shortstop Clay Fisher, and an RBI single from Muno.</p>\n<p>The game then got really interesting in the final inning of play. With one out and runners on first and second the Gauchos called upon freshman Noah Davis, who had been struggking with a toe injury, to get them out of this jam.</p>\n<p>He didn’t look so hot at first as after an errant pitch, both runners were able to steal a base and now were in scoring position. Davis then walked the batter making it bases loaded for junior Marcus Doi.</p>\n<p>The freshman broke from his shaky start and pitched it well against Doi, eventually making him hit a grounder that the Gauchos were able to convert into a double play and get them out of the inning unscaved.</p>\n<p>“That double play was big for us.” Checketts said. “Noah [Davis] coming in and making that pitch on his bad toe.”</p>\n<p>The game still tied at four, the Gauchos now had a chance to win it in the bottom half of the final frame. Senior Ryan Clark wasted no time getting on base with a single, then stealing second to get into scoring position.</p>\n<p>After a bunt by redshirt junior Andrew Calica, Clark was now on third base while the Gauchos only had one out so they were in perfect position to win the game.</p>\n<p>Freshman Michael McAdoo had the honors of trying to seal a victory for his team and did just that hitting a fielder’s choice RBI. His hit was a short one that was quickly grabbed by the shortstop who threw it home in hopes of getting Clark out.</p>\n<p>“A backbreaker for them.” Checketts said. “We got a green read at third so we are going on contact and the catcher just missed it. Tough break for them, great break for us.”</p>\n<p>The two players, Clark and freshman catcher Kekai Rios, collided as the senior slid at home base for the win. Rios was unable to handle the ball while also taking a punishing hit and thus the Gauchos won in tremendous walk-off fashion.</p>\n<p>“He was blocking the plate pretty good so I knew I had to go in real hard and luckily he missed the ball.” Clark said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos would only need walk-off win in Sunday’s game as the Saturday’s and Friday’s games were much easier wins for the team.</p>\n<p>UCSB put together a great eighth inning scoring three runs which led to its solid 6-3 victory and made history as it was their 15<sup>th</sup> consecutive home win, a school record that now stands at 16 after Sunday’s win.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked good early scoring two runs in the third inning to take a solid 2-0 lead after three. Hawaii responded as Doi’s RBI double and Lopez’s two RBI single gave the Rainbow Warriors a 3-2 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB tied the game up at three after an error by Hawaii allowed Muno to score the tying run.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the eighth, Dempsey gave his team a 4-3 lead after hitting a solo shot to left field. Muno would then score on a wild pitch and Calica added one final run hitting a sac fly to score teammate Fisher, giving the Gauchos a 6-3 lead.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Trevor Bettancourt shut down Hawaii in the ninth and made sure no comeback was possible and secured the 6-3 victory. The right hander allowed only one hit in three innings of play.</p>\n<p>After the win, the Gauchos were happy to make history and break a record that had stood for so long but were aware that this was not enough.</p>\n<p>“We got a good group of dudes and I’m happy about that.” Clark said. “This is cool but we just have to keep winning no matter where we are.”</p>\n<p>The win was big in a slew of fashion, not just for breaking the school record, but it also marked the first time UCSB had won a series at home against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“They’re a really good team.” Clark said. “No matter the situation, our guys stay cool and find a way to win. I’ve never experienced something like this before.”</p>\n<p>Before achieving two feats on Saturday, the Gauchos beat down the Rainbow Warriors, thanks to sophomore Austin Bush’s performance, 14-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was scoring at a ridiculous pace early on scoring 11 runs in the first five innings of the ball game. Big performances were seen from Bush who’s two run homer in the bottom of the first inning gave his team the 2-1 lead and they never looked back.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the day Bush went 3-5 (.600) with five RBI’s, two runs, and one home run.</p>\n<p>“He was great for us.” Checketts said. “He has a great swing and he made great contact.”</p>\n<p>Despite going 1-4 (.250) on the day, Grover’s one hit was a home run that scored three runs for the Gauchos in the bottom of the fourth frame giving his team a commanding 8-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Pitching wise junior Shane Bieber (8-2) had another solid outing for his team pitching seven innings and surrendering only six hits and one run while striking out seven batters. The righty has now won eight games this season tying his career high.</p>\n<p>“Bieber was really solid game for us once again. He’s a really solid pitcher.” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Overall, this weekend was another great one for the Gauchos. Not only in terms of breaking records but also in the fact that it did not let the sweep by Cal Poly of them a couple of weekends ago change them. This team continues to fight and grow each week and it certainly has been a fun process to witness.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Tuesday, May 3 against Pepperdine at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Naloxone is a medication that temporarily blocks the opioid receptors in the brain and keeps the opioid from being able to attach to those receptors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the training, free Naloxone nasal spray kits were handed out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>About 45 students and community members were present at the first training on Tuesday. The second training will be held on Thursday, April 4 at 7 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The start of the trainings follows a public health announcement sent out by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead on March 20. The announcement said that in the past few weeks, “three Isla Vista residents suffered from an apparent overdose of opioids,” and while two were revived with the use of Naloxone, the third did not survive, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>UCSB’s Director of News and Media Relations Andrea Estrada later clarified to the <em>Nexus </em>that the overdose resulting in death did not occur in I.V. , and the individual was not an I.V.  resident, as had been stated in the announcement sent out to all UCSB students.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The trainings, however, were not held as a result of the most recent overdoses, according to Angie Bryan, the recovery program manager and a recovery specialist for UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program. In fact, planning for the trainings has been in the works for a little over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan first proposed an overdose prevention protocol to Student Health during March 2018, and the standing order was approved by the director of behavioral health in October of 2018, Bryan said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan was approved for a Naloxone grant through the California Department of Public Health’s Naloxone Distribution Project in November 2018, and received a supply of Naloxone in December 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan led Tuesday’s Naloxone training in the I.V. Community Room.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve been a counselor at UCSB for almost 15 years,” Bryan said at the beginning of the training. “Naloxone is something I’m really passionate about in terms of making sure that we get it into as many hands and homes as possible because I think it’s important for students to feel empowered to do something.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Students are the ones that are gonna be there in those first moments that an overdose might happen.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan discussed preventative measures that students could take, such as using fentanyl test strips and various drug testing kits that can test for a range of substances, along with how to reduce the risk of using certain substances.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>She then asked attendees for what they think signs of an overdose are, to which attendees responded with an individual being unresponsive, having pinpoint pupils and having discoloration of the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But even after Naloxone is administered, 911 still needs to be called, Bryan explained.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan demonstrated the use of Naloxone by asking an attendee to volunteer to lie on the ground acting as an individual who overdosed. She then went through the hypothetical motions of using the nasal spray on the volunteer.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bryan said that all law enforcement officers and paramedics in I.V. carry Naloxone, including UCPD and the I.V. Foot Patrol, and emphasized that a person who calls law enforcement in response to an overdose cannot be charged with a misdemeanor crime of possession or being under the influence.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, that is not the case for felony-type charges, Bryan said. For example, if one has an excessive amount of drugs that seems like an intent to sell, law enforcement could investigate that.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jeike Meijer, the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA), collaborated with Bryan on the trainings after Bryan received the Naloxone grant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“We sat down, we had a meeting, we kind of tried to think about when would be the best time to have [the trainings], and we thought before Deltopia was the best,” Meijer said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meijer said preparing students for overdose situations as opposed to just discouraging drug use is a more effective route for keeping students safe.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I think it’s really important to not just say ‘don’t do drugs,’ because people will do it, and it’s good to know how to be safe in the case of an emergency,” Meijer said. “Even if you don’t think that you’ll be using opioids, you might have a neighbor, or a housemate [who does].”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meijer added that the public health announcement sent out to UCSB students which mentioned the recent opioid overdoses reiterates the necessity of Naloxone trainings.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m hoping that conversations and de-stigmatization… will allow people to get the help they need.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Along with Bryan, Meijer also hopes to help with more Naloxone trainings in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Angie had all of the information and all of the knowledge to bring,” Meijer said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“There’s always people working on projects and there’s always someone who’s going to know more than you, and you have to know when to step back and let them take the wheel but give them all of the power you have,” Meijer said. “I don’t know how to do the trainings, but I can give the space.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

</b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself with some free time and extra cash this Saturday, April 27, stop by the Isla Vista Market at Little Acorn Park at 6747 El Embarcadero from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The casual open-air market will host local vendors selling everything from vintage clothing, handmade jewelry and ceramics to biodegradable glitter, stickers and art. There will even be services such as eyebrow threading. Over 30 vendors will be putting their goods on display, with some taking Venmo for payment, too. Isla Vista Trading Post will also have their shop set up and will be allowing patrons to pick out three pieces of clothing for free.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1233084290181051/\"><b>Soundcheck </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some say that the best bands are formed solely by chance. For bands playing at the 2019 Band Lottery Showcase, that’s exactly what happened. About a month ago, Biko Garage Funzone hosted an event where musicians looking to form a group could meet up and be randomly sorted into new bands. Now, some of those bands are returning to Biko Garage at 6612 Sueno Road on Saturday from 7 to 10 p.m. to put their new grooves to the test. At least two of the bands are scheduled to play, and Isla Vistans can drop in throughout the night to support some of the newest local music in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/279842549625140/\"><b>Down with Capitalism </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who ever said communism is dead? Definitely not a couple of bands slated to play at Communist Mothers Music Collective this Saturday, April 17 at 8 p.m. Local bands Careless Cub and Aqua Stalin will be providing the tunes for a night of condemning capitalism among comrades. If you’ve got a bone to pick with the system, this is the party for you. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/319398622107660/\"><b>Yoga for the Soul </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mantra Lounge Kirtan Santa Barbara and Yoga Isla Vista host an evening of Kirtan Yoga for community members to gather, shed the stresses of the day and unwind with meditative music. Kirtan is a type of religious performance art, using storytelling and narrating to take participants through meditation, but participants of all beliefs are encouraged to participate. The yoga sesh charges a $5 fee and comes with a complimentary vegan treat. The class will be held at Yoga Isla Vista at 900 Embarcadero Del Mar, Suite D, upstairs from the parking behind Silvergreens. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.earlwarren.com/sbfair\"><b>Fun at the Fairgrounds </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As summer inches closer, lots of people are looking to break away from hitting the books and start enjoying all the fun that summer has to offer. For those looking to get started early, the Santa Barbara Fair &amp; Expo is coming to town this week. It’s open from 4 to 10 p.m. on Thursday, April 25; from 4 to 12 p.m. on Friday, April 26; from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. on Saturday, April 27; and from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday, April 28. The fair, which is dinosaur-themed this year, will have vendors, entertainers, rides and all the other sentimental fair festivities. Tickets are $5 to $8 for general admission and $30 for carnival wristbands. The fair will take place at the Earl Warren Showgrounds at 400 Calle Real, Santa Barbara. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87732\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87732\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/vista-point-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-16/","id":4197,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4196,4195,4194],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
