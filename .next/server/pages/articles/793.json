The Matadors, who currently lead the Big West in steals per game, beat UC Davis (1-16, 0-5) on Saturday after losing to Pacific (5-12, 1-4) and Long Beach State (12-6, 5-0).</p>\n<p>Freshman center Alan “Big Al” Williams has started the last three games for the Gauchos, contributing in a big way as a force inside. Williams has averaged 8.8 points per game and a team-leading 10.5 rebounds per game and 2.5 blocks per game, which both rank him second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Al is just a beast,” senior guard Orlando Johnson said of the freshman big man. “You can’t really keep him off the glass … He is so big and strong, but also very athletic.”</p>\n<p>Using Williams has allowed Coach Williams to play a bigger lineup, sliding senior forward Jaime Serna — who often starts at the center position — to power forward. Serna, who was hurt on Jan. 5 against Cal State Fullerton, missed the game at UC Riverside and played minimally against UC Irvine, but is expected to start tonight against the Matadors.</p>\n<p>“Our big lineup has been very productive for us,” Coach Williams said. “It allows us to be versatile off the bench and create some nice mismatches.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are 6-2 at home this season, with their only losses coming in overtime against San Diego State, and double overtime against UNLV in November. After two consecutive home games this weekend, Santa Barbara will hit the road, where it plays four straight — and seven of the next eight contests — away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“All home games are really important,” Coach Williams said. “You want to win games at home and take care of business as much as possible.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43666\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/ucsb-faces-csun-league-home-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43666\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/ucsb-faces-csun-league-home-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/ucsb-faces-csun-league-home-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/ucsb-faces-csun-league-home-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/ucsb-faces-csun-league-home-game/","id":793,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[792,791,790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush","biography":"Not available","articles":[721,733,736,737,740,754,756,757,759,761,764,774,780,783,784,787,788,791,792,793,796,799,800,806,810,811,813,821,822,824,834,839,841,907,1235,1736,1743,1745,1759,2282,2291,2301,2303,2789,2809,2826,2893,2895,2896,3496,5511,5515,5518,5522,5526,5527,5528,5532,5535,5537,5538,5539,5541,5545,5546,5553,5554],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Big West Conference: Women’s Basketball Preview","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UC Santa Barbara: Gauchos There’s been a lot of change for the UCSB women’s basketball team in the past year — a new coach and a new system — but last year’s co-champions of the Big West loo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>UC Santa Barbara:</strong> <strong>Gauchos</strong></p>\n<p>There’s been a lot of change for the UCSB women’s basketball team in the past year — a new coach and a new system — but last year’s co-champions of the Big West look ready to contend for another title.</p>\n<p>An adjustment period with new Head Coach Carlene Mitchell, whose team sits just below .500 at 6-7 with a 1-1 conference start, was to be expected.

We want to win.”</p>\n<p>In the Big West preseason polls, UCSB was predicted to finish second, right behind conference foe Cal Poly. The two teams received the same number of first place votes, but Cal Poly received more points overall.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos weren’t thinking about the polls. They were concerned with adjusting and readying themselves for conference play. Their preseason schedule included some stiff competition, such as St. Mary’s and Washington State.</p>\n<p>“I think we had a great schedule,” Johnson said. “It was tough and it prepared us for conference.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began conference on the road, facing rival Cal Poly first. As expected, the game went down to the wire. A three-point play by senior guard Ashlee Burns with 2.3 seconds remaining left the Gauchos winless to start conference for only the second time in the last 17 seasons.</p>\n<p>A week later, Mitchell earned her first conference win as head coach against Cal State Fullerton 39-37, although it wasn’t the Gauchos’ best showing.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing that hasn’t changed for the Gauchos this season, it’s their tenacious defense. UCSB allows opponents a mere 49.6 points per game, the best in the Big West and seventh in the nation. In eight of their past 10 games, their opponent hasn’t scored over 50 points. Furthermore, the Gauchos have held their opposition to 37 percent shooting, also first in the conference.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to try to outscore teams, but we’re going to try to make it hard on opponents on the defensive end,” Mitchell said. “That’s what I’m about and that’s what this program is about. We have to control what we can, which is defensive intensity.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, there is no apparent leader for UCSB. Certainly no player will be found atop the Big West rankings, but that is Mitchell’s strategy on offense: balance. UCSB has a deep team with many players who can make a difference.</p>\n<p>“Every player should have the confidence to be the go-to player if we need them to,” Mitchell said. “Then teams can’t focus on one player.”</p>\n<p>Currently, junior forward Sweets Underwood leads the team in scoring at 8.9 points per game. She is also second on the squad in rebounding at 7.8 per game, placing her sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[Sweets] has that ability to get a double-double every night,” Mitchell said. “Sweets understands we’re not asking too much for her and her athleticism.”</p>\n<p>While Johnson, who played for Team USA in October, has been inconsistent in finding her shooting touch thus far, she continues to lead her team by doing the less noticed things, like distributing the ball and getting steals. She leads the team in both categories with 2.8 assists and 1.2 steals per contest, while still averaging 8.4 points.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think [Emilie] has to score for this team to be successful,” Mitchell said. “She’s such an unselfish player, and she understands it’s important to be a distributor and set the tempo. If she has five or six assists, that means 10 or 12 points.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s other senior and captain, Kelsey Adrian, has recently found her stride in the new system, especially from behind the arc. The guard shoots 42.6 percent from three point land, good enough for second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The two sophomore guards Nicole Nesbit and Melissa Zornig have also proved themselves as offensive threats, averaging 8.6 and 8.2 points per game, respectively.</p>\n<p>“I think we have a good mix [of players],” Adrian said. “ We have some super athletic players and some shooters. We’re really complimentary of each other. We’re not as big as other teams, but we’re bigger and have bigger basketball IQs.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Kirsten Tilleman cleans up the paint under the hoop night in and night out. She ranks second in rebounds in the Big West at 8.6 per game.</p>\n<p>“[Kirsten] is instrumental to our success so far,” Mitchell said. “She has to guard the other teams’ tallest and most physical players. I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the effort and intensity every night.”</p>\n<p>As Coach Mitchell has preached all year, it most likely will be the little things that determine the Gauchos’ run for a title. Defense is their bread and butter, but rebounding and turnovers may make the difference.</p>\n<p>“Rebounding and limiting turnovers have been our keys all year long,” Adrian said. “We’re smaller, so blocking out is going to win or lose us games.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, Santa Barbara’s weakness seems to be consistent offensive production as they continue to work on executing on the offensive end. As a result, they score the least in conference at 51.1 points per game, but overall they still maintain the greatest scoring margin (+1.5).</p>\n<p>“We emphasize [defense],” Johnson said. “That’s been our identity: our toughness on that end of the floor.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host UC Riverside this Saturday in the Thunderdome at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: Mustangs</strong></p>\n<p>Cal Poly women’s basketball went 3-9 and lost seven consecutive games entering conference play. They opened conference with two straight wins. The lesson: last year’s Big West co-champions and this year’s predicted league champs by the preseason polls should never be counted out of the mix.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited and honored to be selected to win it, but we know we’re a long way off of that and know we have to earn it every single day,” Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh said. “We had some really good competition in preseason and I think it’s prepared us all for the great competition we’re going to face in the Big West.”</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs lost last year’s Big West Player of the Year, Rachel Clancy, they return with arguably an even more dangerous threat. Redshirt senior and 2009-10 Big West Player of the Year Kristina Santiago, who missed last year with a torn ACL, is back in action. Against San Diego State on Dec. 21, Santiago made the bold statement that she is completely back, tallying a career high 44 points.</p>\n<p>“We definitely have a different team, [which is] trying to put it together so we can have as successful a year,” Mimnaugh said. “Santiago is obviously one of the main reasons for that success. She is by all accounts an all-star and somebody that I’m sure the WNBA is having a really close look at as far as an addition to their league.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, the 6’1’’ forward has averaged 24 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. Both statistics are good enough to lead the Big West and nationally rank her fifth and 17th, respectively.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Ashlee Burns is Cal Poly’s third leading scorer at 8.8 points per game. Opponents should watch out for her three-point shooting; she averages 36.7 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Ashlee Burns has been a terrific three-point shooter and somebody we count on to extend the defense so they can’t completely collapse on Kristina,” Mimnaugh said.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Mustangs are extremely strong offensively, preferring high scoring games. They lead the Big West, averaging 72.1 points per outing. The also lead the league in field goal percentage (42 percent) and assists (14.4).</p>\n<p>“We love up-tempo,” Mimnaugh said. “If we can score in the 70s, we’re usually on the victory side.”</p>\n<p>Consequently, Cal Poly also allows their opponents the most points in the Big West, so their game plan is simple: outscore the other team.</p>\n<p><strong>Pacific: Tigers</strong></p>\n<p>The University of the Pacific was picked to finish eighth in the Big West in the Preseason Media Poll, but already has almost as many wins as they did all of last year. The Tigers went 5-11 in conference play last season (9-22 overall) and entered the Big West Tournament as the seventh seed. There, they upset second seed UCSB in the first round before falling to first seed Cal Poly in the second round.</p>\n<p>This season, Pacific is currently in third place in the conference at 2-1 (8-6 overall). The Tigers went 6-5 through a tough nonconference schedule, including a trip to second-ranked Connecticut, and feel they are prepared for Big West play.</p>\n<p>“Now we get into the rhythm of conference play,” Head Coach Lynne Roberts told pacifictigers.com. “The Big West is going to be a close race. We know [each game is] going to be very tough.”</p>\n<p>In its first conference game against Cal State Fullerton on Dec. 29, Pacific won 72-67. In its next showing on Jan. 5 at UC Irvine, the Tigers lost in overtime, 77-75, but rebounded with a big win on Jan. 7, 80-59 at UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>Early in the season, there were indications that the Tigers were on track for an improvement from last year. On Dec. 5, junior guard Erica McKenzie was named Big West Player of the Week, and on Dec. 12, junior guard Ashley Wakefield earned the same award. McKenzie averages 12.4 points per game, and Wakefield is the team’s leading scorer at 12.6 points per game. On the defensive side, sophomore guard Gena Johnson is third in the conference in blocked shots with 1.4 per game.</p>\n<p>One area Pacific has found success is from behind the arc. McKenzie has made a conference-leading 34 three-pointers thus far this season, and junior Kendall Rodriguez leads the conference in individual three-point field goal percentage with .440. Overall, the team has the second-best three-point field goal percentage in the Big West with .344.</p>\n<p>Roberts hopes that the team can sustain these areas of success, which have contributed to its exceeding expectations so far.</p>\n<p>“Our focus now is making sure our players understand we have momentum, but we’re not where we want to be yet,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis: Aggies</strong></p>\n<p>The UC Davis women’s basketball team enters the season as defending champions of the Big West conference, after making a run in the conference tournament as a fourth seed and losing to Stanford in the first round of the NCAA tournament. With new Head Coach Jennifer Gross at the helm, the Aggies have started the season 8-5 overall and 0-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>After replacing 14-year Head Coach Sandy Simpson, who went 24-9 overall and 10-6 in conference in his final season, new Head Coach Jennifer Gross is trying to bring a fast, up-tempo offense to the team, as well as a tough and physical mentality to both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“Although I am in my first year as the head coach at UC Davis, I have been a part of this Aggie program for the past eight years,” Gross said. “Of course, I have my own style as the head coach, but the overall philosophy of our program will remain the same.”</p>\n<p>This season the Aggies are led by their three senior captains. Senior guard Samantha Meggison started all 33 games last season, leading the team in steals with 61 and finishing second on the team with 66 assists. Meggison is leading the Aggies in points with 10.8 points per game and rebounds (4.5). Senior guard Hana Asano is averaging seven points and 3.5 assists per game. Senior forward Kasey Riecks is second on the team, with 10.2 points per game and is on pace to become the 15th Aggie to reach 1,000 career points.</p>\n<p>“Three of our seniors, Samantha Meggison, Kasey Riecks and Hana Asano have been very consistent so far,” Gross said. “Whether it is scoring, rebounding or getting us stops, they have been providing great leadership and have been very productive on the court.”</p>\n<p>After five straight wins to start the season, the Aggies have cooled off and are now 8-5 and 0-1 in conference. Davis is averaging 62.9 points per game, ranking sixth in the conference in offense, including a league-leading 7.6 threes per game, ranking them 14th in all of Division I. Defensively, they are only giving up 63.6 points to their opponents, forcing 19.9 turnovers a game.</p>\n<p>Gross is focused this year on building strong relations and competing as a unit, fielding a team that can be competitive night in and night out in a very even conference that is up for grabs. The Aggies’ goal for the season is to continue growing throughout the next few months and coming as close as possible to reaching their potential.</p>\n<p>“We have big picture goals like trying to go back to the NCAA tournament,” Riecks said. “But there’s a lot of goals within our team that we want to accomplish through each game, and its getting better every game, and the opportunity that we have to be on the court during practice is amazing.”</p>\n<p><strong>CSUN: Matadors</strong></p>\n<p>The Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team has already seen success this season, sitting at 8-7 overall and 3-0 in the Big West. Last year, the Matadors suffered through a 4-26 overall (4-11 Big West) season. Thus far, Northridge has defeated Irvine, Riverside and Long Beach to stand in first place in the conference.</p>\n<p>The Matadors are led by senior center Jasmine Erving, who averages 14.7 points per game and has started all 15 games so far, alongside freshman guard Ashlee Guay.</p>\n<p>Erving earned herself the Big West Player of the Week award the week of Nov. 28. She posted two consecutive double-doubles against Colgate and West Virginia.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 2, freshman guard Janae Sharpe also took home the Big West Player of the Week award, bringing CSUN women’s basketball its second of the season. Sharpe scored 19 points and had seven steals against UC Irvine, leading Northridge to its first league win of the season.</p>\n<p>In steals, Northridge only ranks behind Long Beach this season, partly due to freshman guard Ashlee Guay, who leads the team with 55. She and Sharpe, who has 29 steals, get the ball back for their offense and feed leading scorer Erving. Both Guay and Sharpe have 57 and 36 assists respectively.</p>\n<p>Northridge will face Pacific on the road and Cal Poly at home before facing Santa Barbara at home on Jan. 21.</p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton: Titans</strong></p>\n<p>After posting a 6-5 nonconference record, Fullerton has opened its Big West season by going 1-3.</p>\n<p>The Titans lost a close game at Pacific in its Big West opener 72-67, despite a fourth consecutive 20-point effort from senior guard Megan Richardson. Fullerton then upset UC Davis 58-50 two days later, and returned home 1-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>In the team’s home opener, four different Titans tallied double digit points, but Cal Poly won 76-69. On Saturday, Fullerton played host to visiting UCSB, who escaped with a narrow 39-37 victory.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Marcia Foster will be patrolling the sidelines in her third season with Fullerton, who a year after posting a 9-21 (5-11 Big West) overall record, was tabbed to finish fifth in the Conference Preseason Media Poll.</p>\n<p>Richardson was named to the preseason All-Conference team and is the squad’s returning leader in minutes per game (32) and points (14.7). Other returning starters include redshirt senior point guard Lauren Chow and sophomore guard Alex Thomas.</p>\n<p>An indication of Fullerton’s success may be how the team fares away from the friendly confines of Titan Gym. Last year, Fullerton was 3-14 on the road, including 2-6 in the Big West.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>CENTER: Andrew Bynum (LA Lakers)</p>\n<p>Pretty predictable, yet incredibly amazing. Four out of five starters from Los Angeles make up this extremely well-rounded team that should have chemistry right from the start. How much fun is Chris Paul going to have running the point for this team? — that is, until Kobe decides he wants a fifth All-Star game MVP and starts shooting (and making) fadeaway corner three-pointers with 20 seconds on the shot clock.</p>\n<p>RESERVES: Russell Westbrook (G, OKC Thunder), Monta Ellis (G, GS Warriors), Pau Gasol (F, LA Lakers), Kevin Love (F, MIN Timberwolves), LaMarcus Aldridge (F, POR Trail Blazers), Dirk Nowitzki (F, DAL Mavericks), Marc Gasol (C, MEM Grizzlies)</p>\n<p>HONORABLE MENTIONS: Kyle Lowry (G, HOU Rockets), Steve Nash (G, PHO Suns), James Harden (G, OKC Thunder), Danilo Gallinari (F, DEN Nuggets), Rudy Gay (F, MEM Grizzlies), David Lee (GS Warriors), Marcin Gortat (PHO Suns)</p>\n<p>It was hard to leave Lowry ­— who is having a huge breakout year — off the roster, but I just couldn’t give him the nod over Ellis, who seems to be overlooked every year. He could make the roster over one of the power forwards, and it would seem to be Nowitzki’s spot he would take. Dirk is having a down year for the Mavs, but I have to believe he will begin to turn it around. I think Nowitzki gets voted in partly based on his resume, and the fact that his team would be complete garbage without him.</p>\n<p>EASTERN CONFERENCE:</p>\n<p>GUARDS: Derrick Rose (CHI Bulls), Dwayne Wade (MIA Heat)</p>\n<p>FORWARDS: LeBron James (MIA Heat), Carmelo Anthony (NY Knicks)</p>\n<p>CENTER: Dwight Howard (ORL Magic)</p>\n<p>The East starters (and these will be the starters) might as well call themselves “The Monstars.” Five hall-of-famers, and five of the best eight players in the league make up the group. Can you say, fast break?</p>\n<p>RESERVES: Rajon Rondo (G, BOS Celtics), Deron Williams (G, NJ Nets), Ray Allen (G, BOS Celtics), Chris Bosh (F, MIA Heat), Josh Smith (F, ATL Hawks), Amar’e Stoudemire (F, NY Knicks), JaVale McGee (C, WAS Wizards)</p>\n<p>HONORABLE MENTIONS: Brandon Jennings (G, MIL Bucks), Jose Calderon (G, TOR Raptors), Joe Johnson (G, ATL Hawks), Andre Iguodola (F, PHI 76ers), Ryan Anderson (F, ORL Magic), Greg Monroe (F, DET Pistons), Tyson Chandler (C, NY Knicks)</p>\n<p>The East All-Stars were not too difficult to pick, apart from deciding who would back up Howard at center. The spot would normally belong to Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks, but he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury last week. I decided to give the spot to JaVale McGee over Tyson Chandler and Spencer Hawes. Chandler has the name recognition (and will probably get the spot) and Hawes is in the midst of a breakout year for a breakout team, but McGee has the athleticism and motor to thrive off the bench for the East. After all, the All-Star game is all about entertainment, and McGee averages a league-leading 3.2 blocks per game, and a respectable 2.5 poster dunks a game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>THOUGHTS:</p>\n<p>First off, look at those completely fake and totally not official starting lineups … And reserves, for that matter. WOW. The talent level in the NBA may be at an all-time high, and the days of Jamaal Magloire, Wally Szczerbiak and Mo Williams making the all-star team are clearly over. A young influx of superstar talent (Rose, Durant, Griffin, Love and Bynum) is currently fusing with an already thriving superstar crop (LeBron, Wade, Howard, Durant and Carmelo), while both groups battle with an aging class of all-time greats (Kobe, Allen and Nowitzki) who are refusing to pass the torch just yet. This All-Star game has the potential to contain as many as 12 hall-of-famers in it.</p>\n<p>The West has a much deeper team than the East, starting with its big men. This team may boast the conference’s scariest frontcourt since Shaquille O’Neal, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Chris Webber and Dirk Nowitzki combined in their respective primes in the 2002 All-Star game.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the East holds an advantage in athleticism and speed. With several players to run the lanes — and Rose, LeBron, Rondo and Wade to feed them the rock — we are sure to see several highlight dunks. But highlights don’t win games (although maybe they should in the All-Star game).</p>\n<p>Final score: West 144, East 139</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43623\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/starry-forecast-porushs-nba-allstar-predictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43623\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/starry-forecast-porushs-nba-allstar-predictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/starry-forecast-porushs-nba-allstar-predictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/starry-forecast-porushs-nba-allstar-predictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-18/starry-forecast-porushs-nba-allstar-predictions/","id":791,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[790,789,788],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Long Beach on National Stage","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This is what it’s all about.

Although it was not always pretty, as UCSB gave up 21 offensive rebounds and had 18 turnovers, the Gauchos were able to beat the Matadors by limiting them to 33.3 percent shooting on the night.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I thought it was an uninspired performance,” Head Coach Bob Williams said.</p>\n<p>The team knows it will need to turn in a better performance if it is to contend with first place Long Beach.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t assert ourselves energy-wise tonight,” Williams said. “Not one facet of what we did tonight will be good enough when we play Long Beach …We will be ready and play much more inspired on Saturday night than we did tonight.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach (13-6, 6-0) is currently first in the Big West and ranked No. 11 in the mid-major poll. The 49ers are coming off a 78-69 win on the road at Cal Poly on Thursday night. A team that thrives on a fast-paced dynamic offense, Long Beach State leads the Big West in scoring offense (74.4 points per game), scoring margin of victory (14 per game), and field goal percentage (47.7 percent).</p>\n<p>“You have to slow them down, they are by far the best transition offensive team,” Williams said of the 49ers. “They get out and fly offensively. We will have to contain [Casper] Ware — he is a one man wrecking crew — and keep them off the boards.”</p>\n<p>Ware, the senior Long Beach point guard who joined the Gauchos’ Johnson on the Wooden Award Preseason Top-50 list, ranks third in the Big West with 16.4 points per game. Long Beach senior forward T.J. Robinson and senior guard Larry Anderson rank 10th and 8th in the conference in scoring, with 14.7 and 12.6 points per game, respectively. Robinson leads the conference in rebounds with 10.3 per game.</p>\n<p>“They are a really good team, there is no doubt about it,” Williams said. “They get pretty fired up to play us. The taste of what happened in the Big West championships against us is something that they carry in their mouth. … We are going to have to fight that fire and beat their intensity.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers gained national notoriety for its amazingly tough nonconference schedule. At one time, Long Beach’s RPI (Rating Percentage Index, a measure of strength of schedule) was No. 1 in the country, after the veteran squad beat then No. 9 Pittsburgh and No. 14 Xavier, and played other nationally ranked squads to close decisions.</p>\n<p>“They play the toughest schedule they can get,” Williams said. “[Long Beach Head Coach Dan Monson] feels it makes his team battle tested, and is a great way to prepare them for the Big West.”</p>\n<p>The matchup at Long Beach may be even more important, given the Gauchos upcoming schedule. After facing the 49ers tomorrow night, UCSB plays seven of its next eight games on the road, including four straight away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“Those seven of eight games on the road is a daunting task,” Williams said. “We just have to focus and take care of business at home first.”</p>\n<p>UCSB hopes to capitalize on its home court advantage against Long Beach. The Gauchos are 6-2 at home this season, having only narrowly lost to No. 16 San Diego State in overtime and No. 14 UNLV in double overtime. With national television cameras in the Thunderdome, a crowded and rowdy student section is expected.</p>\n<p>“Some of the best crowds we have ever had have been at home this year,” Williams said. “It really pushes us on.”</p>\n<p>In the win over Northridge, both teams played zone defense the entire game, with the Matadors applying full-court pressure. Although CSUN leads the conference in steals per game, UCSB came out on top in all of the “hustle” categories, recording more rebounds, blocks and steals.</p>\n<p>Despite taking seven fewer shots than CSUN in the first half, UCSB entered the locker room with a 31-22 advantage. The Gauchos came out slow at the onset of the second half, and turnovers allowed the Matadors to run off an 11-0 run to take a 33-31 lead with 17 minutes remaining, Northridge’s first lead of the game. At that point, coach Williams had seen enough, and decided to sub in a fresh five off the bench.</p>\n<p>“I think that was the first time this year that I have [subbed in] five new,” Williams said. “There was just an energy on the floor that had to change. The great thing is that nobody hung their head, and they all played better when they went back in.”</p>\n<p>UCSB rallied and — behind a 13-0 run of their own — was able to stretch its lead to 57-40 with 6:30 to play. Unable to close out the Matadors UCSB once again let up on the gas, allowing CSUN to hang around. The Matadors got as close as seven with just over a minute left to play, but the Gauchos were able to close it out 69-61.</p>\n<p>Johnson, who was recently named to the Midseason Top 25 for the Wooden award, led UCSB with a game-high 21 points, and senior guard James Nunnally added 16. Sophomore forward Keegan Hornbuckle tallied seven points to go with a game-high five steals, and senior center Greg Somogyi recorded a game-high 10 rebounds and added two blocks.</p>\n<p>“Coach talks about being a spark off the bench, and I tried to do that for us tonight,” Somogyi said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Saturday’s game against Long Beach is set for 8 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-national-stage/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-national-stage/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-national-stage/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-national-stage/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-20/ucsb-hosts-long-beach-national-stage/","id":792,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[791,790,789],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
