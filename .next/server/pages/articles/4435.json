Community Services District (CSD), spoke at the meeting, saying the center has great potential to help I.V.</p>\n<p>“There are so many potential uses for the facility, and it can truly benefit the culture of Isla Vista, providing an outlet and a venue for positive activity,” he said.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, an I.V. resident since 2011 and board director for the I.V. Community Development Corporation (IVCDC), spoke during public comment to thank board members who have previously supported I.V.’s attempts to establish the community center.</p>\n<p>“From the abolition of the development agency to the granting of $485,000 in support of critical renovations to the building, the board has proven a steady ally to the sizable community of Isla Vista,” he said. “For that you have our appreciation.”</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock went on to list the possible uses for the building if the grant was acquired and funds were allocated to the center.</p>\n<p>“I believe all the residents will benefit from the sense of knowledge and community that comes from classes such as dancing or cooking or by sweating out the stresses of work and studying during live music shows,” he said.</p>\n<p>Eusterbrock also suggested the space could be used to host private events for a variety of members in the community, including quinceañeras and sorority and fraternity events.</p>\n<p>Skip Grey, assistant director of the Santa Barbara County General Services Department, is working on the application for the grant. Grey said that the grant will specifically be used for the I.V. Community Center.</p>\n<p>Grey said his department began working on this grant in December, and the application has already been completed. The Board of Supervisors’ motion Tuesday now authorizes Grey to submit the paperwork. He said the application is complete and due to the state on Feb. 23.</p>\n<p>According to Grey, the grant is competitive and is not awarded automatically. The winners of the grant are expected to be announced by June 30.</p>\n<p>General Services partnered with the County Community Services Department to complete the application because of its authority over affordable housing programs. General Services will perform the renovations on the community center if the funding is approved, though the two departments worked together to complete the request for funding.</p>\n<p>I.V. qualified for the grant due the number of affordable housing units built in recent years.<br>\n“Specifically, the grant rewards cities and counties that approve affordable housing programs and the County of Santa Barbara has done a good job of that,” Grey said.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, IVCDC and CSD board member, was not in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting but spoke to the Nexus on Monday to describe possible uses for the grant.</p>\n<p>If the grant was used to renovate the community center, Brandt said possible renovations could include replacing the roof of the building, creating a shade structure and possibly installing a garage-door-like opening on the side of the community center so that events could be held outdoors and indoors simultaneously.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75795\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75795\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/county-to-apply-for-grant-for-i-v-community-center/","id":4435,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[4434,4433,4432],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[2286,2364,2385,2391,2392,2400,2404,2416,2419,2421,2424,2425,2429,2430,2443,3574,3584,3601,3737,3749,3756,3757,3763,3786,3801,3806,3908,3910,3920,3925,3926,3952,4280,4291,4313,4352,4357,4386,4387,4388,4389,4392,4393,4394,4395,4403,4404,4406,4408,4409,4423,4426,4435,4442,4449,4465,4489,7780],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Beat CSUN in Final Home Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos' playoff hopes in danger after failing to sweep CSUN.

Freshman starting pitcher Shane Bieber managed to escape the inning, but the damage was done for UCSB. The Gauchos manufactured only one run in the sixth inning on a RBI hit by sophomore designated hitter/pitcher Greg Mahle.</p>\n<p>“We weren’t ready to go defensively and then we couldn’t adjust offensively later,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “They weren’t flat. They had energy, but their concentration level probably wasn’t where it needed to be.”</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Austin Pettibone’s complete-game shutout on Saturday clinched the series for the Gauchos as the team won 6-0. The right-hander delivered his best outing of the season, facing only 30 batters and throwing 85 pitches to pick up the win and improve to 3-1 on the year.</p>\n<p>“He had everything working today. He hit all his spots and when he does that he’s pretty unhittable,” senior left fielder Joey Epperson said. “The fastball was coming out of his hand well. He did a good job of being deceptive at times and throwing pitches where he wants in the strike zone.”</p>\n<p>UCSB led 2-0 in the eighth inning before adding four big insurance runs to extend its lead. After junior right fielder Cameron Newell scored from second base on a throwing error, the top half of Santa Barbara’s lineup capitalized on senior relief pitcher Michael Coates’s poor outing on the mound.</p>\n<p>Coates allowed two runs on a RBI triple by Maris and a double by Epperson, which drove Coates out of the game. Sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic capped off the inning with a single to bring Epperson home.<br>\nSanta Barbara previously scored two runs in the fourth inning on a two-run homerun by Epperson. With a runner on second base, Epperson smashed the ball opposite-field for his fourth homer on the year and first since March 16.</p>\n<p>“In that situation, mainly I was just trying put the barrel to the baseball and find a way to get that run in,” Epperson said. “And I wound up taking a good swing on the ball and it left the yard. With Pettibone pitching that was really all we needed.”</p>\n<p>In the first game of the series on Friday, the Gauchos’ four runs in the third inning was just enough, with the final score ending 4-3 in favor of UCSB. Newell singled to get the third inning started for the Gauchos and scored two outs later on a hit to the left side by Maris.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s senior pitcher Brycen Rutherford followed the Maris single by loading the bases, setting the stage for a two-run RBI hit from Nesovic. Freshman center fielder Andrew Calica singled one more time in the inning to give UCSB a 4-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara’s lineup gave UCSB the lead, Mahle’s versatility in the batter’s box and on the mound proved to be the difference in the game. After sophomore starting pitcher Justin Jacome gave up three runs in the sixth inning, Mahle came in relief with the bases loaded and pitched out of the jam to maintain UCSB’s lead.</p>\n<p>Mahle filled the stat sheet on the day. From the plate, Mahle went 2-3 with a walk and a run scored. His two innings pitched in relief secured the lead before sophomore closer Dillon Tate came on in the eighth and ninth inning to close the door on the Matadors.</p>\n<p>UCSB is back in action Tuesday against Pepperdine. The game is of critical importance in terms of UCSB qualifying for the NCAA tournament, given that the Waves are the last opponent the Gauchos will face with an RPI of above 40. Teams with an RPI above 40 have a considerable shot at earning an at-large bid, and as of now, Santa Barbara has an RPI of 52.</p>\n<p>First pitch tomorrow is set for 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 12, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55266\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55266\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/","id":4432,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4431,4430,4429],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Series At San Francisco","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-13.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-13.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After going 2-1 against USF, the Gauchos clinched the program’s best non-conference win percentage in a single season by improving to 22-5-1 in non-conference games.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the second consecutive weekend, the UCSB baseball team entered its series finale against the University of San Francisco with a chance to sweep, yet, after digging itself into an early deficit, the team once again failed to win its final game of the series, losing yesterday by a score of 8-4.</p>\n<p>After Sunday’s loss, the Gauchos’ record stands at 31-17-1 and 9-12 in Big West.

The left-hander gave up five runs on eight hits before getting pulled from the game in favor of sophomore relief pitcher Dillon Tate.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>By the end of four innings, UCSB trailed 5-2 and failed to pull any closer, scoring just two more runs before eventually losing.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss, the result for the Gauchos was a lot different from the previous two games played.</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Austin Pettibone delivered his second consecutive complete-game shutout on Saturday en route to a 6-0 win by UCSB. Pettibone went the distance to improve his record to 4-1 on the year, giving up only five hits, a walk and striking out a season-high 10 batters.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara manufactured two runs in the first inning by way of stolen bases and singles. After senior left fielder Joey Epperson got on board via hit by pitch, he stole second base and scored on a RBI hit by sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic. Nesovic later advanced to scoring position and came home on a base hit by junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>While Pettibone cruised past USF’s lineup, the Gauchos tacked on one more run in the fourth inning to push their lead to 3-0. Junior right fielder Scott Quinlan advanced to third base by stealing two bases after he singled and scored on a RBI groundout by junior second baseman Woody Woodward.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos scored one more run in the sixth on a RBI single by sophomore utility Devon Gradford, and twice again in the eighth to complete the 6-0 route.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had a hot start to the series opener on Friday and never looked back, winning 10-4. In the first inning with runners on the corners, Nesovic came up to bat and singled to score Epperson from third base. An error by USF scored another run for the Gauchos to extend their lead to 2-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB went on to score three more runs in the second inning by converting on its bases loaded opportunity. With a runner on each base, the Gauchos’ first run of the frame came by way of pass ball. Nesovic then followed with a bases clearing double that scored two additional runs. Santa Barbara came out of the inning leading by five runs.</p>\n<p>USF earned a run in the third inning off of sophomore starting pitcher Justin Jacome, but the Dons were unable to produce any big run innings in the game. San Francisco’s biggest inning came in the fifth when it scored two runs, but Jacome kept the Dons’ offense on check. In 7.2 innings of work, Jacome limited USF to just six hits and struck out four on his way to picking up his seventh win on the year, the most on the staff.</p>\n<p>UCSB scored five more times in the game, including a homerun by Quinlan in the fifth inning, his first of the season. Quinlan’s 2-5 performance from the plate was just one of the Gauchos’ many solid hitting performances on the day. Epperson had a perfect game from the batter’s box, hitting 3-3 and walking in his three other plate appearances. Nesovic had three RBI in his four-hit game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara now awaits its final series of the season this weekend against conference opponent, UC Davis.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 19th, 2014th’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/","id":4433,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4432,4431,4430],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Santa Barbara Plans For Next Year With New Recruiting Class","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-06.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-06.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB could potentially bring in as many as 13 recruits for next season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As the UCSB baseball team’s season winds down, Head Coach Andrew Checketts is already making moves heading into next year.

Carter throws a fastball that clocks in as high as early 90’s MPH and can control the strike zone.</p>\n<p>Clements went a combined 20-2 his last two years in high school and comes in with an above average changeup, coupled with excellent command of the strike zone.</p>\n<p>“[Clements’] won a ton of games, struck out a lot of hitters, pounds the strike zone,” Checketts said. “He has the ability to be a starter … He can come in and do something immediately.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has power lined up in the form of 6’5’’, 240-pound first baseman Austin Bush. The left-handed batter will need to work on decreasing his hit-or-miss approach at the plate, but the slugger’s frame can provide a homerun threat in the middle of the lineup for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Power is really hard to find in college baseball, there’s just not a lot of guys that hit two words,” says Checketts. “He’s athletic and can feel his position for a big guy. He’s got a chance to come in to compete for the first base job immediately.”</p>\n<p>Another player with the same frame as Bush is right-handed pitcher Austyn Willis out of Barstow High. The speed on his fastball can reach the upper 80’s. In his final year in high school, Willis made 11 appearances and had a 2.85 ERA.</p>\n<p>UCSB has also recruited from within Santa Barbara with the addition of Santa Barbara City College’s Patrick O’Brien. In 35 games played for SBCC, the catcher hit .299 and had 27 runs to go along with 13 RBI. With current starting catcher Jackson Morrow set to graduate, O’Brien’s experience puts him in position to start right away and fill the hole left by Morrow.</p>\n<p>Shane Mardirosian from Martin Luther King High School in Riverside is another potential player for UCSB. The infielder’s elite speed and bat speed makes him a lock to get drafted, says Checketts. Depending how high Mardirosian gets selected will decide if he plays for the Gauchos come next season.</p>\n<p>As of now, the Gauchos are saying goodbye to four seniors from this year’s team, including left fielder Joey Epperson, who has arguably been the best hitter in the lineup for UCSB this season. However, the team has built a strong recruiting class that could contribute to a Big West title next year for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 22, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55464\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55464\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/","id":4434,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4433,4432,4431],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
