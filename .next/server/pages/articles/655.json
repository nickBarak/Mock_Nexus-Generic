The sophomore guard made 5-of-7 attempts from beyond the arc, racking up 15 points.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the game up aggressively, leading 27-21 at the end of the first quarter; however, the Lumberjacks found a way to turn things around before halftime. NAU’s ability to out-rebound the Gauchos 43-38, al while forcing 11 total turnovers were instrumental parts of its effort to stay in the game.</p>\n<p>Additionally, big performances from Lumberjacks Olivia Lucero and Kenna McDavis powered Northern Arizona’s big offensive night. The duo of redshirt seniors combined for 47 points, with Lucero pouring on a game-high 26 to go along with a game-high 11 assists.</p>\n<p>McDavis, a forward, went to work on the glass, grabbing a game-high 13 boards. UCSB scored 18 points in the quarter. With the momentum shifting, the Lumberjacks led 47-45.</p>\n<p>After the break, Santa Barbara regained its composure, stepping it up offensively by utilizing its skilled forward in the paint. The Gauchos fed Edelman in the third quarter, allowing the redshirt senior to score nine in the period as part of a 30-point quarter to regain the lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s bench outscored the Lumberjack second rotation 26-14, fueling a comeback of sorts after the lackluster second quarter. With Norther Arizona also having a strong offensive quarter, the 30-point quarter for Santa Barbara only gave the Gauchos a 75-72 lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos demonstrated great composure down the stretch Friday, never trailing in the final quarter to the persistent Lumberjacks. Using a clutch three-pointer from Hernandez and free-throws from Bates, the Gauchos held on to win 96-93.</p>\n<p>Despite the win, Santa Barbara got beat in the paint Friday, being outrebounded as mentioned and outscored in the paint 44-36. Notably, UCSB only forced five turnovers and failed to convert any of those turnovers into buckets while the Lumberjacks scored 14 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>While there’s obviously a learning curve one game into the season, it seems the Gauchos have all the pieces for success this year. Some tweaks on defense will need to be made, but the team’s mix of returnees and newcomers such as Bates makes UCSB a tough team to gameplan against.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79658\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79658\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/","id":655,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[654,653,652],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift","biography":"Not available","articles":[32,33,42,202,203,206,218,221,598,603,655,675,681,691,696,747,770,781,819,837,838,846,865,898,938,944,945,946,950,969,997,1209,1212,1213,1214,1330,1836,1849,1871,4876,4887,4890,4908,4909,4910,4911,4912,4913,4914],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Crunch Time in the NBA: the Playoff Picture","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The NBA season is almost three-quarters the way through.

Now is the time when we start seeing which teams are real contenders for an NBA title and which teams can pull through to earn those final playoff spots.</p>\n<p>Here’s a look around the NBA and where teams stand in the playoff picture:</p>\n<p>In the Eastern Conference, it would be no surprise if Miami returned to the NBA finals. The Heat has won 15 straight games, hitting its stride at the right time, going into playoffs, just like it did last year. And despite how difficult it is to win back-to-back MVP awards, LeBron James is the best option for the award at the moment after becoming the first player to go six games averaging 30 or more points while shooting over 50 percent from the field.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A little further down in the standings is Chicago. Derrick Rose has yet to play this season after tearing his ACL in the playoffs last year. When he will return remains a mystery, but against the Pacers three days ago, Rose returned to the bench, giving his team hope. Without Rose, I don’t see the Bulls going too far into the playoffs, although they have raised some eyebrows this year, currently in fourth place without their leader.</p>\n<p>Not to say that the squad isn’t still extremely talented with players like Joakim Noah and Luol Deng. My worry with Rose is that he could come back too early. There’s been a lot of pressure for him to return and knees can be extremely vulnerable after serious injuries like an ACL tear. If it were me, I’d take my time coming back.</p>\n<p>If there’s one team that I think will contend with Miami, it will be Indiana. The Heat isn’t a big team, preferring to play with a small lineup and put James at the power forward and has struggled when other teams pound the ball inside.</p>\n<p>Last year, Indiana and the Heat matched up in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Miami took the series 4-2, but it didn’t come with ease. This season Indiana is an undefeated 2-0 against the defending champs and both victories have come by at least 10 points.</p>\n<p>Paul George is having a stellar year, averaging 17.6 points and nearly eight rebounds per contest. Yet, the Pacers have plenty of great players around him with David West, George Hill and Roy Hibbert all averaging double digit scoring. With Danny Granger coming back from injury, I’d expect to see Indiana in the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>\n<p>In the Western Conference, San Antonio currently has the best record in the NBA at 47-14, but it will be interesting to see how the Spurs do down the stretch. The team just lost Tony Parker, who certainly was a candidate for MVP, due to an ankle sprain and will be out for four weeks. Parker was having arguably the best season of his career, averaging 26.1 points, 8.3 assists and four rebounds per game. He was also shooting about 54 percent from the field. The team will need its veterans like Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan to step up.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Spurs were the leading team in the west going into playoffs as well, but were beaten by Oklahoma City in the Western Conference Finals. Personally, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the same happen again this year. San Antonio is full of veterans that know how to win, but the athleticism and young talent of OKC will be too much to handle for the Spurs.</p>\n<p>Finally, fighting for a playoff spot in the west has been Houston. They’ve currently taken the seventh spot in conference, primarily due to the outstanding play of James Harden. The ex-Thunder player now has the spotlight on him. There’s no Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook to overshadow him and Harden has delivered.</p>\n<p>While I thought he might struggle due to the fact that opponents could key in on him, Harden has stepped up his game. He’s averaging 26.2 points per game compared to 16.8 points per game last season. He’s also dishing 5.7 assists per game, over two more than last year. Houston might not be a contender for a title, but Harden had certainly solidified himself as one of the great scorers in the game today.</p>\n<p>With a full season this year, injuries will certainly come into play as many teams start to get worn down from the taxing schedule. My prediction is that there will be a rematch of last year’s NBA finals with Miami taking on OKC. That wouldn’t be too bad as fans would once again be treated to two of the best players in the game going head to head.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of March 6th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50515\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50515\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/crunch-time-in-the-nba-the-playoff-picture/","id":652,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[651,650,649],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sacramento Kings Build Momentum at UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Sacramento Kings opened training camp at UCSB Tuesday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_52281\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52281\" data-attachment-id=\"52281\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/attachment/127/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?fit=3888%2C2592&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3888,2592\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XTi\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1380630707\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"17\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"127\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-52281\" alt=\"127\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127-1024x682.jpg?resize=610%2C406\" width=\"610\" height=\"406\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-52281\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Sacramento Kings started their 2013-2014 season at UCSB yesterday.

Hopefully this is an opportunity for us to bond, unite and build the chemistry and trust you need. This is a great facility at UCSB, a great city and I think all of our guys are pretty happy to be here.”</p>\n<p>According to Director of Public Relations Chris Clark , the location for the Kings training camp was between Santa Barbara and one other location. However, when Kings Staff checked the site in August, they decided UCSB was the perfect place.</p>\n<p>“You’re always looking for somewhere that can relax your guys,” Clark said. “It’s a long season, 82 games. Santa Barbara gives us the chance to come to a beautiful locale, good weather and good facilities. When you combine all those things, it was an easy decision.”</p>\n<p>Sacramento will be conducting training camp at UCSB until Sunday, Oct. 6 at which point they will travel to face Golden State in their first preseason game of the season Oct. 7.</p>\n<p>Golden State may be a familiar opponent to many members of the Kings, as Malone was an assistant with the Warriors during last season’s impressive campaign.</p>\n<p>Other members of the Kings’ front office that hold ties to the Warriors community include advisor Chris Mullin (Warriors’ Hall of Famer and former GM), owner Vivek Ranadive (former part-owner of Warriors) and General Manager Pete D’Alessandro (former Warriors’ assistant GM).</p>\n<p>“Obviously I was a part of [the Warriors] the last two years,” Malone said. “We wish them well, but we’re doing our own thing. This is about the Sacramento Kings. It’s just a new day for Sacramento and the fact that a lot of people came up from the bay is just a coincidence.”</p>\n<p>After undergoing much turmoil in the form of ownership issues and a possible relocation to Seattle in previous seasons, the Kings can finally get away from all the off-court drama associated with the franchise and focus back on the court.</p>\n<p>“Not having you guys have to ask me if we’re going to be staying this year is definitely good and it’s great for the fans too,” forward Jason Thompson said. “On the court, the mindset has changed too. We’re going to be a defensive team that can get out and score. We’ll be a fun team to watch.”</p>\n<p>With a new era under Malone comes a new style of play, which looks to dramatically improve on the defensive end for a team that ranked last in points allowed per game last season by a large margin.</p>\n<p>“I want to defend and from the defense, everything else will come,” Malone said. “We still want to run, but we want to run with discipline. None of that will happen if we don’t commit to defending and rebounding at a high level.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, the new regime wants a more unselfish style of play, as evidenced by the team’s move to send Tyreke Evans to New Orleans in exchange for point guard Greivis Vasquez, who ranked third in the NBA last season with 9.0 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Combined with fellow point guard Isaiah Thomas, the Kings look set at a position that was so often reliant on the shoot-first Evans.</p>\n<p>“What I loved today was that [we had] two highly competitive players fighting for a starting job pushing each other,” Malone said. “We have two very talented point guards that will hopefully lead us to a lot of wins this year.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the Kings is center DeMarcus Cousins, who was recently signed to a four-year $62 million deal that clearly shows the team’s trust in Cousins to become the franchise player that will once again lead them to the postseason.</p>\n<p>Other notable players in attendance include John Salmons, Thomas, Marcus Thornton, Ben McLemore and Jason Thompson.</p>\n<p>Now that a new season has arrived for a franchise with a much changed makeup, the Kings will try and improve upon last season’s 28-54 record and possibly contend for a playoff spot in the ultra-competitive Western Conference.</p>\n<p>“Obviously the goal is to make the playoffs,” Guard Jimmer Fredette said. “We want to move forward as an organization and as a team and get better each and every day.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly seems like the perfect place for a franchise searching for a fresh start and if the vibe from the Kings training camp is any indication, a little bit of Santa Barbara may be just what the Kings needed to start off the season on a high note.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 3 of October 2, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kristen Henneman of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52279\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52279\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/","id":653,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[652,651,650],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Battle For Position, Host Titans","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With a postseason conference birth already clinched, the eighth-place UCSB men’s basketball team has a chance to improve its standing tonight when it hosts seventh-place Cal State Fullerton.

The Titans previously defeated UCSB 86-79 on their home floor to open conference play on Dec. 29 and were led by senior forward Sammy Yeager’s 30 points on 8-11 shooting from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“They have some big time scorers on their team,” Boswell said. “We know that their strength is to score the basketball, so … we’ve got to contest shots on the defensive end and we’ll have a good shot at winning.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton currently ranks first in the conference and eighth in the nation, averaging 78.4 points per game. Fullerton is capable of lighting up the scoreboard any night and features the second, third and eighth leading scorers in the conference in senior guards D.J. Seeley and Kwame Vaughn to compliment Yeager.</p>\n<p>“They’re one of the top teams in the nation in terms of scoring the basketball,” Boswell said. “If we can limit their shot attempts and good shots that they get, we’ll be in good shape.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has struggled with injuries for much of the season but is finally looking healthier with Boswell, sophomore center Alan Williams and junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle all returning from injury in the last few weeks. Guard Nate Garth, the team’s lone senior, returned to practice Tuesday and may return to the lineup in time for senior night Saturday.</p>\n<p>Big Al will be the focus for the Gauchos’ offense tonight as Fullerton possesses a lineup full of capable scoring guards but lacks depth in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to hurt them on the glass, hurt them inside, we need to make them pay for being undersized,” Coach Williams said. “We need to play to our advantage, which should be our strength and our size and how physical we should be inside.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1384689356\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50535\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50541\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-07/gauchos-battle-for-position-host-titans/magaligauthier_mbasketball_11112-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=300%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"300,520\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1351806281\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"6400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.001\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=144%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=300%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50541\" alt=\"MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112 (1)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11-144x250.jpg?resize=144%2C250\" width=\"144\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?resize=144%2C250&amp;ssl=1 144w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\">MAGALI GAUTHIER / DAILY NEXUS</span></h6>\n<h6>Senior guard Nate Garth missed eight games with a hamstring injury but returned to practice this week.
