Unlike his opponent, who has no prior experience with the office, Reul has worked in the office for the last six months and has attained enough experience to know what the office needs.</p>\n<p>He also has a concrete plan ready to maintain and improve upon the current functions of the office with specific points, which makes him a better choice than his opponent. While Reul plans on keeping all the current employees of the office, something his opponent has also stated she would do, his plan for the office is more concrete. This includes a much needed modernization of the SAG website, advocacy workshops and outreach to various student organizations to create safe houses in Isla Vista, continuation of the Legal Observers program as well as efforts to increase communication with advocacy offices on other UC campuses.</p>\n<p>While his platform primarily focuses on continuing the work begun by his predecessor, the unique situation of a resignation in the middle of the current term of the SAG presents challenges not faced by candidates that would otherwise come into the office in June. While we support his opponent’s commitment to keeping the advocacy and casework aspects of the office unified, her lack of prior experience with the office and with Associated Students places her at a disadvantage we believe makes her the less suitable choice for the office.</p>\n<p><strong>External Vice President of Local Affairs: Cameron Schunk</strong></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"57812\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-03/associated-students-special-election-endorsements-2014/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?fit=480%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"480,480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?fit=480%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-57812\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=300%2C300\" alt=\"10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10309343_353627014789114_1836649702576882732_n.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">The <em>Daily Nexus</em> endorses Cameron Schunk for the position of External Vice President of Local Affairs. Although running unopposed, Schunk’s heavy involvement in efforts toward Isla Vista self-governance make him the perfect candidate for the position of EVPLA.</p>\n<p>With a well-informed understanding of possible forms of self-governance, particularly in the process of making I.V. a community services district or legislative district, Schunk has already taken initiative to make I.V. a safer place by founding Students for a Safer Isla Vista, forming relationships with county officials and local legislators and by helping to lead I.V. self-governance town halls. Schunk’s plans to actively reach out to Latino families in I.V. and to address sexual assault by providing survivors safe opportunities to share their experiences with the community are goals that we feel appropriately address some of I.V.’s most pressing issues. In addition, his plans to increase EVPLA presence online, put the I.V. Community Center to use and document housing conditions in I.V. are goals we feel Schunk has the ability to deliver.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, his passion for using the EVPLA position as an avenue to forward the movement toward self-governance for I.V. makes him best suited for the job.</p>\n<h2><strong>Fee Endorsements</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>A.S. Legal Resource Center</strong></p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> does not endorse the proposed fee increase of $9.37 per student per Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer Quarters beginning Fall 2015 and decreasing to $6.84 in Fall 2019 for the Associated Students Legal Resource Center. Much of the increased funding would go to a Sobering Center program in Isla Vista that would allow first timer offenders of alcohol-related crimes to stay in a building until they sober up, ultimately avoiding a court case or jail time. We believe that the establishment of a Sobering Center would both incentivize irresponsible behavior in regards to reducing the consequences for underage drinking as well as discriminate unfairly against non-UCSB students who are residents of I.V. and would be denied assistance by the new center. The Sobering Center seeks to essentially augment and subvert the traditional legal process for drunk in public offenses for those fortunate enough to attend UCSB, while doing nothing for the broader community.</p>\n<p>We recognize the importance of the A.S. Legal Resource Center in assisting students with legal issues and providing legal advice and therefore would be inclined to support a fee increase if funds were being allocated directly to improve the current functions of the office and if the requested amount were not as steep as it currently stands.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Since its first blood drive in Oct. 2011, the Alumni Association has drawn over 638 participants to donate blood.</p>\n<p>Alumni Association spokesperson Rocio Torres said the drive is one of many events hosted at Mosher Alumni House geared toward bridging the campus with the community.</p>\n<p>“One of our goals at the Alumni Association is provide service opportunities for alumni and students,” Torres said.</p>\n<p>Third-year geohydrology major Kaitlyn Smith said she has donated blood over 10 times since she has been to college.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great way to help people,” Smith said, “because if I needed blood, I would like it to be available.”</p>\n<p>The United Blood Services Regional Donor Recruitment Director for the Santa Barbara area Scott Edward said the amount of discomfort individuals experience when donating blood is a minor cost in comparison to its potential benefits.</p>\n<p>“The process itself is very straightforward,” Edward said. “That moment of discomfort is so small that it’s easy to put it out of your mind.”</p>\n<p>According to Edward, the blood from the drive will be given to local hospitals, as Santa Barbara is not big enough to supply blood to other areas.</p>\n<p>“We have weekly demands so consistency is key to maintaining the blood supply,” Edward said. “During the winter holiday season and summertime, donations can easy decrease, so we launch special campaigns to raise awareness and encourage donations.”</p>\n<p>Donor recruiter and blood drive scheduler Maricela Carpinteyro said maintaining a sufficient supply is not easy.</p>\n<p>“With the needs of the hospitals, we usually need about 130 pints of blood everyday to meet the hospital’s needs,” Carpinteyro said. “It’s a challenge especially since not everybody could give to everybody.”</p>\n<p>According to Edward, students should spend the time to give blood because it can have far-reaching positive effects for others.</p>\n<p>“You can save a lot of lives,” Edward said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

in next Tuesday’s upcoming midterm election.</p>\n<p>Newsom was joined by Congresswoman for CA-24th district Lois Capps and 37th district assemblyman for Santa Barbara and Ventura counties Das Williams in congratulating the university for clocking in this year at 7,152 students registered to vote in under three weeks. The speakers discussed the essential role the student voice has on impacting issues such as anti-cyclic steam injection ban Measure P and Capps’s consistent reelection.</p>\n<p>Newsom said he urges students to vote in next week’s election because of Capps’ close congressional race against Republican candidate, film actor and businessman Chris Mitchum.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57623\" style=\"width: 399px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Newsom-at-UCSB-by-Kenneth-Song_for-10.29.2014-3298.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"990968048\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57623\" data-attachment-id=\"57623\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/prominent-politicians-visit-campus/newsom-at-ucsb-by-kenneth-song_for-10-29-2014-3298/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Newsom-at-UCSB-by-Kenneth-Song_for-10.29.2014-3298.jpg?fit=1600%2C1136&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1136\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1414602161\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"130\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Newsom at UCSB by Kenneth Song_for 10.29.2014-3298\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Newsom-at-UCSB-by-Kenneth-Song_for-10.29.2014-3298.jpg?fit=250%2C178&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Newsom-at-UCSB-by-Kenneth-Song_for-10.29.2014-3298.jpg?fit=888%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57623\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Newsom-at-UCSB-by-Kenneth-Song_for-10.29.2014-3298-1024x727.jpg?resize=389%2C277\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"389\" height=\"277\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Newsom-at-UCSB-by-Kenneth-Song_for-10.29.2014-3298.jpg?resize=1024%2C727&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Newsom-at-UCSB-by-Kenneth-Song_for-10.29.2014-3298.jpg?resize=250%2C178&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Newsom-at-UCSB-by-Kenneth-Song_for-10.29.2014-3298.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57623\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“This is one of the most competitive Congressional races in the United States,” Newsom said. “So for those that think ‘my vote doesn’t matter, there’s hundreds of thousands of people,’ this race literally could come down to a few hundred votes and so everybody’s vote does matter. As a student, your interests are at stake in this election.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats vice president of events and fourth-year geology major Sam Goldman said although the university’s position as the number one university for voter registration is commendable, the achievement can be misleading.</p>\n<p>“You want to make sure that voter registration turns into actual voting,” Goldman said. “It is obviously really awesome, and it does reflect a campus that is active and concerned with what’s going on around us. But hopefully the momentum from this event will get people excited and will carry over to election day.”<br>\nCapps said that students have a significant impact on the outcome of her race.</p>\n<p>“It’s a concentration of votes that I appreciate for my race because this race is really a tough one and so it might give me the margin of victory,” Capps said. “My husband won a congressional seat and he won by the margin of the number of students who voted in Isla Vista and at UCSB. I always try to share that with students about the importance of student votes.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, students play a large role in deciding whether or not future cyclic steam injection, acidizing or fracking will occur in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Santa Barbara is regarded in many places as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement and that is an important legacy,” Williams said. “We had hundreds of applications in the last year [for drilling new wells] and many would be with the most dangerous, the most water intensive and the highest carbon emissions of techniques that are out there.”</p>\n<p>According to Campus Democrats President and fourth-year chemistry major Krishna Hammond, as election day grows closer Campus Democrats will continue to promote the importance of voting to students and Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>For the “I’ve got a big clock counting down in my head ‘til election day,” Hammond said. “We’re going to be knocking on doors, calling people, going around the neighborhood, waving signs at people; basically everything you possibly can to get people to come out.”</p>\n<p>Newsom said he believes Campus Democrats’ efforts are important to help “reconcile the apathy that exists with young folks in the electoral process at all levels.”</p>\n<p>“We have an obligation to be active citizens,” Newsom said. “Young folks have the capacity to amplify their voices in a way that is unique in this generation. There are a lot of young folks that have the absolute ability to change things radically, but only if they exercise their voice and are more participatory in the life of their campus.”</p>\n<p>A

and author Kati Marton held a talk at Corwin Pavilion on Wednesday regarding her book, <em>The Great Escape: Nine Jews Who Fled Hitler and Changed the World</em>.</p>\n<p>The Hungarian-born daughter of journalists who spent two years in prison for false charges of spying, and the granddaughter of Jews who were killed at Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust, Marton moved with her family to Maryland in 1956 following the Hungarian Revolution.</p>\n<p>Marton’s book follows the lives of nine influential figures, including physicists Leo Szilard, Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, who convinced Albert Einstein to warn then-President Franklin Roosevelt of Germany’s development of nuclear weapons and paved the way for the Manhattan Project, as well as many other reputable figures such as inventor John von Neumann,<em> Darkness at Noon</em> author Arthur Koestler, photographers Robert Capa and Andre Kertesz as well as filmmakers Alexander Korda and Michael Curtiz, who directed <em>Casablanca </em>and other well-known films.</p>\n<p>Marton said she chose the nine individuals because they all spent time in her birthplace of Budapest. According to Marton, she wanted to investigate the influence the ancient European capital had on each character and their intellect.</p>\n<p>“Nobody had created a group out of them, and that was what I tried to do, to discover what was in the espresso in Budapest that had created this fantastic explosion of talent,” Marton said.</p>\n<p>Marton said although the nine men were secular Jews, their lives also began to change with the mass persecution of Jewish people at the time.</p>\n<p>“[The nine] were very aware of the fact that their parents and grandparents had not been given these opportunities; that just a generation before, they had been stuck in muddy villages … with very limited scope for ambition,” Marton said. “So they were men in a hurry.”</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Lyiam Galo was one of the Instructional Development students who filmed the event for UCTV, and said Marton’s talk effectively handled unsettling topics while making them accessible to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>“[Marton] was super receptive to questions,” Galo said. “The subject matter was dark, but she managed to incorporate humor.”</p>\n<p>This event was the first of nine that will be hosted this year by the Taubman Symposia in Jewish Studies at UCSB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57701\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/author-discusses-book-in-corwin/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57701\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/author-discusses-book-in-corwin/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/author-discusses-book-in-corwin/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/author-discusses-book-in-corwin/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/author-discusses-book-in-corwin/","id":2991,"author":{"id":180,"name":"Jason Chun"},"related":[2990,2989,2988],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
