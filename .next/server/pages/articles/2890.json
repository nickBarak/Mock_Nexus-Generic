Throughout the event, Active Minds aimed to encourage discussion on the changing climate of the conversation on eating disorders and how to decrease the stigma surrounding the issue.</p>\n<p>Health and Wellness advisor Joanna Hill said because eating disorders are unique from many other addictions, they can be difficult to treat.</p>\n<p>“Eating disorders are different than other addictions, like alcohol or drugs because you have to eat every day,” Hill said. “CAPS [Counseling &amp; Psychological Services] is a good starting place. With eating disorders, the ideal trifecta is a registered dietician, a medical doctor and counseling or a therapist, and so if you go into any one of those areas they can help connect you into the rest of the resources.”</p>\n<p>Hosford Counseling and Psychological Services Clinic eating disorder specialist Lana Smith Hale said eating disorders are a coping mechanism that are usually linked to deeper issues.</p>\n<p>“Finding what that is for each person is part of what the experience of like working on your issues,” Smith Hale said. “The deeper issues might be anxiety, depression, obsessive thoughts, trauma, low self-esteem, family issues – it can vary. Eating disorders aren’t about the food, it’s usually about something deeper.”</p>\n<p>Smith Hale said people suffering from eating disorders should be encouraged to reach out for support and educated on how to connect with resources.</p>\n<p>“For somebody who has an eating disorder, to really take that step is such an act of strength to reach out for support,” Smith Hale said. “If that means calling a friend, getting involved with a new club, going to student health, going to CAPS, but beginning to take that step forward is so important in getting help.”</p>\n<p>Active Minds co-founder and fourth-year psychology major Lilia Goldenberg said she is passionate about mental health because herself and her family members have dealt with mental health issues.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that runs in my family,” Goldenberg said. “It’s something that I’ve had so many friends talk to about. It’s prevalent in my life. Something I’ve always noticed is that a lot of people don’t talk about it in open spaces and it comes out in ways that aren’t necessarily healthy ways it may come out.”</p>\n<p>Active Minds co-founder and fourth-year communication and psychology double-major Carly Chianese said she feels strongly about eliminating the stigma surrounding eating disorders.</p>\n<p>“I just think it’s very important to start the conversation about mental health and that is what this club stands for,” Chianese said. “Just that it can be such a cathartic experience even if you’re not suffering yourself to be able to alleviate some of those feelings … and to educate our campus because the more people know, the less people are going to stigmatize.”</p>\n<p>According to Goldenberg, it is important that university campuses provide a variety of resources for individuals struggling with eating disorders.</p>\n<p>“It creates a space where people can talk about things. Instead of just talking to your friends about it, which isn’t always the most comfortable space to, they can come here and be with likeminded people,” Goldenberg said. “It’s difficult to reach communities that don’t want to be reached. So we’re trying to get people whose ears haven’t already heard the story.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Food Co-op manager Melissa Cohen said the Co-op can help individuals who are suffering with eating disorders by helping “to create community through food.”</p>\n<p>“Our store has become what it was meant to be, which is a hub for education, outreach, tours, nutrition education,” Cohen said. “It’s not really about doing all your shopping at the Co-op, it’s about knowing there’s a place in the community that brings together people, community and food into one place to create a really fun shopping experience. Our mission is not selling groceries, our mission is creating access to healthy food in the most affordable way possible.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said the Co-op can help everyone, including those with eating disorders, to get access to healthy food and learn about nutrition.</p>\n<p>“When I was a student the Co-op wasn’t that big of a part of my life, but as I became more invested in food … I saw how the Co-op should be more of a resource for students,” Cohen said. “We’re helping to make it more inclusive, open to everyone, more affordable. It’s less about serving one particular part of our community, more about being open to everyone. Access to healthy food should not be a privilege. It’s a right.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major Gena Sherman said the event opened the public’s eyes to resources available on campus for individuals with eating disorders.</p>\n<p>“I really liked the overall vibe of support that there was,” Sherman said. “I felt like everyone was here for the right reasons.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed Goldenberg’ s quotes to having prior personal experience with eating disorders. Her quote actually pertained to experience with mental health disorders in general, not eating disorders specifically.

director at the American Task Force on Palestine Ghaith al-Omari presented a lecture in Campbell Hall about U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>The talk, titled “U.S. Foreign Policy and the Chaotic Middle East,” traced the history of U.S. and Middle Eastern foreign policies from the Iran war in the 1980s to modern conflicts with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a Sunni fundamentalist group controlling large portions of Northern Iraq. The speakers made points explaining how America has negatively influenced the current state of the Middle East, education in the Middle East and ways to prevent youth from joining ISIL.</p>\n<p>Ginsberg said American policy makers need to take accountability for their mistakes interfering in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“I want to see more American policy makers say that they were dead wrong,” Ginsberg said. “We’ve invested so much with [former Iraqi] Prime Minister al-Maliki. Remember President Obama’s goals, noble goals — we want to get out of Iraq. And yet we turned the keys to a prime minister that was determined to exacerbate the Sunnis, persecute Sunnis as a result of Saddam Hussein and recreate himself as a proxy puppet for the Iranian Wars.”</p>\n<p>According to Ginsberg, the U.S. may not be entirely at fault for the current status of the region but still needs to take responsibility for contributing to the disorder in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“Let’s be very clear here,” Ginsberg said. “The Middle East is a mess. It’s a jungle out there. If we don’t understand when we need to jump into the trees when the elephants are trampling through the jungle in the forest, we have no one to blame but ourselves.”</p>\n<p>Al-Omari said although the U.S. should be held liable, the lack of structure in the Middle East also took part in the rise of disorder.</p>\n<p>“First of all, it is not the U.S.’ fault that these things happen,” al-Omari said. “We have diplomats and intelligence and people on the ground. Of course they know about religion. But we don’t have structures. There’s a bankruptcy of many ideologists of the ’60s faded when Iraq turned into a dictatorship under the guise of pro-western liberals who never really tried to engage. Between Islam and the Iraq revolution, it was only natural Islam would come in and take part.”</p>\n<p>According to Ginsberg, the Obama Administration is not qualified to successfully create effective foreign policy in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“I believe foreign policy is made by people sometimes with good intentions and sometimes by people with good intentions who make mistakes,” Ginsberg said. “My biggest gripe with the Obama’s administration Middle East Policy is that there’s absolutely no one who’s been given authority in this White House who’s been in the Middle East more than two weeks of their lives.”</p>\n<p>Ginsberg said the creation of ISIL can, to a large extent, be directly attributed to the mess that was turned over to former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.</p>\n<p>“This is not the right guy to leave in front of the storm. In some respects, and I don’t enjoy saying this, could there have been an alternative, that could side step the horrible war that is claiming so many lives in such barbaric ways,” Ginsberg said. “We’ve made our share of mistakes by trying to abandon the region and thinking by doing so we can claim victory. We did that in Vietnam and we thought we could get away from it. We are not doing the same in Iraq.”</p>\n<p>Al-Omari said although there is an absence of complex critical thinking on education in the Middle East, innovators should still be given credit for their accomplishments in the brutal conditions they work in.</p>\n<p>“Although there’s a lack of such complex skills, you have to look at what these kids work through — chaos, murder, bloodshed,” al-Omari said. “There is a sheer idea that young Palestinians could work in the incubators in Israel and work in entrepreneurial computer skills that could turn into a huge center of technological enterprise in the Middle East.”</p>\n<p>According to Ginsberg, there is a significant need for critical thinking in Middle Eastern education.</p>\n<p>“I think, in terms of education, if you look at the education at the university level, there is a tremendous lack of critical thinking,” Ginsberg said. “There is a failure to provide critical thinking and skills for the marketplace. Ultimately education is about creating national identity. It is not only lack of educational skills but also lack of critical thinking that will greed into national identity.”</p>\n<p>Ginsberg said a straightforward way to prevent youth from joining ISIL exists, and one method to do so would be to take away their passports.</p>\n<p>“Three perfectly charming young educated women are on their way to Turkey to become, as they say, of the many virgins for ISIS,” Ginsberg said. “The type of person being recruited, what is driving the FBI, CIA and homeland security … there is no one way to prevent this. Parents have to ask themselves — what are their kids watching and do they have a passport? If the kids are watching bad stuff, the first thing they should do is take away their passport.”</p>\n<p>The type of kids who are most vulnerable to being recruited for ISIL are often misfits who are looking for a new adventure in life, according to Ginsberg.</p>\n<p>“They are looking for adventure, the one thing that attracts them is that they think ISIS is winning,” Ginsberg said. “They think they’ll reach a new homeland and set aside barbarity. The recruitment videos they sent out look like they’re at Disneyland!”</p>\n<p>According to al-Omari, the best way to prevent youth from joining ISIL is to try to understand and reach out to them before they are most vulnerable to join.</p>\n<p>“Once they’ve got on a plane, it’s too late,” al-Omari said. “The only thing you can do is arrest them. It’s too far out of our control. What we’re seeing right now is an attempt to start partnerships targeting communities that are the most vulnerable for being recruited and to try and understand those community members. We need to hit it before it gets to that point.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Alex Nguyen said the talk presented him with a new perspective of American foreign policy and American interests in the Middle East, and gave a clearer description of the occurrences in the Middle East and how they affect the U.S.</p>\n<p>“I had never been exposed to something like that on that kind of level in foreign affairs in that kind of detail,” Nguyen said. “It helps frame it a lot better at where the U.S. is at. You see interviews and you see press conferences on this kind of stuff all time and it always seems like it’s thrown around, but this is very condensed and helped me understand it a lot better.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said the event and others similar in nature have allowed him to apply subjects learned in his classes in order to try and solve modern conflicts.</p>\n<p>“Studying political science, you learn these theories of how people and countries work with another, and you put it in the form of what people are trying to see,” Nguyen said. “I think it’s a very healthy thing. We as college students are the minds of the future, and it’s great we’re having these events.

The idea for FTP, which will be the first new party formed since 2010, came from a campus club Morse began in Fall 2013 while a student at Santa Barbara City College (SBCC).</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, FTP aims to preserve the freedoms of individual students.</p>\n<p>“We’re about preserving the basic rights of the students, allowing people who are doing their own thing, minding their own business, to live life,” Garshfield said.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said a major component of the FTP platform will be trimming down the A.S. budget to focus on essential services, stating that the library is an example of misaligned budgetary priorities.</p>\n<p>“It’s going through this three-year renovation and that’s going to be going on almost until I graduate,” Garshfield said. “Before either using taxpayer dollars or student funds on these grand projects, we should be focusing on preserving the rights of the students, and that’s what we’re about.”</p>\n<p>Morse said A.S. should not impose funds through lock-in fees, especially considering the low election turnout during fee initiative elections. According to him, FTP will instead give students the option to pay for activities and services separately.</p>\n<p>“You’re voting with your dollar at that point,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Official People’s Party (OPP) Chair and fourth-year political science major Elijah Ettenger said in a statement that eliminating lock-in fees is not the solution to increase fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<p>“We feel the solution is instead to have a more strict process for the enactment of new lock-in fees so that only the most critical are approved,” Ettenger said.</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, one of FTP’s main concerns is “police occupation” in Isla Vista, and he criticized OPP for not addressing this alleged issue.</p>\n<p>“We’re very concerned about the police occupation,” Garshfield said. “The fact that our only elected representatives haven’t been dealing with it is something we definitely feel needs to be corrected.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said while he believes FTP’s goal to address police behavior will be “fairly noncontroversial” among students, the party’s views on how to address the issue may face opposition.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the students are fed up with the police presence,” Garshfield said. “So that at least is something a lot of students will get behind. What I think might be controversial is that we’re willing to choose freedom over safety … There are some people who believe that without the increased police presence, we are not going to be able to maintain order.”</p>\n<p>Morse said A.S. should view police relations through a framework of “community-based solutions.”</p>\n<p>“I think that there are definitely ways that we can self-regulate,” Morse said, “We don’t need this sort of martial law.”</p>\n<p>According to Ettenger however, OPP has already taken steps toward improving community and police relations.</p>\n<p>“In order to achieve this we must first bring everyone to the table,” Ettenger stated. “OPP has already begun this process by organizing programs such as Pizza with Police and Coffee with the Cops.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Foot Patrol Lieutenant Robert Plastino said he agrees that there needs to be increased efforts made to improve police relations with the student community.</p>\n<p>“Positions like a Community Resource Deputy are sorely needed in Isla Vista, yet budget and staffing issues prevent such outreach,” Plastino said in an email.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said the process he underwent to register FTP as an official party was unnecessarily complicated and could potentially discourage other student political participation.</p>\n<p>“There’s also this very complex set of rules and regulations, and I think a lot of it is designed to stop ordinary students from getting involved,” Garshfield said. “That’s something that’s concerning to me and I’d like to see the elections code made … a little simpler for students to get involved with.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science, black studies major and former Democratic Process (DP) party candidate Mohsin Mirza said he agrees the process involves many barriers. According to him, the DP party has not announced any candidates for the upcoming election.</p>\n<p>“The process is difficult, but more than just rules and regulations,” Mirza said. “If you don’t have the money, if you don’t have the time, if you’re a working-class student — it’s very difficult to be in those positions.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Chair and second-year political science major Fiona Hayman however said starting a political party is a very accessible process for students.</p>\n<p>“Anyone can start their own party if they fill out the necessary form and appoint a party liaison, who will be the point of communication between the party and the Elections Committee,” Hayman said. “I see this as beneficial for the UCSB community, as the accessibility of the processes of forming a party and running for office is essential to the efficacy of democracy.</p>\n<p>Morse said he and Garshfield decided to register a party for this spring’s election in part to ensure there is a party to compete against OPP.</p>\n<p>“It seems like the OPP party is the only one that is running, so we thought that it was important just to have a competition of different ideas,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he is worried OPP is gaining complete control of the campus’ political conversations.</p>\n<p>“Over time, I’m worried that it will become more and more of a political machine that simply turns out candidates for the sake of winning,” Garshfield said. “Someone needs to challenge the status quo, and we were the ones to stand up and do it.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, multi-sided political party competition is important to represent the variety of student voices that exist on campus.</p>\n<p>“I believe we need to have multiple parties,” Mirza said. “The fact that there’s just two parties I think is a failure, because I think students think in more than two different ways.”</p>\n<p>But Ettenger said OPP is committed to representing each and every student on campus.</p>\n<p>“Every year our party brings together a diversified group of students that provide a consistent influx of new and innovative ideas to best represent all students,” Ettenger said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to Morse, FTP has gathered support and would like to run more candidates in the upcoming A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“We’ve found some other people who are interested in running with us,” Morse said. “Generally, we have gained a lot of support.”</p>\n<p>Morse said while FTP’s conservative ideas may face challenges, he hopes the party will be seen as a vehicle for representing common student interests.</p>\n<p>“The Free Thinking Patriots is not about representing one party as a whole,” Morse said. “Its specific mandate is to rise above that and come up with common ground solutions.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, the rising cost of education makes collective funding for student groups vital in order to ensure student empowerment and diversity.</p>\n<p>“At a time when education is so expensive, we need well-funded organizations advocating for us,” Mirza said. “The idea of having students pay for things themselves, out of pocket, undermines the idea that we are stronger when we act together and pull all our resources together.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he runs the A.S. Lobby Corps, which uses A.S. funding to take students to Sacramento to meet with California legislators and lobby on student-related issue like affordability of education. Mirza said he thus feels A.S. funding for particular student activities is important.</p>\n<p>“That money is used for very important things that help students,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Mirza also said the A.S. budget could be made more efficient without having to reduce collective student funding.</p>\n<p>“Do I think that we could be doing more with the resources we have? Yes,” Mirza said. “But I think it’s absurd to say the solution is to weaken our own power by taking away our ability to fund ourselves and our projects.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, although he does not “think that it’s a secret that [he is] a conservative,” he said he hopes FTP will be seen as a vehicle for representing common student interests, not as a platform for his and Garshfield’s politics.</p>\n<p>“The Free Thinking Patriots is not about representing one party as a whole,” Morse said. “Its specific mandate is to rise above that and come up with common ground solutions.”</p>\n<p>While Garshfield called FTP an “underdog,” he said believes in its ideals and is ready to compete with OPP.</p>\n<p>“If I didn’t believe in shooting high I wouldn’t be doing this,” Garshfield said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61277\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/students-form-new-campus-party/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61277\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/students-form-new-campus-party/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/students-form-new-campus-party/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/students-form-new-campus-party/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/students-form-new-campus-party/","id":2888,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2887,2886,2885],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Clippers: Recovery Possible, As Usual, After a Bad Start","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"No matter how many games they lose, coaches they fire, first round flops they pick and players in their prime they let go, the Clippers never let you down.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>This column appeared in the Daily Nexus under the header “He Said, He Said: The L.A.

You hold your breath after every mild success, ever number-one draft pick and every two-game winning streak — waiting for something to go wrong, waiting for them to fuck it up. Then you bitch about it once they inevitably do. </p>\n<p>That’s what it means to be a Clippers fan.</p>\n<p>Still, I sit here after the Clippers have fallen to 1-6, fully prepared to talk about why this is the year everything changes. For the Clippers, 1-6 is the new 1-2. It’s a disappointing start, but they can still recover.</p>\n<p>There’s some pride involved with loving a team so shitty they only sell out games when the Lakers are playing them. We’re a distinct bunch, Clipper fans. We’re used to empty arenas, cheap tickets, waiting until the end of a SportsCenter broadcast for highlights that never come.</p>\n<p>When I showed these first few paragraphs to the Artsweek guy, the dude who wrote about Miami’s pending dominance last week, he said nothing helpful, walked back over to his office and yelled back, “Who cares?”</p>\n<p>Before that, I told the Opinion girl about what I was about to write and she said, “Really? Why?” with one of those looks that hot girls give to short ugly guys with no money who try to hit on them. Then she talked about how well the Lakers played this weekend, just like everybody does.</p>\n<p>I’ve been going to Clippers games since I was six. I remember feeling sorry for Brent Barry, who would stand in a corner outside the Clippers’ locker room at the Sports Arena in silence while all the kids would crowd around Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill and young Kobe. I remember sitting right above the Clippers bench when Michael Jordan, in the legendary black Bulls jersey with the pinstripes, dropped 49 in 1998 to beat us in double overtime.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, I was home watching the Clippers’ road loss to the Jazz. The Clips were up by 18 at one point. Three quarters later they were only up by seven. Then they were tied. Then they were down by seven. Blake Griffin fouled out with two minutes left. As usual, it looked like it was all over.</p>\n<p>Then the Clippers went on a run, as usual. Eric Gordon started shitting all over everybody. With eight seconds left in regulation, he crossed over two dudes and dunked on two others, tying the game and sending it into overtime. I jumped and yelled and ran around the family room. My little sister rolled her eyes and resumed watching Mary Poppins on her stupid little DVD player.</p>\n<p>Two overtimes later, they lost anyway. Now they’re 1-6 instead of 2-5. I haven’t compiled the stats, but I can almost guarantee the Clippers have been on the losing end of overtime games more than any other NBA team.</p>\n<p>There’s always hope with the Clippers, and the Clippers always take that hope away and leave you longing for that hope all over again. They’re an addiction.</p>\n<p>Once they’re that .500 team that inches their way into the playoffs, which they will be, I’ll be there. Then I’ll be there when they lose, and when they trade Griffin away for a first round pick in 2013.
