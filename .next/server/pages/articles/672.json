Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB picked up the subregional championship in the Progressive Legends Classic Tournament with an 80-73 victory over Montana on Tuesday. This win marked the first time since March 2016 that the Gauchos have won consecutive games, and technically gave UCSB a 5th place finish in the opening tourney. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Grizzlies dropped to 3-2 as a result of the loss while the Gauchos pushed back through the .500 barrier and now sit at 3-2 as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB employed a balanced attack to start the game off. Four different players scored in the first five minutes for the Gauchos, and they quickly ran up a double digit lead. Their offense to start seemed like a testament to the heavy focus on ball movement that Coach Pasternack brought to the team as they consistently passed up good shots for great ones, something they hadn’t been doing in their prior losses.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The engine for the Gauchos offense was definitely Leland King II in the first half. The forward had his third 20 point game of the year, and is playing some of the best basketball of his career right now. He had ten points and four rebounds in the half, and was hounding the Grizzlies on the defensive end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This game showcased how much value he has just by his ability to stretch the floor. The graduate transfer went 2-4 from behind the arc, and while the amount might not sound that impressive, his accuracy from three forces defenders to respect his shot and creates huge lanes for the Gauchos to take advantage of. He finished with 20 points on 6-9 shooting, but he brings so much more to the offensive end than box score stats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other graduate transfer, Marcus Jackson, showed his versatility on the offensive end in his second game back from a hip injury. His playmaking ability was on full display in the first half, as he led the team in assists. The guard had a couple key sequences in the first half that helped push the lead up for the Gauchos, including a big block which led to a bucket by Max Heidegger that put them up by 18 with ten minutes left in the half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB took an 11 point lead into halftime, but were quickly blindsided by a Grizzly run led by forward Jamar Akoh. The transfer from Cal State Fullerton revived Montana, getting a jump-shot and steal within the first two minutes, starting a wave of momentum that would end with them actually taking the lead about halfway in. He scored all of his 12 points in the second half, and would have been a hero had the Gauchos not had an offensive igniter of their own in Max Heidegger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a semi-quiet first half by the sophomore guard’s high standards (he “only” scored 8 points), Heidegger exploded for 18 points in the second. He went 4-6 from deep and made 10 field goals in just the second half alone, more than any other player made in the entire game. Heidegger closed out the game with 8 straight points, putting it out of reach for Montana and securing the win for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, UCSB returns to the Thunderdome on Friday to take on Prairie View A&amp;M (1-3). The Panthers come into this matchup fresh off their first victory over Eastern Kentucky, but have lost by double digits in their other three games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are going to have to keep an eye on forward Zachary Hamilton, who’s averaging near 18 points and 4 rebounds a game this year. It will be another challenge for Jalen Canty and King II down low, although they have responded great to almost any player thrown their way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focusing on the fundamentals is going to be essential for the Gauchos in this matchup, which they did a great job of in the last game against Montana. If they maintain the high free throw shooting percentage they had against the Grizzlies (80%), and limit turnovers, it should be a triumphant return home for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and Prairie View tip off at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 24.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Any time you win on the road, you have to be satisfied with that even though we know it wasn’t a pretty 40 minutes.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB took advantage from the high post, breaking down Davis’ trapping defense. Senior forward Sweets Underwood and senior guard Angelei Aguirre both played the elbow spot, combining for 27 points.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of our hits were in the high post and that’s something that we really worked on — that high-post shot, whether it was high low or short corner — the ball has to go in and out and I think we did an awesome job rotating the ball in and out,” Underwood said. “That’s how Lei and I were able to get some open looks.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started the game hot on the offensive end, using 66.7 percent shooting to put together a 13-4 run and take an early 23-12 lead.</p>\n<p>“I think we just executed offensively, which got us open shots,” Aguirre said. “We were able to take our time and knock them down.”</p>\n<p>However, the Aggies returned the favor as they went on an 8-0 run of their own to get within three points. That’s when UCSB picked up its defense, which sparked a 6-0 run as the Gauchos finished the half with a 31-24 lead.</p>\n<p>Playing well from the opening tip has been a crucial key for Santa Barbara as the team is now 9-1 when leading at the half.</p>\n<p>“You always want to go into halftime feeling good about yourselves and then come out with even more energy, so that first half lead was very critical for us,” Underwood said.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker rooms, sophomore forward Sydnee Fipps found her stride offensively, scoring 10 of the Aggies first 14 points of the half to get her team back in the game. Fipps finished with a game-high 16 points.</p>\n<p>“[Fipps is] a great player,” Mitchell said. “She has an attack mentality and we have to do a better job of guarding off the dribble.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also suffered from a six-minute scoring drought in the middle of the second half, caused by unforced turnovers, allowing the Aggies to go on a 9-2 run and close the gap to one point at 44-43. On the night, UCSB turned the ball over 22 times compared to 16 for Davis.</p>\n<p>“We made a lot of critical mistakes offensively, turning the ball over, when we didn’t need to,” Underwood said. “They executed off of our turnovers, so it was us beating up on ourselves.”</p>\n<p>The game remained close throughout the rest of the half and Davis once again cut the lead to one with 2:58 remaining.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB persevered. Senior center Kirsten Tilleman knocked down two free throws to make the score 54-51 with just over a minute to go. Out of a timeout, Davis managed to get off a three-point shot, but UCSB was able to earn the stop, allowing junior guard Nicole Nesbit to ice the game at the free throw line hitting both attempts.</p>\n<p>“We just focused on defense,” Aguirre said. “They’re a systems team, so we knew what they’re running, and so we just had to focus and not make any mental mistakes.”</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara outrebounded the Aggies 34-24 and outshot Davis 47.8 percent to 34.7 percent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had extremely balanced scoring on the night as well with three players finishing in double figures. Nesbit tallied 13 points and five assists on the night while Aguirre contributed 12 points and five rebounds.</p>\n<p>Underwood led the Gauchos with 15 points and 12 rebounds for her eighth double-double of the season. Finally, Tilleman posted a solid night, finishing with eight points and seven boards, and junior guard Melissa Zornig scored eight points, including two critical threes down the stretch.</p>\n<p>“I was proud of our team that we were able to buckle down and win a close game and be able to execute and hit shots and most importantly, get stops when it counted,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its road trip north against Big West leader Pacific this Saturday.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the February 8th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/gauchos-back-to-winning-ways/","id":669,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[668,667,666],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cold Gauchos Fall to Sharpshooting Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The shots weren’t falling for the UCSB men’s basketball team last night as the Gauchos dropped a 64-56 game to UC Davis that extended Santa Barbara’s season long losing streak to five games.

Overall, UCSB shot 34.9 percent from the field last night.</p>\n<p>“We got good shots up there, they just weren’t falling tonight,” freshman guard Michael Bryson said. “There were times when people were right open and not able to knock it down. We’re going to have bad shooting nights, but we can’t blame the game on just the shooting. [Davis] shot lights out and we can’t let that happen.”</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara came out cold, Davis was on fire from the start, shooting nearly 49 percent from the field on the night. In the first half, the Aggies were shooting above 50 percent from both the field and behind the three.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Corey Hawkins, the Big West leading scorer, led all players with 20 points on the night while registering a team high nine rebounds. Junior guard Ryan Sypkens added 15 points while sophomore forward J.T. Adenrele scored 10 for Davis.</p>\n<p>“We’re not playing together as a group, as a team right now,” sophomore center Alan Williams said. “It wasn’t close by any stretch of the imagination tonight. They completely dominated us.”</p>\n<p>Big Al, who was playing in only his second game since returning from injury, registered team highs with 15 points and 13 rebounds for his 10th double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Bryson scored 13 points for UCSB but was 1-8 on three-point shots. He, along with freshman forward Taran Brown, pulled down eight rebounds for a Gauchos squad that fell behind 34-22 at the half.</p>\n<p>“I’m surprised we were so bad offensively that first half,” Coach Williams said. “We got frustrated, rattled by the physicalness of the game, rattled by just how they came at us. I don’t think we ever played offensively very well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now shift their focus to Saturday night’s game against Pacific, which fell 67-62 against Cal Poly last night. Despite the loss, the Tigers sit in second place in the Big West with a 13-9 overall record and 7-3 mark in conference play.</p>\n<p>“I can’t see this basketball team beating Pacific without hitting threes,” Coach Williams said. “We’re going to have to just keep grinding and shoot the ball better.”</p>\n<p>With 10 teams in the Big West this season, only the top eight will advance to the conference tournament. Now with only seven conference games remaining, UCSB must win immediately if it wants to play well into March.</p>\n<p>“We’ve just got to come together and figure it out and win some games,” Big Al said. “It’s not about X’s and O’s or anything like that, it’s about our heart and our determination and our pride in going out there and representing UCSB basketball in the best way we can, and right now, we’re not doing that.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Saturday night’s game is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the February 8th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/","id":670,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[669,668,667],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Make Epic Comeback to Bring Streak to Three","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team went into Stockton as the clear underdog.

UCSB now stands at 11-12 overall and 7-4 in conference while the Tigers lost their second-straight game, dropping to 8-3 in league and 18-5 overall.</p>\n<p>“I’m extremely proud — coming back from the deficit,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We made the right decisions and we made big stops. As a coach, you just have to smile because it’s starting to come together.”</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the Gauchos won the game on the defensive end. UCSB held Pacific, which leads the Big West in scoring at 71.5 points per game, to 24.5 points below its average.</p>\n<p>“[Defense is] our team identity,” Underwood said. “People were at the right places at the right time, we had good rotation, help side was there, and we took a couple charges.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also limited the Tiger’s three point shooting, allowing them to shoot just 21.7 percent from behind the arc, a much lower percentage than their leage-leading 34.7 percent average.</p>\n<p>“What we did is we had four players in the lane and one player on the ball,” Mitchell said. “That was our strategy, to clog the lanes because last time it was a layup drill on us and we didn’t want to go down that way today.”</p>\n<p>Down 10 halfway through the second half, junior guard Melissa Zornig converted a layup that sparked a 16-2 run that gave the Gauchos a 46-42 lead with 2:36 remaining.</p>\n<p>“Our kids just started playing with a lot of confidence,” Mitchell said. “I think once they adjusted to the tempo of the game, we settled in. Sometimes when you’re backed into a corner, you come out fighting and that’s what we did in the second half.”</p>\n<p>However, the very next play, UCSB gave up two offensive rebounds, resulting in a put-back by senior forward Ashley Smith. Then, senior forward Kendall Rodriguez buried a three to regain a one-point lead for Pacific.</p>\n<p>Down a point with just under a minute left and in need of a basket, senior center Kirsten Tilleman received the ball on the wing and fed the ball in to Underwood, who went up for the short jump shot and was fouled. Underwood knocked down both free throws to give UCSB a 48-47 lead.</p>\n<p>“That was an [isolation play],” Underwood said. “We were trying to get to the rim, finish or get a foul. They ended up fouling me, so that was awesome.”</p>\n<p>With their tenacious ‘D,’ the Gauchos earned a stop on the opposite end, forcing Pacific to foul junior guard Nicole Nesbit with 18 seconds left on the game clock. UCSB’s best free-throw shooter stepped up to the line and calmly sank both free throws to give UCSB a 50-47 advantage.</p>\n<p>With one offensive possession remaining for the Tigers, the Big West’s best offensive team was set to take on the conference’s best defensive squad. Rodriguez lined up a triple but Tilleman swatted the shot away, forcing Pacific to throw up a long fade away three.</p>\n<p>“During that last timeout, we had seen that play (during the film of the Cal Poly vs. Pacific game) and we knew they were going to go to it,” Mitchell said. “We handled the ball side of the three for [senior guard Erica McKenzie] and we had players that made plays.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara secured the rebound and Nesbit was able to clinch the game at the free throw line. Overall, the Gauchos shot 94.1 percent from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB found its stride in the second half, outshooting Pacific 40 percent to 31 percent. In addition, after 10 first half turnovers, Santa Barbara gave the ball away just three times in the second half.</p>\n<p>The offense was balanced, too, as the Gauchos featured three players in double-figures. Zornig led all scorers with 18 points including 3-5 from behind the arc, while Nesbit scored 13 points, 11 coming in the second half. Underwood tallied her ninth double-double of the season with 14 points, 10 of which came in the second half, and a career-high 16 rebounds. Finally, Tilleman added six points, eight rebounds, two blocks and a career-high tying four steals.</p>\n<p>“We definitely came in here as the underdog, expected to lose and we came in here fired up and ready to win,” Zornig said.</p>\n<p>To begin the game, UCSB struggled offensively, missing its first seven shots. Shooting just 23.1 percent, it looked as if there was a cover on the rim and the Gauchos quickly fell into a 24-11 hole. Nevertheless, Santa Barbara ended the half on a 7-2 run to go into the locker room down just single digits, 26-18.</p>\n<p>“It was really frustrating because we’re getting open looks, but we couldn’t hit any shots,” Zornig said. “We just had to stay confident. We knew we were going to hit shots in the second half.”</p>\n<p>Zornig single-handedly kept UCSB in the game during the first half, scoring 10 of the team’s 18 first half total.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig] has a knack for scoring,” Mitchell said. “She has great moves around the basket and we all know she can knock it down.”</p>\n<p>Pacific was relentless to open the second half though, going on a 7-1 run in the first three minutes of play. However, the Gauchos stole the momentum and would eventually outscore the Tigers 34-21 in the second half.</p>\n<p>“We had some huge stops at the end,” Zornig said. “Our shot was off at the beginning of the game, but we found a way to knock down some shots at some critical moments.”</p>\n<p>After two games up on the road, UCSB returns home for a three-game home stand beginning next Saturday against Cal Poly for the Play for Kay game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50132\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-make-epic-comeback-to-bring-streak-to-three/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50132\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-make-epic-comeback-to-bring-streak-to-three/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-make-epic-comeback-to-bring-streak-to-three/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-make-epic-comeback-to-bring-streak-to-three/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-make-epic-comeback-to-bring-streak-to-three/","id":671,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[670,669,668],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
