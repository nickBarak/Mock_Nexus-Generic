The whole Exercise and Sports Studies program, including the classes and the minor, were cut after the school dropped $45 million from its budget at the end of the 2009 fiscal year.</p>\n<p>I don’t proclaim to have any idea how funding for such a program really works, but if the result is no more exercise courses will be available to UCSB students, then it’s an awful way to spend money.</p>\n<p>UCSB has some really nice facilities available to everyone, a wonderful staff and a lot of kids who need to start going to the gym. People should expect their university environment to come with a whole range of ways to improve themselves, and that includes the physical side too.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>There exists a certain stereotypical image of an intelligent, successful person a school like ours churns out. He or she can rattle off equations or quote classics and has poured over textbooks in the library for four solid years. That model works for a lot of people, but not everyone.</p>\n<p>Education should not be confined to the mind. A big part of a happy or successful existence for many of us includes physical activity. While we’re here, the goal is to evolve a bit into more responsible, ready-for-real-life adults, and that’s why it is UCSB’s responsibility to provide physical education for all of us in addition to the classrooms and exams.</p>\n<p>Going back to my personal experience (I had to talk about myself at some point, right?), I have been a much happier person while leading a somewhat active lifestyle. Of course, many other factors in my life contribute to that happiness, but ESS, when I go, is basically a guarantee of a pretty good day.</p>\n<p>After exercising, I go home, shower, eat something and feel like I’m ready to get things done. Even if my muscles are a little sore and I’m physically tired, it never affects schoolwork, when I do it of course. In fact, it’s just the opposite. Playing a few sets of tennis or anything else stimulates my mind and improves my mood a ton. Something about endorphins, or something.</p>\n<p>I challenge you to ask yourself what class you went to last that made you feel better rather than exhausted. If the response is your 14-hour chem lab every Thursday night, then maybe the academics-driven lifestyle I talked about earlier is for you. That’s wonderful. We need people in those great white lab coats anyway.</p>\n<p>But if your answer is the same “umm… nothing” that I would have given last quarter, maybe it’s time to look somewhere else, and ESS is a great place to start. They offer a fucking sailing class for God’s sake! I know you have your second pass time coming up soon, so take up another half unit. It’s pass/no pass and, in my experience, they’re easy to crash.</p>\n<p>After four years of college, I’m starting to see why older people are always telling me to enjoy my time in college, to do every activity I can sign up for. It goes by fast, and I highly suggest you find room in between booty calls and film screenings to pick up a sport or two, even if you suck. ESS is going to be gone very soon so find a class now, because it’s the last chance you’re going to get, and that’s a shame. It’s the perfect way to guarantee a good day, and if you ask me, that’s pretty special.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/train-sports-editor-week-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/train-sports-editor-week-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/train-sports-editor-week-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/train-sports-editor-week-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/train-sports-editor-week-2/","id":2998,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[2997,2996,2995],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard","biography":"Not available","articles":[166,271,297,429,431,451,890,891,921,1297,1701,1702,1704,1705,1706,1708,1709,1710,1712,1714,1715,1716,1717,1720,1722,1723,1725,1726,1727,1728,1729,1730,1732,1733,1739,1740,1741,1744,1753,1755,1756,1760,2147,2150,2163,2807,2898,2905,2915,2918,2998,3172,4535,4548,5495],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Senate meeting included debate on a bill that would change the responsibilities of the Student Advocate General, a visit from UCPD’s Lt. Mark Signa and a speaker on the place of art in Isla Vista. <em>Alex Yam/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met last night in the Flying A room in the UCen to discuss issues including the proposed “Bill to Re-Envision the Office of the Student Advocate General” and heard questions regarding police policies for this upcoming Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>The proposed “Bill to Re-Envision the Office of the Student Advocate General” seeks to create a new advocacy unit to deal with individual students’ needs, a service the SAG currently performs. UCSB Police Department Lt. Mark Signa also answered questions from senators about police policies in I.V. this Halloween, including restrictions on vehicle traffic.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year sociology and psychology double major and A.S. President Ali Guthy, the bill would remove the casework aspects of the work done by SAG.</p>\n<p>“The bill is a structural change,” Guthy said. “It has no effect on the SAG’s ability to select their staff, it just removes their casework component.”</p>\n<p>Guthy defended the proposal and cited the A.S. Legal Code as a reason for separating the casework and outreach responsibilities of the SAG.</p>\n<p>“The constitution does not demand that the SAG perform casework,” Guthy said. “They’re supposed to educate the student body on these resources, and then they’re also doing casework, which is not listed in the constitution.”</p>\n<p>Former Student Advocate General and third-year CCS literature major Bailey Loverin, who was elected last Spring and abdicated the position in early September, said that SAG workers’ viewpoints should be considered and discussed as well as the possible issues with forming a new advocacy unit. Loverin said those present lacked any experience in the position of SAG and raised concerns about maintaining confidentiality in the proposed new unit.</p>\n<p>“I think it is ridiculous that this is even being considered,” Loverin said. “Did you know that anyone entering that office [as SAG] has to sign a non-disclosure agreement worth half a million dollars to maintain confidentiality? That becomes a huge risk when you have a unit doing this. How are you going to maintain confidentiality?”</p>\n<p>The bill will be discussed further in future meetings and a senate vote has not yet been held.</p>\n<p>Signa was present at the senate meeting as a representative of the UCPD and discussed police policies for the upcoming Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>A.S. Off-Campus Senator Michelle Moreh asked whether or not identification would be required to enter I.V. this weekend.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen a sign near campus saying you may need to provide proof of residency to be able to come into Isla Vista during a certain time period…” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>Signa said no such policies would be in place this weekend. According to Signa, the only areas facing restrictions on vehicle traffic will be the 6500, 6700 and 6800 blocks of Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road.</p>\n<p>Signa also said the police strategy to maintain peace this weekend includes an effort to keep crowds moving to prevent tensions from rising and fights from breaking out.</p>\n<p>“The goal is not to go out there and write a lot of tickets. The goal is to keep the streets going and moving back and forth,” Signa said. “When the crowd stops there’s a serious concern there that the crowd will bunch up and when people get really crowded in there, they’ve been tense, they’ve been intoxicated, they get aggressive and fights start breaking out. That’s the same reason we don’t want cars on Del Playa.”</p>\n<p>According to Signa, he enjoys working in the community, although certain segments make his job more difficult.</p>\n<p>“I love working here, I love Isla Vista, I love the community, I love the university,” Signa said. “The struggle with Isla Vista is you have such a diverse population and I don’t want to point fingers at any group but City College unfortunately has a reputation of having a lot of kids there for partying. If that’s their only goal, it’s hard to change that.”</p>\n<p>Professor Kim Yasuda from the art dept. also spoke briefly to the senate about recent public art demonstrations in I.V. and the importance of developing I.V. as an artistic community.</p>\n<p>“I really feel like Isla Vista is ripe for a creative incubator where students could engage in projects,” Yasuda said.</p>\n<p>Yasuda said I.V. could be made safer not only by increasing security, but also increasing public art. As an example, Yasuda broached the possibility of public lighting in the form of art installations.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I want to say is enforcement is certainly important for safety, but there’s also engagement, and I think the arts could bring the engagement piece in partnership with the enforcement piece to bring a really safe environment,” Yasuda said. “Public lighting doesn’t have to be security lights or surveillance cameras; It can be beautiful, magical lighting.”</p>\n<p>A.S.

You can’t teach parkour.”</p>\n<p>With a background in martial arts, Doyle became a professional parkour athlete at age 18. In 2007, he won the first international parkour competition, the Red Bull Art of Motion in Austria.</p>\n<p>“I guess parkour started in Europe, but that’s just a name. People have been free running and jumping on stuff for years,” Doyle said. “Just look at Jackie Chan. It has been around forever. The French just commercialized it.”</p>\n<p>Doyle currently designs parkour courses with Red Bull to improve competitions. After flipping around university campuses along the California coast, he will head to Hawaii to create a course amongst the trees hanging over sandy beaches.</p>\n<p>“There’s only a handful of guys who are doing this professionally and we all come from different sports,” Doyle said. “We’re not judging the contestants really anymore. We’re judging the course for which style suits it best.”</p>\n<p>With nearly 2.5 million views on his official YouTube channel, Doyle’s aerial tricks and acrobatic parkour moves have become Internet sensations. His 44 official uploads can be found at www.youtube.com/user/10055870.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

id=\"caption-attachment-85778\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The event, sponsored by the UC Santa Barbara’s Arts &amp; Lectures series, invited Albright to speak about her experience as Secretary of State and her take on foreign policy, among other things.</p>\n<p>Albright explained that her father faced roadblocks seeking political asylum in the U.S. during the McCarthy Era, as he had to explain that the government he once worked under was openly communist. This extreme governmental scrutiny delayed a young Albright’s path to citizenship until the summer between her sophomore and junior years at Wellesley College.</p>\n<p>Albright expressed the importance of written immigration policy –– an issue that currently divides the executive and legislative branches in a record-breaking government shutdown.</p>\n<p>“We could be more generous in our laws…We have a lot of room [in the country],” she said to a room of thunderous applause.</p>\n<p>She expressed support and empathy for those supported by the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act (DREAMers), noting that the bartering of their livelihoods are a “particularly sad aspect” of the immigration crisis.</p>\n<p>“We have a policy toward refugees that would make the Statue of Liberty weep,” she said during the speech.</p>\n<p>Albright also praised UC Santa Barbara for being one of the first universities to offer a Global Studies major. Though she expressed her concerns for the current state of American foreign policy –– and emphasized that the rest of the world would not wait for the United States to get its act together –– she remained optimistic that students at the university would learn to think beyond stereotypes and borders.</p>\n<p>Albright praised students who opted to study abroad or those whose majors contain an emphasis on the relationship between culture and ethics.</p>\n<p>“Seeds nourished in a multicultural classroom have a way of blossoming… This is a key to real leadership.”</p>\n<p>A common theme in Albright’s talk was a sense of prevailing hope for the future. Citing a round-table discussion earlier in the day with members of the UCSB Letters &amp; Science Honors Program, she spoke with delight about the ferocity of the students she had conversed with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“We have a policy toward refugees that would make the Statue of Liberty weep.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She cited weakness at the core of the political system, not only with the downfall of the American presidency, but with the disastrous Brexit deal as well. The fall of democracy, she claimed, allows fascism to creep its way back into the public eye.</p>\n<p>“As the world’s democracies dither, [nationalist movements] scale the ramparts,” she said, referencing rising totalitarian states like Russia, Syria, Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>\n<p>This rising hyper-nationalism is caused by a combination of globalization and technology, Albright added: “[These trends] are double-edged swords.”</p>\n<p>The issue with globalization, she said, is that it is faceless. She views technology as a more difficult issue to unpack, as she believes it has caused much beneficial change, but also noted that it has put so many skilled laborers out of work.</p>\n<p>Social media combines these two factors, and in the hands of demagogues, becomes a tool of unwieldy fascism, Albright said. She claims social media “allows demagogues to build bonfires” out of hatred, and with the technological advancements of a worldwide platform, the spread of fascism has become that much simpler.</p>\n<p>When asked by moderator Jeff Greenfield how she explains the behavior of President Trump to foreigners, Albright became visibly restrained.</p>\n<p>“I find it very, very painful…There is no logic. It is confusing to our allies as well as our adversaries.”</p>\n<p>Yet, Albright wholeheartedly encouraged people to run for office and to engage in dialogues across the aisle.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like the word tolerance,” she said, claiming instead that she is partial to its friendlier counterpart ‘respect.’</p>\n<p>She referenced her morning commute to Georgetown University, driving through the streets of Washington, D.C. as she listens to right wing radio.

She agreed that Albright was far more restrained during her prepared remarks.</p>\n<p>“You can tell that she genuinely feels passion for the United States,” Wiley added.</p>\n<p>Not all were happy with Albright’s visit to the Granada, however. A handful of protestors — including approximately 20 members of the Student Activist Network and the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective — stood outside the building during Albright’s speech chanting, “Whose streets?” “Our streets!” and “Whose blood?” “Albright’s blood!”</p>\n<p>Protesters held signs with slogans such as: “Albright gave the green light for the Rwandan Genocide” and “No war mongers in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>In a statement referring to Albright as “a neo-imperialist hawk widely accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity,” the Student Activist Network encouraged UCSB to “redirect its resources to public figures committed to transforming the unjust and untenable political and economic order that Former Secretary of State Albright exemplifies.”</p>\n<p>“The fact that she has written a book about resisting fascism is incredibly ironic because she paved the way for the rise of fascism in this country and in many other countries that the United States supported during her time in office,” Prathik Raghu, one of the organizers of the protest, said.</p>\n<p>Though Raghu, a teaching assistant within the UCSB Global Studies Department, sees Albright as an adversary to President Trump, this does not mean that this exonerates her from “having blood on her hands.”</p>\n<p><em>Hannah Jackson is an asst. opinion editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at opinion@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 24, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
