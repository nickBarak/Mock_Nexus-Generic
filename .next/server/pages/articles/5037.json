Senior Austin Kingi was the only player to top Marsh’s numbers this weekend, with a team-high 13 kills on Friday.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Rick McLaughlin was particularly impressed with how his team coped without Delson along with a couple other minor injuries in the last two matches.</p>\n<p>“We prepared well this past week and it showed in the two matches against Hawaii. A few guys have been pretty banged up but they are hanging that well and doing what it takes to find a way to compete.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be hoping Delson has a speedy recovery going into the last week of the regular season, with the team already clinching its spot in the MPSF conference tournament.</p>\n<p>“It’s really great to see the team come together and get wins while I can’t help on the court,” Delson said. “And I’m hoping to be back by Stanford, but being healthy by playoffs is the biggest goal I’ve set.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara played with an evenly balanced attack this weekend, getting its middle blockers highly involved in both contests. Senior Ryan Hardy and redshirt freshman Henri Cherry, who together totaled 20 kills Friday and 14 Saturday, managed to make helpful contributions on the offensive end despite splitting playing time.</p>\n<p>The Hawaii matches were also two of UCSB’s cleanest of the year, in which the team averaged 3.0 errors per set, well below their season average of 5.44. The Gauchos put plenty of pressure on the Warriors too, forcing the visitors to 24 errors in the first meeting, followed by 21 in the next match.</p>\n<p>“We served pretty well, but the biggest thing was the small amount of errors we made in general,” Delson said of his team’s weekend performance.</p>\n<p>The consistency shown in the last three games are just what Head Coach Rick McLaughlin has been preaching to his players all season, and the team believes it’s reaching the point it must be at in pursuit of a potential deep postseason run.</p>\n<p>“Whenever you start getting wins at the end of the season, it means we’re peaking at the right time,” Delson said.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos are two of the toughest matches of their season as they host No. 6 Pepperdine Wednesday, April 6 at 7 p.m. in Rob Gym. In its final match of the regular season, UCSB will host No. 4 Stanford on Saturday, April 9 at 7 p.m. in Rob Gym.</p>\n<p>In their last meeting with each team, the Gauchos knocked off Pepperdine in five sets on the road, but lost in straight sets to Stanford. Allowing just two losses in home matches this season, UCSB will attempt to capitalize on its three-match win streak as it prepares for the last week of MPSF play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-7-ucsb-peaking-earn-back-to-back-victories-over-no-8-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-7-ucsb-peaking-earn-back-to-back-victories-over-no-8-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-7-ucsb-peaking-earn-back-to-back-victories-over-no-8-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-7-ucsb-peaking-earn-back-to-back-victories-over-no-8-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-7-ucsb-peaking-earn-back-to-back-victories-over-no-8-hawaii/","id":5037,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5036,5035,5034],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns","biography":"Not available","articles":[1401,1404,1408,1409,1412,1413,1414,1416,1417,1418,1420,1422,1424,1427,1429,1432,1433,1435,1438,1439,1440,1446,1453,1454,1456,1458,1491,1492,1493,1904,1916,1929,1972,3308,3321,3335,4837,5028,5029,5031,5033,5034,5035,5036,5037,5038,5039,5040,5043,5045,5050,5052,5053,5054,5056,5057,5058,5059,5060,5061,5062,5350,5366,5694,5703,5705,5706],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 9 UCSB With Chance to Make a Statement, Will Face No. 4 UCLA Twice","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MVball_vsNJIT-20160108-DustinHarris-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No. 9 UCSB men's volleyball team is looking to earn a pair of huge victories against No. 4 UCLA this week.

Santa Barbara players have made its home gym a very tough place for opponents to play in so far this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB is an impressive 8-1 at home this year with the lone loss coming in a thrilling five-set match against CSULB, the top-ranked team in the nation.</p>\n<p>Having swept their last four opponents when playing at home, securing a first-round home game in the MPSF playoffs could be advantageous for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of our success here has come from being comfortable in our gym,” Seif said. “We have great fans who we hate to disappoint and we’ve been fortunate enough to win a lot of games at home in recent years.”</p>\n<p>In what has been a fortunately injury-free season for the Gauchos, they may be a starter short heading into UCLA. Redshirt junior Matt Marsh, who missed the CBU match after hurting his ankle last week against USC, is listed as questionable for the Wednesday meeting with the Bruins.</p>\n<p>Freshman Corey Chavers filled in nicely for the injured Marsh against Cal Baptist registering 10 kills and six digs, but the team will miss Marsh’s team-high 3.25 kills per set if he is unable to play.<br>\nUCSB will be tested by the Bruins, and Head Coach Rick McLaughlin is preparing his side for yet another top-five opponent.</p>\n<p>“The team is really focused on winning the serve receive battle this week,” Seif said. “UCLA has a lot of really great servers so it’s important for us to put service pressure on them.”</p>\n<p>The team’s focus on defense has been on display in recent weeks as well. Redshirt junior Parker Boehle, who has only missed six sets since MPSF play began, has been rock solid as of late averaging 2.93 digs per set in the last four matches.</p>\n<p>Against the Bruins, Boehle and Seif, who is second on the team in digs with 1.67 per set, will be tested by the No. 4 team in the nation. However, the Gauchos have a track record of beating UCLA as they won both meetings last season.</p>\n<p>“From recent years we’ve learned that LA is a very consistent team,” Seif said. “They have smart players with coaches that game plan against their opponents strengths well, and we’ll have to do a lot of mid game adjustments this week.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is Wednesday against No. 4 UCLA at the Wooden Center at 7 p.m. The teams meet again Friday at Rob Gym at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68772\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/no-9-ucsb-with-chance-to-make-a-statement-will-face-no-4-ucla-twice/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68772\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/no-9-ucsb-with-chance-to-make-a-statement-will-face-no-4-ucla-twice/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/no-9-ucsb-with-chance-to-make-a-statement-will-face-no-4-ucla-twice/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/no-9-ucsb-with-chance-to-make-a-statement-will-face-no-4-ucla-twice/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/no-9-ucsb-with-chance-to-make-a-statement-will-face-no-4-ucla-twice/","id":5034,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5033,5032,5031],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Begins Four-Match Home Stretch vs. Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MVball_vsUCLA-20160304-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With a current 9-2 home record, the UCSB men's volleyball team will attempt to capitalize on its four-match home stretch to close out the season beginning this Friday vs. the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors.

The setter recorded his sixth double-double of the year with 47 assists and 10 digs and was all over the court in the four-set victory.</p>\n<p>“Jonah’s been phenomenal the past couple months,” junior libero Parker Boehle said of his teammate. “He’s always the one to let us know that we’re fine no matter how bad the situation, and we can always look to him to come up big.”</p>\n<p>Seif also outshined Stanford’s setter James Shaw in last Saturday’s clash, who was honored as the National Player of the Week ahead of the last week of league play. Shaw tallied 31 assists before tweaking his ankle on a block in the fourth set, ending his night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be a man stronger going into their postseason rematch with redshirt junior outside hitter Jacob Delson returning from an ankle injury of his own.</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara’s leading hitter, averaging 3.29 kills/set, Delson was back on the bench on Saturday, but Head Coach Rick McLaughlin decided not to risk playing the outside hitter with their first round match in mind.</p>\n<p>In Delson’s absence, sophomore Hayden Boehle was called upon to fill the void left by Delson’s injury, putting on his best performance of the year at outside hitter after splitting playing time with his brother Parker at libero for most of the season. Against Stanford, Hayden recorded his first double-double of the season with a career-high 12 kills on .526 hitting to go with 10 digs.</p>\n<p>“It helps knowing that guys like my brother Hayden can step up,” Parker Boehle said. “It makes us even more confident that we have a guy [Delson], who’s been a key player for so long that’s ready to contribute.”</p>\n<p>When the teams met at Stanford earlier in the year, the Cardinal sent the Gauchos home in straight sets. Starting with a home loss to Long Beach State, Santa Barbara went 3-7 in its next 10 league games, including the loss to the Cardinal, but UCSB has improved much since then.</p>\n<p>“That loss was one of our worst games, but we’ve put it in the past and last week [against Stanford] we were able to show that we’re a new team,” Boehle said. “We put that game behind us. Later in the season, we’ve had this new mentality where we’re taking every practice, every game a lot differently than we have in the past.”</p>\n<p>The changes have shown, and since their mid-season skid the Gauchos have gone undefeated as they tune up for the postseason, the biggest win of which was the final match of the season against then No. 3 Stanford.</p>\n<p>“We’re fired up to play them again after beating them on our home court,” Boehle said. “We’ve had a great week of practice so far, and we’ll be ready to play them again this weekend.”</p>\n<p>The match between fourth-seed Stanford and fifth-seed UCSB will take place Saturday, April 16 at Maples Pavilion in Stanford, at 7 p.m. A live stream of the first round meeting is available at <a href=\"http://pac-12.com/live/stanford-university\"><em>pac-12.com/live/stanford-university</em></a>.</p>\n<p>With a win, the Gauchos will face the winner of eighth-seed UC Irvine v. first-seed and national No. 1 BYU in the MPSF semifinals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 18 of April 14, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69865\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-begins-mpsf-title-search-at-stanford/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69865\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-begins-mpsf-title-search-at-stanford/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-begins-mpsf-title-search-at-stanford/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-begins-mpsf-title-search-at-stanford/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-begins-mpsf-title-search-at-stanford/","id":5036,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5035,5034,5033],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
