In what has been prematurely deemed one of the best and most important off-seasons in NBA history, the Lakers acquired two future Hall of Famers in Steve Nash and Dwight Howard. But screw that premature praise; the Lakers are going to win the 2013 NBA championship.</p>\n<p>As a Lakers fan, I am absolutely thrilled by the acquisitions of Howard and Nash and on paper, the Lakers should be the most talented team in the league and the front-runner for the championship. However, I want to give caution to both Lakers fans and haters that there will most definitely be bumps in the road. Much like Miami’s first season with “The Big Three”, the Lakers will be heavily scrutinized if they ever lose to a team at the bottom of the standings or go on a three-game-losing streak. Losses will happen; the Lakers will not break records for the most wins in one season, but this will be a supremely talented and entertaining team to watch.</p>\n<p>Miami struggled in its first season to develop chemistry, as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh all struggled to find roles on the Heat. Maybe the Lakers will have some chemistry issues to start the season, but with some of the smartest and hardest-working players in the game, the Lakers’ transition into a poised and cohesive unit should be much faster than that of the Heat.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Pau Gasol, Kobe and Nash possibly have the highest basketball IQ of anyone at their respective positions and Howard is a one-of-a- kind athlete at center. Kobe is no longer 25 years old. He knows he cannot continue to score 30 points a game and he will adapt to the new roster because he will do whatever it takes to win that sixth ring.</p>\n<p>The Lakers might lose a few games early in the season as they find their groove, but come playoff time, they should be the most feared squad in the league and unlike the Heat, finish the first season together as champions.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Point Guard: Steve Nash</strong></p>\n<p>Nash is one of the all-time greats in terms of passing ability and basketball IQ. He is not the most gifted athlete in the world and has never been a great defender, but his abilities on the offensive side of the ball are unquestioned. He averaged over 12 points and 10 assists a game last year. His high assist numbers will be aided by the fact that he is playing with three other All-stars. Expect Nash’s scoring average to stay relatively the same, with his assists rising by one or two a game. Nash can hit the three ball as well, an often forgotten aspect of his game that has been sorely lacking for the Lakers. Starting Shooting Guard: Kobe Bryant</p>\n<p>Kobe is obviously an all-time top-five player. His ability to score in bunches has produced some of the most remarkable performances in the history of the game. At 34 years old, he will not average the nearly 28 points per game he put forth last year. I would say 25 points is a more realistic projection for the guard, with maybe five or six rebounds and assists each a game. With all of the offensive weapons on the team, Kobe’s scoring will drop, but his assist numbers should rise. You know Kobe is hungry for his sixth championship.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Small Forward: Metta World Peace</strong></p>\n<p>World Peace is nowhere near as talented as he was during his days with the Kings and Pacers, but he is still an above average defender.</p>\n<p>Apparently motivated by the new acquisitions, he is in the best shape since his days with the Pacers. If he can perform as he did during the last month of the regular season, where he averaged over 14 points per game, the Lakers will truly have a weapon at each position.</p>\n<p>World Peace will have many opportunities for open shots and if he can knock them down and play tough defense, Los Angeles should be able to beat any team in the league.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Power Forward: Pau Gasol</strong></p>\n<p>Pau’s numbers last year were very inconsistent. He averaged over 17 points per game during the season and nearly 20 during the last month, but his numbers in the playoffs dropped off considerably at under 13 a game. With Howard under the rim, Gasol can play where he is most comfortable — 10-15 feet from the basket — and take more open jumpers. If he can replicate his performance for Spain in this summer’s</p>\n<p>Olympics, he can be one of the top power forwards in the game. When Gasol goes into beast mode, he looks like an</p>\n<p>All-star. The only problem is he lacks that consistent tenacity. Gasol should see a boost in production, as teams will be forced to pay more attention to other weapons on the offense.</p>\n<p>But the main difference between the 2010 Heat and the 2012 Lakers is the unquestioned leadership. Kobe Bryant is the leader of this team. Dwight Howard has even said he is eager to learn from Kobe and is looking forward to being challenged by the hardest working player in the game. Kobe will concede control of the offense to Nash, but control of the game is still his. The same unquestioned leadership could not be said about the Heat.</p>\n<p>LeBron and Wade often struggled in late-game situations, both fighting to be the “Alpha Dog” in the relationship. James had yet to perfect the late-game finishing touch he developed last season. At the end of a game, you know Kobe is taking the last shot if he has it; none of that passing to a backup as LeBron did with Udonis Haslem.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at a position-by-position breakdown for the Lakers and the possible impact each member of the starting five will have on the team this season.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Center: Dwight Howard</strong></p>\n<p>The best big man in the game, Howard is an athletic freak, featuring the speed of a small forward and the power of a center. He opens up the Lakers pick-and-roll game and forces defenders to double-team him so he cannot get to the rim. He may not have a great back to the basket game, but he will have plenty of opportunities to score, especially with Nash passing him the ball. Defensively, Howard is a drastic upgrade over Andrew Bynum and gives the Lakers a defensive presence unmatched in the league.</p>\n<p>The Lake Show will play some entertaining basketball this season. If they can produce on the floor with the talent that they have on paper, this could be a team for the ages. The starting five is set, and with an improved bench consisting of Antawn Jamison, Jordan Hill, Jodie Meeks and Steve Blake, the Lakers have the talent to become champions this season as well as over the next three years. Questions of depth remain for the Lakers, but they possess the most talented starting five in the league. I hope the NBA is ready for an exciting season of basketball.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48072\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-11/powered-starting-lakers-team-beat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48072\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-11/powered-starting-lakers-team-beat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-11/powered-starting-lakers-team-beat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-11/powered-starting-lakers-team-beat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-11/powered-starting-lakers-team-beat/","id":719,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[718,717,716],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Swept by Irvine, Drops to Fifth Place","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A three-day trip to face lower-ranked UC Irvine turned into a three-game series sweep for the Anteaters and two shutout losses for the UCSB baseball team.

Thurman, who holds a 2.61 ERA on the season thus far, threw six strikeouts in Friday’s series opener to add to his 6-2 record on the year.</p>\n<p>“Their pitchers did a really good job of minimizing innings,” Vertigan said. “All of our hits were spread out. We just didn’t get hits at the right times of the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to put runners in scoring position four different times throughout the game, yet could not get a foot past third base. Senior Kevin Gelinas saw action in his first weekend start since February, and though the lefty gave up just two runs in the fifth inning, it was enough to hand him his first loss of the year.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game provided similar results to the first, highlighted by another 2-0 loss for UCSB. Gaucho freshman lefthander Andrew Vasquez’s phenomenal performance over 6.1 innings may have been overshadowed by the loss, yet Vasquez was still able to lower his ERA to 1.69 by allowing just one run during his time on the mound.</p>\n<p>UCSB was again able to manage just four hits in the game, two of which came from the bat of Vertigan. Vertigan, who has twice been named Big West Player of the Week so far this season, currently leads the team offensively with a .370 batting average and a .519 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>In the closing game of the series on Sunday, UCSB was able to put players past home plate four times, yet it wasn’t enough to match the five runs scored by UCI. Gaucho sophomore inf ielder Brandon Trinkwon led all hitters in the game with four hits in five at-bats, forcing the UCI pitching staff to switch up its gameplan.</p>\n<p>“We actually got to their bullpen and were able to put some pressure on that first [pitcher],” Vertigan said. “Once we got him out of the game, it was kind of a big deal because once you get to their pen, it gets easier to get after teams.”</p>\n<p>Digging in to the Anteater bullpen for 12 hits on 38 at-bats wasn’t enough for the Gauchos to overcome Irvine’s four-run inning in the fourth, as they fell 5-4 in the top of the ninth.</p>\n<p>“We definitely pitched good enough and played good enough defense to win those games,” Vertigan said. “If we had played our game, we could’ve beaten them in all three games.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos return to practice this week to prepare for a three-game home series against Cal State Fullerton this weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-swept-irvine-drops-place/","id":716,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[715,714,713],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Dominate at Home in Exhibition Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB kicked off the 2012-2013 men’s basketball season with a 74-50 victory in an exhibition game over La Verne College Thursday night at the Thunderdome.

Williams led the Gauchos with 11 points in the half to build a 37-26 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Overall, 11 players recorded double digit minutes for the Gauchos as the team tried to develop chemistry between specific rotations.</p>\n<p>“If I get an open layup and I’m knocking it down, then great. But if I see an open shooter I’m going to swing it to him,” Big Al said. “That’s the good thing about this team … everybody on the floor can score. It’s about whatever the team needs and whatever coach tells us .”</p>\n<p>Starting the game for the Gauchos were freshman guard Dalante Dunklin and forward Taran Brown, sophomore forward Lewis Thomas, Williams and junior guard Kyle Boswell. Thomas was second on the team with nine points, while Brown scored five points and grabbed seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>“I like the chemistry. When you see teams that share the ball, I think it’s good chemistry,” Coach Williams said. “The fact that we are at this stage pretty darn unselfish is a good sign to me.” With a point guard battle brewing between four players, senior Nate Garth seemed to have the best night of the bunch with five points and a team-high five assists. “This team will peak in January and February, and I can guarantee that we’ll be at the top of the Big West,” Garth said. “We’re very talented and all we need to do is learn the ins and outs and the little things of the game, and that will make big differences.”</p>\n<p>Providing a spark for Santa Barbara in the second half was junior forward Shawn Moore, who notched an impressive eight points and seven rebounds in a mere 10 minutes on the floor.</p>\n<p>“I was happy for him [tonight], because he was really struggling in practice the last couple of weeks,” Coach Williams said. “I think tonight will give him a lot of confidence. I think he did a great job during his minutes. He’s begging for more minutes.”</p>\n<p>Numerous freshmen logged playing time for UCSB as forward Mitch Brewe recorded seven points and six rebounds, while forward Sam Beeler had six points and three boards. Dunklin scored only two points, but contributed with four assists and two steals. Bryson added seven points during his time on the floor.</p>\n<p>One area of concern for UCSB was the 18 turnovers committed compared to only 16 for La Verne.</p>\n<p>“We made bad decisions, and I don’t know if it’s just first game jitters because we’ve been doing it a little bit in practice,” Coach Williams said. “It’s going to be a requirement that we get better with the basketball.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins regular season play at LSU on Nov. 9.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB men’s basketball team had a triumphant return home Saturday night against the University of San Diego, grinding out a 67-57 victory.</p>\n<p>This was Gauchos’ fifth-straight win, their biggest streak since March 2015, and the team now has as many wins as they had all of last season with a 6-2 record. The Toreros are now building the wrong kind of streak as this was their second loss in a row, and they now sit at 5-2.</p>\n<p>Most of the first half could be summed up with one word: sloppy. The first two minutes included six missed shots, two missed free-throws, two turnovers, and zero points. The Gauchos didn’t even score until three minutes in, when graduate transfer Marcus Jackson took advantage of an errant pass and took it home for a dunk. Jackson finished with an all-around stat line of 12 points 3 rebounds and 4 assists, yet his biggest impact was on the defensive end where he was tasked with facing the Toreros’ best player in Isaiah Wright.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Wright came into the matchup leading his team in almost all offensive categories, and postgame Coach Joe Pasternack reiterated just how important it was for the Gauchos to have held him to only 11 points on 5/14 shooting on the game. “We knew he was the head of the team”, Pasternack expressed. “Marcus and the rest of the squad did a great job cutting off the head and forcing the ball elsewhere”.</p>\n<p>The head of the Gauchos for the first half was Leland King II, who finished the game with yet another double-double performance of 18 points and 12 rebounds. He was the only one who had anything going early on, at one point scoring eight straight points on consecutive trips.</p>\n<p>The forward knew that he was going to have to produce early on for the team to have success. “They were switching the point guard on me so I used my size early on”, he admitted postgame. “It’s all about drawing attention to make the game easier for my teammates”.</p>\n<p>Although guard Olin Carter III had a solid first half for USD, in which he picked up eight points, no other player stepped up for the Toreros which led to a 32-25 lead for UCSB going into halftime.</p>\n<p>The second half was all about digging deep on the defensive end for the Gauchos and just letting the offense flow naturally. This was made much easier by the shooting of Max Heidegger, who after a quiet first half made a few key shots as the game came down to the wire. The 8th leading scorer in the country showcased why he deserves national acclaim, at one point he had consecutive possessions with long Steph Curry-like threes, one of which became and And-1 as he got fouled coming down.</p>\n<p>USD’s best players came out to play in the second half however, as forward Isaiah Pineiro almost had a double double in the half alone, getting 12 points and 8 rebounds. Junior Isaiah Wright also played far better, knocking in 10 points and at one point they had cut the lead down to four points.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, the Gauchos defense was too much for the Toreros. Coach Pasternack emphasized after the game that: “This team’s identity is defense,” and from the way in which the Gauchos performed, it would be hard to argue against him.</p>\n<p>Having a strong and communicative defense is essential for any team that wants to have prolonged success, which is what Coach P and the Gauchos seem to be laying the foundation for now.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.
