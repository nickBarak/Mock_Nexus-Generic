After some attendees worked for hours to secure their spots outside The Arlington Theatre, the crowd’s anticipation was brought to an absolute high when they greeted the actors stepping out of their blacked-out Escalades. The camaraderie displayed amongst the group of stars was shown through moments such as John Boyega’s imitation of Pinocchio from “Shrek” to Kumail Nanjiani’s timely, comedic jabs at the other actors.</p>\n<p>This year’s Virtuosos Award recipients included Mary J. Blige (“Mudbound”), John Boyega (“Detroit”), Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me By Your Name”), Hong Chau (“Downsizing”), Daniel Kaluuya (“Get Out”) and Kumail Nanjiani (“The Big Sick”).</p>\n<p>The night began with SBIFF Director Roger Durling announcing that recipient Gal Gadot (“Wonder Woman”) would not be in attendance due to a case of the flu. This did not seem to temper the audience’s excitement, as their eager faces waited to hear the rest of the lineup speak about working on their Oscar-nominated films. Dave Karger moderated the event for the eighth consecutive year and briefly spoke about the natural calamity faced by the Santa Barbara and Montecito communities. “I know that it has not been an easy few months and I just hope that we can provide you all with a couple hours of joy and entertainment,” he said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After Karger announced that Mary J. Blige was “the first person to ever be nominated for acting and songwriting for the same movie in the same year,” the artist received a standing ovation from the audience. Blige described the utter shock of finding out she was nominated for two Oscars, one for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Florence in the Netflix film “Mudbound” and the other for her Best Original Song for her song “Mighty River.”</p>\n<p>Blige cited her New York upbringing and Southern roots in helping her role as the Mississippi-raised Florence flourish on screen. Blige’s portrayal of the matriarch is one that challenges prejudice and acts as a mission statement for the future. Blige said playing Florence served as a healing process. “It gave me a place to give all the heaviness that I felt trapped in, and let Florence have every single pain and every confusion,” she said.  Blige confidently confirmed that she will be singing “Mighty River” on the Oscars telecast, comparing this reality to a dream that she expects someone to pinch her out of.</p>\n<p>John Boyega’s role as Melvin Dismukes in “Detroit” created a platform from which to speak against the police brutality experienced by black men in the 1967 Detroit riots. Much like fellow Virtuosos award recipient Daniel Kaluuya’s performance in “Get Out,” Boyega and Kaluuya’s characters were portraits of racial tragedies and injustice. Boyega exuded the confidence of a seasoned actor as he charismatically waltzed onto the stage and gushed about being in Santa Barbara for the first time. Karger asked Boyega about the intricate performance he gave during an interrogation scene in “Detroit” where his character’s hands are trembling with insecurity and nervousness. Boyega recalled how meeting Melvin Dismukes affected his honest portrayal of a man who experienced a pivotal time in history: “A big thing was trying to get to know him separate from his circumstance in the movie. I noticed that he was an introvert, which gave me a clue on how to navigate a performance like that.” Despite being a British actor playing an American man, Boyega did not choose to adopt a method style of acting. He stated that whenever he had a break from shooting, “dropping the accent meant dropping the intensity of the role.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80887\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1054904681\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80885\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80887\" data-attachment-id=\"80887\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/mask-thomas-fire-by-sicheng-wang-online-24/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?fit=2000%2C1330&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1330\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF by Joshua Wu\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80887\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-24.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘Get Out’ star Daniel Kaluuya posing on the red carpet at the 2018 Santa Barbara International Film Festival Virtuosos Awards. <em>Joshua Wu / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Boyega received a rousing of applause when he stated that people should not be apprehensive about watching “Detroit” because, “This is our mess;

The American actor, nominated for an Academy Award, was recognized at the SBIFF for his roles in ‘Call Me By Your Name’ and ‘Lady Bird.’ <em>Joshua Wu / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Chalamet handles Karger’s questions in a way similar to the quirky awkwardness of a character in a coming-of-age indie film. His reaction to Karger inquiring about the infamous peach scene in<em> “</em>Call Me By Your Name” was met with slight laughter, accompanied by the sarcastic, “I have been waiting for this moment my whole life!” Chalamet says he did three takes for the last scene of the film, where he is seated by a fireplace as Sufjan Stevens’s “Visions of Gideon” acts as a consoling backdrop to his crying. Luca Guadagnino has pondered about possibly making a sequel to “Call Me By Your Name,” and Chalamet says he will be on board with the project. “I mean yeah, that would mean employment,” he said.</p>\n<p>Clad in Gucci loafers, Daniel Kaluuya, stepped onto the stage, giving a shou-tout to three-time Academy Award nominee “Get Out” director Jordan Peele. Kaluuya states that Peele was hesitant to give the part of Chris to a British actor as he felt it was particular to an African-American storyline.</p>\n<p>“If you leave the M25 in Britain, it’s “Get Out.” I live this. He [Peele] uses African-American voice and perspective to tap into a universal black truth navigating a Western construct,” Kaluuya said. Kaluuya’s way of portraying Chris, a man who is plagued with confusion, denial and trauma amidst a falsely idyllic family was by “thinking with emotions and music.”</p>\n<p>“The Big Sick’s” Kumail Nanjiani had the audience in fits of laughter. He compared making “The Big Sick” to getting out the last bits of ketchup from out of a bottle. “It was like a bottle of old ketchup that you have to slap the back of,” he said. “And the congealed piece comes out, and finally the rest will come out. This movie was the congealed piece.” He spoke on co-writing the break-up scene that “The Big Sick’s” storyline revolves around with his wife, Emily V. Gordon: “It was interesting when I was writing the break-up scene and I thought I was making some great points, but when I got the rewrite, Emily was making some great points as well.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80889\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1753104709\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80885\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80889\" data-attachment-id=\"80889\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/2018-sbiff-virtuosos-awards-shine-bright/mask-thomas-fire-by-sicheng-wang-online-25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?fit=2000%2C1330&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1330\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SBIFF by Dafan Huang\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80889\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mask-Thomas-Fire-by-Sicheng-Wang-ONLINE-25.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80889\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘Detroit’ star John Boyega at the 2018 Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <em>Joshua Wu / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Nanjiani also addressed the long-term effects of Gordon’s illness and beamed about how the happiness he felt for Gordon’s Oscar nomination superseded the happiness he felt over his: “The first thing I felt when we received the Oscar nomination was such pride in her.

Although it had been 14 years for us, for Jack himself, it had been 50. During that time, the wandering samurai went through several traumatic events that left him without his sword, his optimism and his humanity. This change of tone allowed creator Genndy Tartakovsky to forego the original show’s episodic format in favor of a serialized journey.</p>\n<p>As a result, we got an emotionally harrowing tale of a worn-down Jack, who has by now gone full Mad Max, riding a motorcycle and shooting guns. He fights his suicidal guilt over not only failing to return to the past to save his family, but also failing to save those who have fallen victim to the rule of Aku (now voiced by Greg Baldwin). Meanwhile, Jack must confront and face newcomer Ashi (Tara Strong, a.k.a. Timmy Turner), a woman with a traumatic past who is more than capable of kicking Jack’s ass. Together, they endure many misadventures that allow us to ease back into the wonderfully weird world of our favorite time-displaced samurai.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Notably, the switch from plain old Cartoon Network to the Adult Swim time slot allowed the show to be grittier, bloodier, more emotionally wrenching and gave us the line, “Woah, what a freak. Looked like a talking penis,” from Tom Kenny (the voice of Spongebob Squarepants).</p>\n<p>This change in tone is welcome, as everyone who watched “Jack” as a child (myself included) have all grown up. While I wouldn’t say we were hungry for guts and gore (which this season has used sparingly), we certainly came to expect something more engrossing that would justify the series’s 13-year absence. We got it.</p>\n<p>Holy shit did we. But the show’s return is also indicative of a current trend in the television landscape: the appeal to nostalgia.</p>\n<p>No-brainer, right? If it was popular once, why not bring it back (cough someone renew “Firefly” dammit cough)?  We’re seeing the likes of “Twin Peaks,” “Gilmore Girls,” “Voltron,” “24,” “Arrested Development,” “Ben 10,” “Dragon Ball Super,” “Young Justice,” et cetera, et cetera, coming back from the grave (or at least from the line at the morgue). All of these shows are either revivals or sequels of a once-popular franchise that has been kept alive via an intravenous stream of fan demand. The market for nostalgia is exploding.</p>\n<p>You can see this pretty clear within season five of “Jack” itself.  Although technology has marched on (everything is animated digitally), the show’s visual style has stayed almost exactly the same, despite Taratovsky having experimented with other styles and formats. There’s an episode where Ashi runs into a whole plethora of characters from the original run of “Samurai Jack.” The re-animated flashback scenes are staged almost exactly like the original versions, setting up the viewer for an emotional reminiscence before eventually getting back to the action at hand.</p>\n<p>Basically, TV shows have discovered that the best way to rein us in is tossing a barbed lasso around our hearts and memories. As cheesy and stupid a metaphor as that sounds (you can see why I am not a poet), it sure as hell works. The last two “Star Wars” movies made more than a billion dollars at the box office. So did “Beauty and the Beast.” There’s even a “live-action” “The Lion King” coming up and I will bet my firstborn — whenever they come into existence — that it will make just as much money as the aforementioned films.</p>\n<p>Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily. We get to see the stories of stuff we love re-imagined and the people who took the effort of others and gave it a new coat of paint get a shitload of money … hm.</p>\n<p>Okay, let’s look at it another way. These continuations of our childhoods allow us, I believe, to stop and reflect for a moment on how we’ve grown. We can see how culture has aged with us; we get to reflect on why we fell in love with these shows in the first place. Or maybe we’re just children in the bodies of college students. If so, I’d like to propose a resolution to A.S. that we place a giant ball pit in front of Storke Tower.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, where was I? Ah, right. This Saturday, “Samurai Jack” will end. How? Who knows? But after so many years, many of us will gain closure. We will get to see a journey we’ve been watching since 2001 finally come to an end, along with a chapter of our childhoods. There better be gallons of blood all over the screen.</p>\n<p><em>Alex Wehrung clearly has no idea what the hell he is talking about and it’s a wonder we haven’t fired him yet.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/beloved-cartoon-samurai-jack-comes-and-goes/","id":5807,"author":{"id":739,"name":"Alex Wehrung"},"related":[5806,5805,5804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Pride: Standing Strong in the Face of Adversity","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Ali Gerrard explains why Isla Vista is still our beautiful home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I have desperately tried to avoid social media and the media in general over the past few days.

Yes, it’s very reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde, except that it’s not entirely. James proclaims himself as a sociopath within the first 40 seconds of the show, taking pleasure in killing small animals and self-inflicting pain (showing off an entire burnt hand to prove it). He later explains that he engages in these behaviors in order to make himself feel something after witnessing his mother’s suicide. Except now, he’s ready to move on to bigger targets. This is where Alyssa comes in, a brazen girl with a strong IDGAF attitude battling her own issues at home.</p>\n<p>The pilot wastes no time in jumping to the “boy meets girl” trope and executes it in a brilliantly humorous and blunt way; it may be one of my favorite introductions in television history.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’ve seen you skating,” Alyssa says to James in the school cafeteria. “You’re pretty shit.”</p>\n<p>James response?</p>\n<p>“Fuck off.”</p>\n<p>As the pilot progresses, we discover that while James is fantasizing about Alyssa becoming his first human murder, she begins to grow comfortable with him, even saying he’s someone she could fall in love with. If that’s not depressing, then I don’t know what is. Evidently enough, Alyssa easily sways James into ditching town with her and he goes along for the ride, as he finds it the perfect opportunity to murder her. By the end of the episode, the two hop in James’s dad’s car and embark on a road trip that promptly becomes more of an impulsive crime spree (the “armed” robbery is hands down one of my favorite scenes) as they search for Alyssa’s father.</p>\n<p>The show moves back and forth between perspectives, providing deeper insight in getting to know our antiheroine and antihero. Through the characters’ inner monologues, done wonderfully through voiceovers, we gain a deeper understanding of their personalities. James’s thoughts convey a monotone indifference to match his perpetually disturbed yet aloof façade; Alyssa, on the hand, is quite multifaceted.</p>\n<p>Despite her aggressively upfront, careless approach (throwing curses shamelessly at the world, rolling her eyes at anything and everything), thoughts expose her as vulnerable and wounded. It’s comical as viewers to watch how vastly different these two characters are; Alyssa is all nihilistic spunk and spontaneity while James is merely a bystander to all her wayward antics.</p>\n<p>At the core of it all, they are two teens struggling with that awkward in between: they’re not quite adults and not quite kids anymore. They’re brimming with a bleak resentment to an awful society, taking out their frustrations and fragilities in a manner that’s both droll and gloomy.</p>\n<p>However, what makes this story so oddly beautiful is the human connection that is made between two people who seem so, well, inhuman. It’s when Alyssa somehow finds her way back to James and when James somehow can’t bring himself to leave Alyssa in spite of her mad father — it’s these moments that display how much they’ve come to care for each other. The sinister events that follow their escape and mutual feeling of adolescent confusion tie them together, a bond that can’t be broken. No matter how deranged the story is, it’s a story of love.</p>\n<p>Overall, “The End of the F***ing World” provides all the essentials for an indie teen flick: a road trip, a banging soundtrack, running from the authorities, two underdogs we <em>really shouldn’t be rooting for</em>, but do anyway … and an honorary mention to the wardrobe change mid-season (a Hawaiian shirt makes for a perfect disguise, right?).</p>\n<p>However, all this would not be so easy to binge in an entire day if it weren’t for the compelling acting of the two leads. Barden pins the tail right on the donkey with her character; while playing a bratty teenage girl with issues sounds derivative and cliché, it’s done with a complexity one simply can’t help but love. I fear her, but I also just want to be her mom friend.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lawther’s performance is phenomenal, capturing all the subtle intricacies that make James so disconcerting and intriguing to watch (I expected nothing less after seeing him on “Black Mirror”). As each episode briskly passes by, it becomes hard to not fall for the charms of the duo.</p>\n<p>Writer Charlie Covell and director Jonathan Entwistle remarkably capture the genuine connection that evolves between Alyssa and James. It’s a fast-paced story, jumping from one mishap to another, with side narratives that thankfully do not detract from the main plot — everything is well interwoven until the very end of the series. Right when you become engrossed into this explicitly dark, dark world, it all comes to an end, and eight episodes suddenly feels far too short.</p>\n<p>It’s unlike any show I’ve seen on television; it’s the perfect storm of teenage rebellion to a heightened ending. Despite the ambiguous finale that leaves the viewer in a stupor, desperately itching for more, it’s hard to envision continuing this world after the helter-skelter chaos of one season. Bravo Alyssa and James, for making a love story truly feel like the end of the fucking world.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80675\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80675\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/the-end-of-the-fing-world-a-teenage-rebellion/","id":5809,"author":{"id":655,"name":"Jasmine Benafghoul"},"related":[5808,5807,5806],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
