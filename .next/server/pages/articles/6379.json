Our campus is one of the most well known in the world due to our lectures being accessible across a variety of electronics.

Shifting between websites has never been easier unless you are a professor who expects to know about our technology without investing time to learn how to use it. We also love how attendees are able to annotate directly on the shared screen for everyone to see.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not know how to use our resources, don’t worry! Spend an hour or two with friends, exploring our platform. Play with virtual backgrounds. A quick search on our website can answer your queries. You can also reach out to your instructors for help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your instructors will arrive a second before class starts, so don’t worry about leaving your place to arrive on time. Our instructors have excellent interpersonal skills. They like to wait a few minutes before officially starting a lecture: greeting students, oversharing or sitting in charming silence. I also certainly respect how our instructors have transitioned their lectures to be Zoom-friendly. No more iClicker questions. No more class readers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe in freedom of expression, allowing our students to demonstrate their individuality through their nicknames and chat room conversations. However, if a neighbor’s lawn mower roars, if your sister decides to blast reggae music or if your dog demonstrates their yearn for your attention through intense barking in the middle of a lecture, we expect you to mute yourself. Effective communication is our priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to turn on your camera, so the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawthorne effect</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ensures that you are not goofing off. But make sure to tilt the camera away a little if you want to play chess or take a shower while on your phone. We support well-rounded students who participate in extracurriculars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also understand that everyone has different personalities. If you are a little bit shy or you have just woken up from a fat nap, or are in the process of diving back into a fat nap, nobody will be offended if you turn off your camera. But imagine your professor speaking to named black screens. Think of how lonely and awkward they must feel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We trust that you are capable of taking care of your own wellness. If you are hungry, bring a snack to your back-to-back Zoom meetings or bring your device to the kitchen. Meditate in between classes. Thanks to COVID-19, we have at-home exercise classes like yoga available if you know where to look.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you for choosing Zoom University.

Today our topic is one of much excitement: kinky sex. But before we get there we must take a peek into my past, so you can understand how I have suffered for this cause. Now, please understand when going into this story that the spirit of it all was admirable. The carrying out was less so. This article will offer suggestions that, had my partner been aware of such things, may have lessened my plight. That’s right; it’s time for another awkward sexual anecdote.</p>\n<p>It was summer 2012. My small tank of a friend had persuaded me to drink copious amounts of alcohol before taking me to a frat party. Shortly after arriving, I found a companion for the evening and we made it over to his place. Both fairly tipsy, he was a tad rough, not in the delightful way I will be encouraging, but in the, “Ow, ow, softer dumbass,” way. This is where things went terribly wrong. Like a good partner, he was terribly eager to go south, and that’s when I opened my big dumb mouth. “Bite my thigh,” I foolishly uttered. Grinning saucily up at me, he did as he was told. However, when I said bite, I meant really more of a nip, something soft and inspiring. What I got was a bruise that lasted three weeks. It looked like someone had shot a baseball at my thigh at a whopping 60 mph. For days I could not fathom how it got there, I was too consumed with agitation at the eight hickies he had dispatched across my neck. The moment of realization was characterized by sheer horror: Yes, those were teeth indents. The moral of this story is thus: A) a number of my sexual situations are uncomfortable and weird and B) bite others as you would like to be bitten. Now, to be sure, I am happy he bit me. I wish he hadn’t bit me like he was making an appearance in Shark Week, but I appreciate his willingness to adventure. And that is what characterizes much of the kink.</p>\n<p>As unabashed as I am in ranting about my junk and sexual prowess to you nice people, I too occasionally remain mum on my desire for hair pulling, ass smacking and mouth covering. When I was hooking up with a BDSM dom (bondage, dominance, sadism, masochism) back in fall quarter, I felt I was finally getting an outlet for all the wild things I really wanted to do. It was the most fun I’ve ever had in bed, hands down, because it was so fresh and bad and shameful that it made sex new and shiny all over again. When did sex become so routine? Shouldn’t you blush just a tad when you think of the things you did? At this point it’s become, “Oh yeah, we hooked up, had sex, whatevs.” For shame! I want to see girls whispering behind their hands into their friends’ ears about the wild and crazy things they’ve done in the dark.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Now, a lot of people are freaked out by the idea of kinky sex. You can imagine why. Their mind goes to the freaky German dungeon porn they came across when they clicked the wrong pop-up on the internet. But rest assured, there are ways to be kinky in your interactions without freaky torture machines.</p>\n<p>For those uncomfortable with kinky sex, that is just fine. This article may not apply to you. However, there is the chance that you might be with someone who digs some kink one night and you should have some awareness as to handle the situation. A big disappointment occurs when an individual actually asks to get kinkier, after summoning the courage, but their partner, unsure, half asses it. Fake it, guys, fake it. If your partner senses your inhibition or your lack of commitment, they become disappointed and may be discouraged to ask in the future. Additionally, don’t make them ask more than once. If they ask at all and you’re down at all, expect to include it in your sexual routine.</p>\n<p>Another important note for the unsure is this: Try everything once. If you don’t like it, you don’t like it. Now you know. As a rule, try to keep open minded about everything until you can say for yourself that it does not appeal to you. Now that we have these things in mind, we can move on.</p>\n<p>First, let us visit the very important distinction of biting verses nipping. Nipping is applied to sensitive areas like nipples, earlobes, THIGHS. Biting is sometimes for necks, shoulders and less sensitive areas. Be aware of sensitivity prior your chomp fest. Perhaps the most important thing you can take away from my advice on bighting is to do unto others as you would have them do for you. Bite experimentally; start off light always. If they want it harder, they’ll ask and you can build up. Or if they are fairly quiet, maybe your partner is a bit less sensitive and you can take that as a cue.</p>\n<p>Aside from biting, there is the classic ass smack. Now, if you’re really going to smack someone’s ass, it is important to rub it out afterwards. You smack, and then rub your palm in circles in the afflicted area. This significantly lessens the pain and gives it more of a pleasurable edge. Plus, you get a good grope in.</p>\n<p>Scratching is also wonderful. My last partner looks like he was mauled by a pack of disgruntled cats. It’s the same with biting, start a little lightly to see if they like it. If they like the biting, you can be sure they like the scratching. Try not to rip off a layer of skin, if you can help it.</p>\n<p>Hair pulling should be done as close to the roots as possible, with a handful of hair, not a small section. This reduces the pain and instead causes a refreshing sensation. I have had my hair pulled improperly. Imagine if you will, yours truly seated upon a frat kitchen counter, with my head basically touching my back. Humans are not supposed to bend that way, or they would have named us Gumbies. The arc is nice, but please, do not break your partner’s neck.</p>\n<p>When it comes to choking, I, personally, am not a fan. I was making out with this guy and he started doing it and I stopped him. Confused, his response was thus, “Did you have an abusive boyfriend?” …to which I replied, “No, I just like breathing.” Simple as that. However, some girls are super hot for this. After discussing it with my associates, the key is not to suffocate her (dur), but instead to apply light pressure. Place your hand on her neck, and press slightly with the flat of your palm. Then minimally increase the pressure, if encouraged by your bedmate.</p>\n<p>Now, while I may personally dislike choking, mouth covering is another thing altogether. Some of us are louder than others. Roommates are often less than thrilled with our sexual presence. My favorite remedy to this conflict of interest is for a guy to muffle my cries with his palm. Gents, do this while whispering quietly in her ear, “shhh.” Continuing this tangent of covering, a good friend of mine goes crazy when you cover her eyes. It’s a simpler form of blindfolding and it really just gives that feeling of susceptibility.</p>\n<p>In terms of being tied up, oh yum. Now, it probably isn’t a good first hook up move to break out the silken ties or handcuffs. But, you can absolutely pin them down. This is unbelievably hot. Do that. It’s fun to squirm in your hold and it establishes your dominance which is something a lot of people fail to do. Sex is best in my opinion with a bit of a power struggle.</p>\n<p>Finally, and most kinkily, in my humble opinion is getting in your partner’s head. Saying things. Having them say things. Commanding them to do things. For those of you who have deigned to read my vibrator article, you may remember the anecdote of my partner informing me that I must petition him on whether or not I could come. This is a prime example. The best way to get someone in a submissive head state, I’ve come to believe, is to have them repeat a phrase over and over. Approximately three to five times. If done properly, it puts you in a trance like state. I shit you not. For instance, “What am I doing to you?” Fill in the blank, “What can I do to you?” To which you say breathily, “Whatever you want.” Repeat this sequence three or so times, preferably while pleasuring them so they are foggy headed and unquestioning of your bizarre inclination to repeat yourself.</p>\n<p>I will leave out other things for fear that they cannot be published. All in all, it is important to push your boundaries and try new things. You’ll never know unless you try. Undoubtedly, a lack of kink is the most lamented aspect of many individuals’ sex lives. That and an inkling as to where the clitoris is. So my darlings, break the bondage of standard sex and get a little spicy! Adios muchachos; hump most happily!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. knows how to keep a hose flowing, even when it’s kinked.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49570\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49570\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/","id":6376,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6375,6374,6373],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"What Happens Before Sex (And, No, This Time We’re Not Talking Foreplay)","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Come hither, my brethren, let us unite once more over our love of all things saucy.

As Valentine’s Day is approaching, and is thus undoubtedly on the minds of most women out there, I feel a slight mix-up in the itinerary of intimacy that is called for. That’s right, gentlemen, I am publicly reminding all of you that the 14th is almost here. Panic accordingly.</p>\n<p>Today I’ll be ranting at you about dates. Knowledge of how to be successful on dates is of paramount importance! Without it, your future Valentine’s Days will be characterized by watching “Sleepless in Seattle,” surrounded by your 14 cats, each named after a squandered romantic pursuit, regardless of your gender — because everyone loves Meg Ryan.</p>\n<p>I love dates. I am a dater. Many girls I know bemoan their lack of dates. They grieve, “Why don’t guys ask me on dates?” Half of the dates I go on, however, I initiate. If I’m interested in someone, then why not? It’s very easy. All you do is go “Hey, we should get lunch sometime,” or “Hey, I’ve been contemplating tearing your clothes off with my teeth, perhaps we should indulge in the preliminary niceties.” Voila! If they say no, it’s no big deal. If you’re worried you’ll ruin a potential friendship or they may not be into you, don’t sweat it. It’s just lunch.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I will be covering three types of dates in this article: 1) my formula for a casual first date</p>\n<p>2) dates with people you’ve been seeing a little while and 3) dates for people you’re emotionally invested in.</p>\n<p>As far as casual lunch dates go, I have settled upon a simple formula. The rules are as follows:</p>\n<p>I get nervous before these dates. If I really don’t know the person that well and am unsure if I will have much to say, I’ll take a shot. A little liquid courage. Now, obviously, don’t get hammered before your date. Slurring at noon is generally frowned upon by the populace (even in I.V.).</p>\n<p>Have pocket questions. Nothing is worse than having an awkward lull so I come to a date with about four questions I can pull out if things get suddenly quiet. I try to make my four questions something that will give me a little insight to who they might be. For example, “What did you do this summer?” or “Why did you pick your major?” or “So tell me about the past three girls you’ve seen who’ve all gone mysteriously missing.” These will lead to them talking about their friends, hobbies or dreams. Bam. If it’s flowing well, you won’t have to pull out any more of your questions.</p>\n<p>I always plan to have my dates an hour before a commitment, like a class. This way, if it is a bad date or not too interesting, I have something I can leave for. There’s a definitive time limit. If it’s an awesome date, I’ll show my hesitation to leave, or simply blow off class. If it’s super bad, I can leave even earlier to “grab my school supplies.”</p>\n<p>Finally, the best way to make a lunch date just a little better is to take it to the beach. No one ever goes to the beach as much as they’d like to and it puts a little less pressure on conversation.</p>\n<p>Now, outside of the typical lunch date, there are some other options you can visit. Make her food. This is the best, most simple date to do … even if you suck at cooking. This really sweet delivery boy from work offered to make me dinner and after he said it, he immediately panicked. He had no idea how to cook. He had bought a bottle of wine and informed me that we were going to have pasta alfredo. Leaving the room, I returned to see him dumping clumps of frozen pasta alfredo from Trader Joe’s into a skillet. I didn’t even know it came like that. He promptly blushed, saying, “You weren’t supposed to see this part … I was going to throw the bags away.” I had a ton of fun, because a) he wanted to do something sweet for me, even if he lacked the skill and b) I couldn’t stop giggling the entire time. It came out gray, but I ate it anyway, especially after drinking the wine.</p>\n<p>Guys, if you can cook, that’s a major selling point. Invite her over, involve her in the process and you will both enjoy the end product. Girls, as I said, if you’re asking them out, this is a totally viable option for you, too. Sure you may have to suffer through some, “woman, make me a sammech” jokes, but a quick kick to the shin should quiet them.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been dating someone with some regularity, Valentine’s Day is a good opportunity to raise the bar. Being the hopeless romantics we are, I suppose we want you to take advantage of the one day of the year dedicated to romance and woo us. Woo the shit out of us. Last year, I had an awesome Valentine’s Day date, because my date built the event around what he knew about me. Knowing I had an unhealthy obsession with scary movies, he decided to appeal to that part of me. After dinner, he presented me with the agenda: We were going to drive to the top of a mountain to explore the ruins of Hearst Castle with flashlights and a baseball bat (safety first). Up the windy roads we drove, until civilization was but small dots in the valley. I briefly considered if he was going to murder me, but allowed the procession to venture forth. Sure, we had to look out for mountain lions and terrifying homeless men who were lurking around in the dark, but I loved it.</p>\n<p>If she likes hiking, go on a hike together with a picnic. If she likes art, pick up stuff to craft and watch a movie with some takeout or go to an art show. She likes making sculptures of her lover’s head out of gum and erecting shrines in her closet: run.</p>\n<p>Also, if you’re not terribly creative, you can always do something simple: Tell her you like her. I know a few girls who are sulking about because the guy they’ve been seeing hasn’t just said it. Sure it’s understood, but people still need to hear it. It’s something small, but it’s the best gift.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is the date for the people you are really invested in, maybe someone you love. I was talking to a good friend of mine who’s been with a girl for ages now, and he told me about their first date. This is the coup de grâce of dates. He picks up his lady love, looking sharp and smelling nice. Compliments should be the first thing out of your mouth, especially when they’re honest. If you’re thinking it, say it; it can only make her feel good. He made a reservation at a nice Japanese restaurant, got her whatever she wanted and filled the night with good conversation. After, they scoped out dessert, holding hands. Then, they went to go see “Whose Line is it Anyway?” at the Granada. Once home, he walked her to the door and they shared a short but sweet kiss before he went on his way. He wanted her to know that spending the whole night with her for one 10-second kiss was worth it all.</p>\n<p>That, ladies and gentlemen, is a date. I probably would have mauled my partner at the end like a rabid badger, but chastity does convey a message.</p>\n<p>All in all, sex is fun, but don’t pass up your chance for something better when it comes along. So go, my darlings, channel your inner Don Juan DeMarco and woo the pants off of your emotional targets. Be cheesy, be corny, be sappy. Happy Humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. would like to remind those without dates that there’s always vodka and Ben n’ Jerry’s Half Baked.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50054\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/what-happens-before-sex-and-no-this-time-were-not-talking-foreplay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50054\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/what-happens-before-sex-and-no-this-time-were-not-talking-foreplay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/what-happens-before-sex-and-no-this-time-were-not-talking-foreplay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/what-happens-before-sex-and-no-this-time-were-not-talking-foreplay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/what-happens-before-sex-and-no-this-time-were-not-talking-foreplay/","id":6377,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6376,6375,6374],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Definition of Virginity is Unqueer","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2018-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_3274.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_3274.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Anabel Costa challenges the heteronormative cultural parameters for intimacy.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone likes to talk about sex, and growing up, virginity always seemed to take the spotlight. Sleepovers are riddled with questions like, “When will I lose my virginity?” or, “How did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lose your virginity?” These questions always plagued me, yet at the same time, they brought immense curiosity. As a queer woman, I have a lot of confusion and frustration with the word itself. Over time I’ve come to realize that virginity doesn’t even exist; by definition, it refers to the first time someone has sex, but sex can mean different things to different people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the occasions that I have found myself in a circle of friends, talking about virginity or how we lost it, more than one of the stories always seem to end with some statement like, “It went in and out like three times and then we were done.” Now, there is nothing wrong with this, and if both members felt like it was sex, then it was, because sex should be defined by the individuals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My issues with this only come in when queer women who have had sex with other women are considered virgins simply because they’ve never been penetrated. My girlfriend has been called a virgin by our friends because they don’t readily accept what we do as sex. So if my intimate experiences with my girlfriend are not sex, then neither is your “in and out three times on the fourth floor of the library.” Ultimately, sex is culturally defined by the presence of a penis, or at least some form of penetration, and this is just wrong.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

We often miss out on having those stories about our “first time,” because no one ever talks about what that would even look like. One of the things I heard about while I was growing up was “scissoring,” and I thought, “So, are we just supposed to smash our labia together until we both come in one simultaneous moment of bliss?” No, young Anabel, nobody does that. The next thing you might learn is that lesbians lose their virginity when they are eaten out. This sounds great, except men can eat out girls as well, so why are straight women who have only been eaten out still considered virgins?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s almost as if we’re agreeing that gay women really only get half the experience that straight women get, and as someone who has had sex with both men and women, that just doesn’t feel like the truth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what’s next? The strap-on. If you have just been fucked with a strap-on for the first time, most people would argue you have lost your virginity. But what about the person who wore it? I doubt that many people would consider that a loss of virginity for the giver. Truth be told, I don’t know how queer women lose their virginity with the cultural definition we currently hold, and that’s why the definition must change.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If my intimate experiences with my girlfriend are not sex, then neither is your “in and out three times on the fourth floor of the library.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stated earlier that losing your virginity is defined by the first time a person has sex. This implies that in order to understand what that means, we must first decide what it means to have sex. My definition of sex is that it must be a consensual, intimate, vulnerable and, of course, sexual act. That’s it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of my straight friends, after having sex for the first time, reported that they didn’t feel any different. I myself reported the same thing after having sex with a man. This is probably because we had already had milestone-like experiences that were consensual, intimate, vulnerable and sexual that did make us feel different or changed. At least, I know this is the case for myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can pinpoint a couple times when I actually felt like I lost my virginity that don’t match the classic definition. It wasn’t the first time I had sex with a man, or the first time a girl ate me out, or even the first time I was fucked with a strap-on. I would say I lost my virginity the first time my girlfriend saw me naked and I felt my most vulnerable — but also my most beautiful. I could also say it was the first time I gave my girlfriend an orgasm, even if it was only with my hands. I could even argue that with each new partner I am losing my virginity over and over again, because I am learning to be vulnerable with someone new — just like how every kiss with a new person feels like my first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your moment is, the point is that it doesn’t matter. Sex is whatever it feels like it should be to you and your partner. Plus, virginity is made up anyway, so who really cares?       </span></p>\n<p><em>Anabel Costa wants Gauchos to define their own intimate experiences as they see fit.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.
