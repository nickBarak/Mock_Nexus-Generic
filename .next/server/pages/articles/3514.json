In addition to those seven students, 12 other students were expected to study abroad in Hong Kong in the spring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said there were originally 90 students scheduled to go to Hong Kong in the fall, but after UCEAP offered them the option to switch programs or postpone their studies abroad due to the protests, 11 students chose to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been monitoring the situation since the summer,” Nyitray said. “So this wasn’t a decision that was either made lightly or out of any kind of haste or panic.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As the protests again continued to escalate further, and the response has been so unexpectedly strong from the police, with people being shot at with live ammunition, we felt that we really needed to evaluate this very, very carefully,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said the program’s first priority was ensuring the safety of UC students who are currently in Hong Kong, all of whom are attending one of three schools: University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong or Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Two out of our three partners [University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong] are now actually sites of protests and violence, and the faculty and staff are having difficulty getting to campus if they live at any distance because of the transit systems being shut down,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-students.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=fb-nytimes&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ns3WNd1rmpfZ_NDQBZQI4oY-yHNZkQC9rWNLSD_2JqDKVaRf8RZeXIZw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Wednesday that police in Hong Kong had begun “raiding the edges of the biggest campuses to make arrests.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday night, police officers and students clashed near the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong; “police officers fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets and students hurled Molotov cocktails and bricks, and practiced firing bows with flaming arrows,” according to the Times.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray said that while it hasn’t reached the point where UCEAP will “actively evacuate” students currently in Hong Kong, students have been given the option to end their programs early and return home. UCEAP and its partner universities in Hong Kong have been working with students to ensure they will receive course credit for their terms, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She explained that as the protests escalated, there were “a number of [non-UC universities] who didn’t send students this fall at all,” while others have now “pulled [students] back and have simply told them ‘you must come back now.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But because the UCEAP program is unusual in that it has such a large number of students, “we really wanted to not just jump in, we wanted to really assess the situation and give the students optimal chance to remain, to have the academic experience that they wanted to have, before we pulled out,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also added that if students were sent to Hong Kong in the spring and had to be evacuated, they might not be able to receive credit for the classes they were taking or be able to enroll in time at their home campuses for the quarter or semester. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re trying to balance the academic and the financial consequences for the students, you know, we don’t want any of the students to suffer at all,” Nyitray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCEAP has not determined if they will suspend the Hong Kong summer abroad programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just so unclear — it’s unclear to our partners, it’s unclear to us,” Nyitray said. “We’ve been monitoring the State Department updates every day, and we have been monitoring local news, not only the foreign news, but local news, and of course we have our partners on the ground.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nyitray noted that the State Department security level for Hong Kong is level two, or “exercise increased caution,” which she said was the same security level as most of Western Europe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With the violence and the protests having moved to the campuses themselves, we feel that the situation warranted extra caution.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Regents of the University of California, et al. — has worked its way through the federal court system and is a combination of the University of California (UC) case as well as similar DACA cases in the District of Columbia and New York. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was created by an executive order under former President Barack Obama in 2012. The program provides two-year repeated deferments from deportation and a work permit to individuals who arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.uscis.gov/archive/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB74r7NE0A7btCgQX8od_5u0oogA\">website</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The legal battle began in September 2017 when acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607871000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDw312g5cu8l9yoc1brbCBOrktxw\">announced</a> the Trump administration was ending the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just three days after the decision to end DACA was announced, the UC filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, becoming the “first university board to sue the government,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-filing-amicus-briefs-support-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607874000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcVJLBEAIOAKsdIDfspxkSgAjUuw\">press release</a> from the UC Office of the President (UCOP). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit puts UC President Janet Napolitano in a unique position. As president, her office is leading the fight nationwide to protect DACA — the signature legislation she helped create in 2012 as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security for the Obama administration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Neither I, nor the University of California, take the step of suing the federal government lightly, especially not the very agency that I led,” Napolitano said. “To arbitrarily and capriciously end the DACA program, which benefits our country as a whole, is not only unlawful, it is contrary to our national values and bad policy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are nearly 700,000 DACA recipients currently in the program, which includes “approximately 1,700 UC students,” according to UCOP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC-DACA-Complaint.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607872000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbbp7en5OHiiYOlbelFwnekcqrXg\">lawsuit</a> alleges the Trump administration rescinded the program on “nothing more than unreasoned executive whim,” and that its removal is “unconstitutional, unjust, and unlawful.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal court granted an injunction to temporarily stop the Department of Homeland Security’s recission of DACA in January 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an unusual attempt, President Trump tried to bypass the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s hearing of the case, moving directly to the U.S. Supreme Court — but the justices denied his appeal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case went on as scheduled to the Ninth Circuit, and in November of 2018, the court ruled in favor of the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last June, the Supreme Court announced it would hear the DACA case in November 2019, beginning oral arguments this upcoming Tuesday, with expectations to have a decision in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case presents two specific questions: whether it is up to the courts to decide DACA’s fate, and if so, whether the decision to rescind the DACA program was “arbitrary and capricious.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is no dispute that this decision has life-changing implications for nearly 700,000 DACA participants and their families,” the Regent’s briefing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/20190927151220415_18-587-Regents-Brief-for-Respondents.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607878000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEj-h4CmfaWS_4hT0IjEYZhwmfjMg\">reads</a>. “Yet the Acting Secretary provided only a single vague sentence of explanation for the decision that leaves basic questions unanswered.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-president-janet-napolitano-filing-supreme-court-brief-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzPIBYHwjcOkR8r6nf7IsxddiKjQ\">statement</a> released in September, Napolitano argued that the Trump administration acted illegally because it offered no “valid justification” for ending the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Five federal courts have considered this issue and found that the administration’s decision was arbitrary and capricious, and therefore unlawful,” Napolitano said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court briefing mentioned that the administration waited seven months to end the program and that Trump had previously indicated he “would allow DREAMers to stay.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Department of Homeland Security argued that DACA is illegal because it is a violation of immigration law and was enacted not through Congress, but as an executive order under former President Obama. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[DACA] was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action,

Strauss Foundation, a program that funds public service projects, in hopes of starting such an organization on campus. After learning about the OTI’s similar goals through a student leader summit on the issue, Ofer and fellow Gaucho Saleh Abdulla — at the time the co-president of the Muslim Student Association — helped bring OTI to the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>“When we presented our initial idea around the university, our kind of thing was: an ex-Israeli Defense Force soldier and a Yemeni Muslim … and co-president of the Muslim Student Association are trying to work together to bring this incredible experience to other UCSB students and to the UCSB community,” Ofer said.</p>\n<p>According to Ofer, OTI stepped in to provide a “middle ground” between some of the viewpoints on campus.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t want the conflict to be perpetuated on our campus,” Ofer said. “There’s enough conflict going around and as students, we are going to be making the policy in the future … It is really important that we are educated on these issues so we can make positive influences when we are in those positions.”</p>\n<p>Over the summer of 2010, Ofer and fellow UCSB student Omer Harari traveled with OTI to the Middle East. Last summer, Co-Presidents Atapour and Medovoy, together with Mousa and graduate advisor Mike Schwartz, doubled the previous number of UCSB delegates to the Olive Tree Initiative and are currently active in the growing organization on campus.</p>\n<p><em>This is the second of three installments of the feature titled The Olive Tree Initiative.
