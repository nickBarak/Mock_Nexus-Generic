There, he helped to facilitate the Central Coast’s first-ever cannabis community and grew a passion for connecting with growers, testifying in court for cannabis regulations and fostering the local cannabis community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Spring Quarter 2019, he was approached by the president of UC Los Angeles’ (UCLA) Cannaclub, who reached out to encourage him to start his own chapter at UC Santa Barbara.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The president] said, ‘Zain, you go to UCSB, why don’t you empower the student voice, why don’t you give the students a voice in the [cannabis] community?’” Qureshi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t know whether there’s going to be a big interest in [the club]. I didn’t know because I was working with professionals in the field for so long. Students were kind of out of the picture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi created the club that same quarter, which he said was a straightforward process because UCLA’s Cannaclub had already given him all the tools necessary to replicate it at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi’s next step after forming the club was to register it through the Office of Student Life, which he said wasn’t a problem because “[we] weren’t promoting sales, consumption or distribution. It was purely educational.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After registering the club, Qureshi said he pooled some friends together to form Cannaclub’s first executive board. Combined with his past experience in the cannabis industry, he said getting the club off its feet “wasn’t really a problem.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We threw our first event on cannabis and mental health last spring. That was an incredibly informative, hard-opening panel,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a really good turnout too, which was awesome because I couldn’t gauge the interest of the school, but when so many people showed up, I was like, ‘Hey, this is real, you know, like people are actually interested in it,’” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But come Fall Quarter 2019, Cannaclub went dormant when Qureshi left for the quarter to study abroad. After returning for winter quarter, he said he focused his efforts on bringing the club back to life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, he said he has a stronger executive team and more people “who are focused on being interested in joining the cannabis industry after college,” which enables the club to work toward one of its central pillars: community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi said he also hopes to inform students about the cannabis industry, create awareness and destigmatize the use of cannabis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the [club’s] pillars is to give people the right tools. Another pillar was to create a more informed, healthier and more conscious community. Statistically speaking, Gauchos are some of the biggest stoners,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I took that and I was like, ‘Okay, do people really know what they’re smoking? Do they even know what they’re buying?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locally based cannabis companies — such as Hemp Blank, Green Rush Alliance and Delta Leaf Laboratories — have helped Cannaclub expand by providing the club with resources, speakers and apparel</span>, all of which have contributed to the club’s main goals of education, awareness and entrepreneurship, Qureshi said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, Qureshi envisions Cannaclub as a space where members can attend biweekly meetings and mingle with professionals within the cannabis industry while receiving educational sessions and tours throughout Santa Barbara’s cannabis scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, he has been focused on two things — creating different committees within the club and advertising through social media for upcoming events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of January, Cannaclub held an event called “Cannabis and Science,” where a handful of speakers gave talks to students in I.V. Theater about the dangers of vaping, cannabis technological innovations and plant genetics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later this month, Qureshi hopes to host another event, this time for networking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My vision is to throw something at the end of this month that focuses on networking for students at UCSB and students at SBCC,” Qureshi said. “[It will be at] at a venue downtown where we’ll bring out a lot of companies from the cannabis space, from sustainability to delivery to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he’ll soon be leaving UCSB for a career in the cannabis industry, Qureshi hopes that Cannaclub is here to stay. Although the club’s presence on campus is still relatively small, Qureshi is confident that Cannalub will continue to grow over time — as long as the club doesn’t sway from its goal of bringing students together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m trying to build a community, that’s all it is. I want people of all different majors. It doesn’t matter who you are or whatever you’re interested in,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a place for you.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3</em><em> of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Office of the President and UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force, aimed to address student needs through an open discussion facilitated by university administration and mental health specialists, followed by a Q&amp;A portion and discussion groups. The event concluded with a brief tour of campus resources at different tables. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With this structure for the town hall, we hope to provide a forum where members of the UCSB community can easily and safely voice their concerns and be a valuable part of the process to improve our campus climate on mental health,” Sejal Anuraji, mental health coordinator for the A.S. Office of the President, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current climate and stigma around mental health at UCSB was examined in detail to help service providers understand where they needed to fill in the gaps, according to A.S. President Alison Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students argued at the town hall that UCSB should be focused on making mental health services more visible to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mental health affects students’ everyday lives … from academic success to relationships to self-care and I hope to see more advertisement of the resources available,” Anna Talamantes, a fourth-year biopsychology major, said in a discussion group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A variety of UCSB mental health services were represented at the town hall, including  leadership and mental health professionals from Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force, members of the A.S. Office of the President and other university administration members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharleen O’Brien, director of the Mental Health Task Force, said the event was organized with the intention of introducing the student body to the task force and making them aware of its role on campus. O’Brien described the Mental Health Task Force as centered around three main goals: mobilizing additional campus resources, increasing visibility and accessibility of services and gaining feedback from students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mental Health Task Force was introduced by O’Brien as a new coalition for change, at the beginning of the event. O’Brien further identified members of the task force in the room and explained their purpose.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Mental Health Task Force was constituted to work on better coordination among campus services and to develop enhanced communication that makes it more clear to students, faculty and staff how to access services and what resources are provided through each department,” Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, said at the town hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the “fishbowl” discussion portion among several UCSB staff members and students, they highlighted key obstacles and discussed where these issues stem from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wait times for C.A.P.S. services are one of the biggest obstacles for students to receive care, according to Brian Olowude, director of C.A.P.S. Students are often discouraged by the waiting period between appointments, and there is currently a struggle to determine the best way to solve this issue without compromising quality care, Olowude said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude added it has also been a challenge to learn how to effectively educate students about other campus mental health services besides C.A.P.S. — such as C.A.R.E and the UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program — that may better fit their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several campus organizations also had the opportunity to table at the event and answer attendees’ questions. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E.) was one such organization, which sought to increase its visibility and presence in the mental health conversation at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many survivors don’t know that C.A.R.E. is not just about advocacy — it’s also very much focused on overall student mental health and well-being,” Shalmali Patil, a C.A.R.E peer educator and third-year psychological and brain sciences and statistics and data science double major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students also discussed intersectionality in relation to mental health, voicing concerns about finding resources that are accessible to their unique communities and people who understand the particular issues they might encounter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are often certain obstacles and challenges faced uniquely by minority communities. I also hope to see a more accessible and clear directory showing which resources are available to students for a variety of different issues,” Sir said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The climate crisis was another growing area of concern that can impact mental well-being, Julia Fine, a doctoral student in linguistics, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our studies indicate that high levels of concern, anxiety, anger and grief are all connected to the climate crisis … [so we are] interested in how we can use the resources on campus to support student climate activists,” Fine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said a follow-up to the town hall is scheduled to take place sometime in the near future and said that she hopes that the follow-up will help establish tangible change to campus resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope this can be an ongoing event for years to come so that we can continue to provide a platform for the community to give their input and conduct a friendly check-in on the state of UCSB’s student resources.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [2/07/2020, 3:55 p.m.]: A previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Shalmali Patil is a third-year psychological and brain science major. She is a C.A.R.E. peer educator who is double majoring in psychological and brain science and statistics and data science. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

adjustment, known commonly as a COLA, of $1,807.51, a number that they pinpointed from surveying nearly 1,000 UCSB graduate students. As of </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fall Quarter 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there are 2,965 masters and doctoral students enrolled at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students also used data from a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NBEURM2U-Fe58aA5noiETsiBpiqBfvqemNDio_jAY-c/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the cost of living for graduate students compiled by the UC Student-Workers Union (UAW 2865), which represents graduate students across the UC, to calculate the exact COLA amount. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s march for a cost-of-living adjustment was part of a larger movement across the UC; the movement is spearheaded by UC Santa Cruz, as UCSC graduate students began a </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/payusmoreucsc/status/1226910373388812289\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wildcat strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – meaning a strike not authorized by their union – Monday morning, indefinitely halting office hours, sections and grading. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC San Diego, UC Los Angeles and UC Davis graduate students also held rallies yesterday in support of a COLA at their respective universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The presentation of official </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tNp5CgwjPmu4NQWnbTgSQaB3Kxsr_ZOHe9e7DYMwrHI/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> marks a turning point for the UCSB COLA movement. Graduate students have been organizing the demands since Jan. 21, when students held a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“sick-out”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of UCSC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily, a first-year sociology graduate student who declined to give her last name, spoke to the crowd at the University Library on Monday about how the list of demands was created, noting that it was important that as many graduate student voices as possible were included. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We read all the comments on the 994 surveys we got, we took it into consideration, we wrote these and this is what we came up with,” Emily told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All campuses across UC are organizing in some way for this COLA, and that’s how we’re going to get strength and prove to the administration that something’s got to change if we stand together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lex Taylor, a third-year political science and economics major, also spoke to the crowd in front of the library, representing a handful of undergraduate students who marched in solidarity with graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are mostly taught by grad students. These are the people making sure this university is working … that we are going into our classes getting the education we deserve,” Taylor said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taylor also referenced the three-year long </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strike efforts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union as a sign that COLA efforts can be successful too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME, for the last three years, striked on and off, and they won. Right now at Santa Cruz, grad students are starting to strike, we are about to give our demands all across the UCs and grad students are showing what they can do,” Taylor added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Emily read the demands aloud and several graduate students spoke regarding the need for COLA, the group marched from the University Library to the fifth floor of Cheadle Hall, where students presented the list of demands to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond asking for a COLA, the students’ demands included several stipulations: that the COLA amount will be recalculated annually to account for increases in housing costs, that a COLA will not come from an increase in graduate or undergraduate tuition, that the university will not retaliate in any form against those supporting or participating in the demand for a COLA and that the university will accommodate the higher financial needs of graduate students with children or dependent adults.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand letter also highlighted the COLA’s necessity and explained that the amount comes from calculating average graduate student income and housing costs in the local area, to determine what amount is necessary per month to keep graduate students from rent burden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter explained that the baseline for a rent burden is 31%, meaning that 31% or more of an individual’s income goes towards housing. However, the average rent burden for graduate students at UCSB is 51%, as calculated by UAW 2865.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stipend necessary to alleviate rent burden at UCSB is the fourth-highest stipend estimate in the UC system, behind Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Los Angeles, according to the UAW report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students earn their income from a variety of different funding sources, such as fellowships, grants, teaching assistant positions and research. Because sources of income vary from student to student and may change on a quarterly basis, UCSB graduate students emphasized in the demands letter that they are asking for a cost-of-living adjustment that is dispersed each month through the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All UCSB graduate students, “regardless of their graduate program, department, year in program, residence, visa category, documentation, funding source, and employment status,” will receive the same COLA amount, according to demands.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email statement, UC Office of the President Associate Director for Media Relations Andrew Gordon stated that the strike at UCSC is “illegal,” adding that it “does not further the discussion on how to increase housing affordability for student employees.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon explained that the university reached a four-year contract with UAW in August 2018 and that the contract is in place through June 2020. He said that “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">while the University does not plan to reopen the signed and ratified contract with UAW, we did recently hold a meeting to discuss legitimate student concerns regarding housing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC appreciates the information provided by the UAW and the ongoing dialogue regarding affordable housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the demands have been released to the university, UCSB graduate students will move forward with increasing awareness around the push for a COLA and negotiating with the university, with no plans in the works for a strike, according to multiple graduate students at previous COLA meetings.</span></p>\n<p>Additional photos and coverage of the strike can be viewed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1226971585468358657\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/in-photos-ucsb-graduate-students-present-cola-demands-amidst-uc-wide-rallies/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
