We can’t grind away like we did in the first two years. That’s not our team identity and personality this year. I like to score. When we can score and shut people down on the defensive end of things, we’ll be a pretty good team.”</p>\n<p>The team that ranked last in the Big West last year in points per game, at 51.3, used a high-pace offense and the fast break to tie the second-highest point total during the Carlene Mitchell era, scoring 76 points. The new run-and-gun style led to easy buckets as Santa Barbara shot an incredible 50.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“We want to push the ball more because we feel like we’re conditioned,” sophomore forward Kendra Morrison said. “Our guards are stealing the ball higher up on the court, so it’s easier to get transition layups.”</p>\n<p>Ironically, in UCSB’s first home game of the year, the Gauchos got off to an extremely slow start offensively, scoring just nine points in the first nine minutes of the game. However, once Santa Barbara caught fire, there was no looking back.</p>\n<p>In typical Gaucho fashion, UCSB used its defense to fuel its offense. With just under eight minutes remaining, Santa Barbara’s full-court press resulted in a 10-second backcourt violation by Occidental. A minute later, a steal by freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe led to two free throws, sparking a 14-0 spurt by the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Our defense got us pumped up,” sophomore guard Jasmine Ware, who tallied four steals, said. “There was a lot of intensity when we were pressing. It just really got us going and helped the flow of the offense as well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the half on a 22-8 run to take a comfortable 39-26 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>Despite having only nine players on the roster, UCSB showed no signs of tiring entering the second half as it continued to get out on the break and beat its opponent down the court. The Gauchos started the second half on a 17-2 run, led by senior guard Destini Mason, who scored eight of her career-high 16 points during the run.</p>\n<p>With 11:31 to go, Santa Barbara held a 26-point lead, its largest of the game, scoring 55 points in the previous 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>“Overall, I was extremely proud of the effort,” Mitchell said. “There were three- and four-minute spurts where we were really good.”</p>\n<p>Three players finished in double-figures for UCSB. Along with Mason’s 16 points, Ware tallied a career-high 12 points. Leading the way offensively was senior guard Nicole Nesbit, who played a complete game with 17 points, six assists, six rebounds and three steals.</p>\n<p>“Nic’s growth has just been tremendous, from her sophomore year when she came off the bench, to last year leading the team from the point and in the scoring position,” Mitchell said. “Now, [she’s] being asked to score, lead, sometimes run the point, sometimes move to the two spot, and I think she’s also taken into heart to be a great defender.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also won the assist category at 17-8 and out-rebounded the Tigers 43-26, a crucial element for an undersized Santa Barbara squad that wants to run.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be back in action next Saturday when it completes a three-game home stand against Pac-12 opponent University of Arizona.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>In addition, after losing its entire starting frontline to graduation, Santa Barbara will feature a much smaller lineup this year, with only two forwards and one center on the roster.</p>\n<p>If any players will look familiar, it will be the guards as UCSB’s trio of seniors will be the leaders of this year’s team.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be obvious with anyone we play we’re going to be undersized,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “But we have an experienced group of guards and they’ve worked extremely hard and it’s their third year in our system.”</p>\n<p>With a new team comes a new style of play, especially on the offensive end. While the Gauchos finished last in the Big West in scoring offense last season at 51.3 points per game, a fast-paced, run-and-gun offense will complement the smaller lineup and the Gauchos will try to spread the floor with guards that can score in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p>“I’ll make the adjustment that we’ll have to get up and down,” Mitchell said. “I think in the past, it was in our benefit to find ways to grind it out, but with this team we’re going to have to keep it pretty simple and spread people out because we have to take advantage of our strengths, which is quickness.”</p>\n<p>However, one thing that won’t change under Mitchell’s control is the focus on defense. The coach that has led Santa Barbara to the postseason in her first two years at UCSB will look to up the defensive intensity, implementing a high-pressure press.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Gauchos topped the conference and ranked 20th in the nation in points allowed per game at 52.9 and opponent field goal percentage at 36.2 percent.</p>\n<p>“We know we have to press a lot more,” Mitchell said. “I think it’ll be to our benefit to speed people up and get easy baskets. Hopefully, we’ll get teams into some shot clock issues with our [press]. Now, we can get more aggressive on the ball and in the passing lanes.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was picked to finish fifth in the Big West Preseason Poll behind Cal Poly, Hawaii, Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“I think we have the chance to be a very good team and hopefully that will be sooner rather than later,” Mitchell said. “Northridge tended to play that same style: quick, small and athletic. That’s probably going to be more of our personality this year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Guards</p>\n<p>#1 Kristine Brance (junior)</p>\n<p>Brance may be new to UCSB, but she’s not lacking any experience. The Latvia native transfers to Santa Barbara after playing two years at the nationally ranked Chipola College in Florida, where she led her team in scoring, averaging 14.2 points per game. She shot 39 percent from the field and an incredible 36 percent from three point range. Bringing toughness from her experience, knowledge of how to win, as well as the European style to UCSB, Brance will be critical in providing an offensive spark, especially from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>#2 Jasmine Ware (sophomore)</p>\n<p>In her first season at UCSB, Ware showed her potential to fit into Mitchell’s system, proving to be an effective defensive stopper. In her 11.4 minutes per game last year, she averaged 0.5 steals per contest. This year, as a taller guard at 5’10’’, Ware could help the Gauchos offensively too, as she has a smooth shot from 15 to 17 feet. Mitchell even described her midrange game as “second to none on this team.” Plus, needing to play small and push the ball should play right into Ware’s strengths.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#3 Nicole Nesbit (senior)</p>\n<p>One of the three key seniors this season, Nesbit is a two-time All-Big West honorable mention selection. As the floor general last season, she ranked third in minutes at 29.5 per game, second in points per game at 10.5, second in steals per game at 0.8 and led the team in assists per game at 2.8. This season, Nesbit will move over to the shooting guard where she can use her scoring instinct and speed to either get to the basket or rise up for the jumper off the dribble. And the more she can get to the rim, the better because last season she led the team in free throw percentage at an impressive 87.5 percent. According to Mitchell, “we haven’t seen Nic’s best game yet.” She is certainly capable of averaging double digits every night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#10 Onome Jemerigbe (freshman)</p>\n<p>The player allowing Nesbit to slide over to the shooting guard is Jemerigbe. Coming from a great high school team in St. Mary’s High, Mitchell compared her young point guard to Shannon Bobbitt from Tennessee. Giving the Gauchos a different type of point guard, Jemerigbe has a pass first mentality. Lightning quick, she has the lateral foot speed that UCSB has lacked the last few years, which will allow Santa Barbara to hound the opponent’s ball handler and help in transition defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#22 Melissa Zornig (senior)</p>\n<p>The second of the trio of seniors, Zornig is another offensive threat for UCSB. She has the ability to score in a variety of ways, averaging 8.0 points per game and 81 percent shooting from the charity stripe last season. However, Zornig can certainly average double-figures this year, as shown by her career-high 24 points against UC Davis last season. Next to Brance, Zornig will form a duo of three-point threats as she led the team in three-point percentage last year at 32.5 percent. She also averaged 2.2 assists last year and led the team in assist to turnover ratio, exemplifying her high basketball I.Q. As the “most consistent player right now” according to Mitchell, Zornig will be a big part of the team and a leader for Santa Barbara this upcoming season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#33 Destini Mason (senior)</p>\n<p>Rounding out the trio of seniors is Mason, who is known as the athletic defensive stopper for the Gauchos. Described by Mitchell as even “light-years better than last year,” Mason has stepped up as the vocal leader for UCSB. Ranking second on the team in three-point percentage last year at 28.0 percent and third on the team in rebounding, but the top rebounding guard, at 3.8 per game, Mason is an exceptionally versatile player. Like Angelei Aguirre from last season, Mason will be asked to play a lot of minutes in lots of positions, anywhere from one through four.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forwards</p>\n<p>#13 Kendra Morrison (sophomore)</p>\n<p>Morrison only played 5.8 minutes per game last year, but when she did find time on the court, she took advantage, shooting 43.8 percent from the field. Showing what she could do last year against USC where she totaled 11 points on 5-5 shooting, Morrison should expect more minutes this season with the lack of depth at the forward position. With a high basketball I.Q. and the ability to open up the offense because she is a stronger body who can also knock down the three, it could be a breakout season for Morrison.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#34 Mi’Chael Wright (freshman)</p>\n<p>In high school, Wright averaged 12.7 points and 9.4 rebounds. Now here at UCSB, Wright is a blue-collar player with a knack for rebounding, which will be critical for the Gauchos because if they’re going to play a faster style, they have to be able to rebound. Described by Mitchell to be like Charles Barkley or a more offensively- minded Aguirre from last season, Wright has the ability to put up 10-12 points a night simply on hustle and her notable basketball I.Q.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Center</p>\n<p>#12 Melissa Maragnes (freshman)</p>\n<p>At 6’2’’, Maragnes will be the tallest player on the UCSB roster this season and be responsible for guarding the opponent’s center. At St. Monica High School, she averaged 9.9 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game, setting the school’s block record at 60. As an amazing athlete who Mitchell says plays “almost above the rim,” Maragnes has the potential of becoming a big-time player for Santa Barbara in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of October 30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Ramon Rovirosa</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52675\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-30/new-year-new-faces-new-style/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52675\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-30/new-year-new-faces-new-style/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-30/new-year-new-faces-new-style/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-30/new-year-new-faces-new-style/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-30/new-year-new-faces-new-style/","id":604,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[603,602,601],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Big West Contender","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_20251.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_20251.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB men's basketball season preview","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As the third youngest team in the nation last season, the UCSB men’s basketball team underwent some growing pains en route to a first round exit in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>This season, however, has a chance to be special as UCSB aims to return to the top of the conference.

Williams finished first in the league in rebounds, second in blocks and fourth in points per game, garnering him All Big West First Team honors.</p>\n<p>“Alan is probably the best player in the Big West. He averaged a double-double last year. You can’t argue with that,” senior guard Kyle Boswell said. “He’s a load down low and we’re going to be feeding him. If you guard him single handedly, he’s going to definitely dominate you down low.”</p>\n<p>Williams was once again selected to the preseason All-Conference team and will be one of the most dominant low post players in the entire country let alone the Big West.</p>\n<p>“He’s crucial for us, he’s got to score on the block, he’s got to be a dynamic rebounder, he’s got to be a guy that draws fouls and makes free throws. And we know he will do that,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We believe he’ll average a double-double. If Al doesn’t average 18 and 12 I’ll be surprised.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sam Beeler &amp; Mitch Brewe</p>\n<p>These pair of sophomore forwards will play behind Big Al down low. Each showed promise last season filling in for Williams during injury or foul trouble and project to remain equally involved this season as the sole post players expected to play behind Big Al this season.</p>\n<p>“The big thing with them from last year to this year is their confidence,” Boswell said. “They’re playing a lot more confidently and that happens a lot after your freshman year. They’re playing really well, they’re going to have great contributions down low and we’re going to need them too.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wings/Forwards</p>\n<p>Kyle Boswell</p>\n<p>The reigning Big West Sixth Man of the Year returns as talented a shooter as ever. Boswell averaged 13 points per game last season and finished fourth in the conference with a .419 shooting percentage from beyond the arc. Only one of two seniors, Boswell will once again reprise the role as both a leader in the locker room and the first man off the bench.</p>\n<p>“He’s a great player, a great leader and it seems like he puts in every shot he puts up,” Big Al said. “Having a spark off the bench is always great, especially when you have a guy who can put up 20 points off the bench. That’s really valuable to us.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Taran Brown</p>\n<p>Brown finished last season with the all-time record for three-pointers made by a freshman in Gaucho history. The sophomore forward averaged 11.1 points and 5.3 rebounds per game and will once again provide a scoring threat both on the wing and down low with his 6’8” frame.</p>\n<p>“Taran is the most athletic player on our team,” Boswell said. “The thing with Taran is he has to play under control and play on balance. His talent level is tremendous so it’s about him making smart plays on the court.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Michael Bryson</p>\n<p>The sophomore guard finished off last season with tremendous play, scoring a UCSB freshman record 29 points in the first round of the Big West Tournament. Bryson averaged 8.4 points per game last season, a number that increased to over 12.7 per game over the final 12 contests of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>John Green</p>\n<p>Expected to be one of the dominant scorers for UCSB the last two seasons, Green has played in only one game during his college career due to foot injuries. Healthy entering this season, the sophomore guard will be a major addition for Santa Barbara and is projected to be one of its leading scorers.</p>\n<p>“He’s a big time difference maker,” Big Al said. “He can go out there and score the ball; he can post up the little guards, and take the big guys out towards the perimeter. He’s a great shooter and a really great leader, so he will help us a lot.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Shawn Moore</p>\n<p>The senior forward provided valuable minutes as a role player and walk-on last season, starting the final six games of the regular season for UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Aamahd Walker</p>\n<p>Walker sat out last season plagued by injury, but the redshirt freshman guard may certainly contribute this season as an athletic shooting guard off the bench.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Point Guards</p>\n<p>Zalmico Harmon</p>\n<p>A junior transfer from Ventura College, Harmon is expected to take over the starting point guard role for UCSB this season after T.J. Taylor underwent hip surgery in the offseason. Harmon averaged nearly 16 points and six assists for Ventura last season and plays much bigger than his 6”, 185 pound frame.</p>\n<p>“[Zalmico] is an absolute tank,” Boswell said. “He’s already played in prep school and two years in junior college, so he has a lot of experience under his belt.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eric Childress</p>\n<p>One of two true freshmen for UCSB this season, Childress is expected to compete with Harmon for the starting point spot this season after averaging over 16 points, four assists and 5.6 rebounds per game as a senior in high school.</p>\n<p>“Our point guard position with [Eric and Zalmico] has been very solid,” Coach Williams said. “They’re tough, they defend, they’re good with [the ball]. I like their decision making skills. [Eric] has really come a long way; he’s making very good decisions.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Duke DaRe</p>\n<p>The sophomore walk-on played solid defense for UCSB last season and averaged nearly 12 minutes per game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Depth is certainly not an issue for the Gauchos this season, and with all the hard work put in during the offseason for UCSB, it is no stretch to think the Big West title may once again reside in Santa Barbara come seasons end.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re capable of winning the league and I think we’re capable of winning the Big West tournament at the end of the year,” Coach Williams said. “We’ve got the pieces if we can stay healthy and keep growing.

In need of a trey, UCSB’s top three-point threat, junior guard Kristine Brance, lined up a three, but it was blocked, giving Vanguard its first exhibition win in four tries this season.</p>\n<p>“It was just a sense of urgency,” senior guard Destini Mason asid about Santa Barbara’s comeback. “We realized we were down by a lot and we started to get more stops and that’s what we talked about at halftime, that we have to play defense.”</p>\n<p>Up until the final push, UCSB looked like a team in its first game of the season. Overall, the Gauchos allowed Vanguard to shoot 49.0 percent from the field, including 41.2 percent from three point range, numbers very uncharacteristic for a UCSB squad that has led the Big West in scoring defense the last two seasons.</p>\n<p>Leading the Lions offensively were Ballestero and sophomore forward Samantha Doucette, who moved through UCSB’s defense with ease, scoring 24 and 16 points respectively.</p>\n<p>Entering the second half with a 33-27 lead, the Lions began the second half the same way they started the game, making a quick push to put Santa Barbara in a hole. Jumping out to a 14-4 lead, Vanguard earned its largest lead of the game at 47-31 with just less than 15 minutes to go.</p>\n<p>Taking 35 minutes to shake the rust, UCSB finally came alive. Staying true to what has won them ball games in the past, they picked up their defensive intensity which also fueled the team’s offense.</p>\n<p>“We started to pick up our defense more in the second half, and I think that led to more transition,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We were able to get out and run and not have to play in the half court and run set offenses.”</p>\n<p>Despite the loss, the Gauchos did see offensive contributions from everyone on the roster. With a constantly rotating lineup, all nine players tallied at least two points for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We had great minutes from Christine Brance and Onome was wonderful,” Mitchell said. “She allows [Nesbit] to settle into that two spot and be free to shoot the basketball.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit led the way with 15 points for the Gauchos, one of three players in double-figures. She also tallied seven rebounds and six assists, both team-highs for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play its first official game of the season Sunday at home against Occidental.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/gauchos-fall-to-lions-in-exhibition-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/gauchos-fall-to-lions-in-exhibition-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/gauchos-fall-to-lions-in-exhibition-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/gauchos-fall-to-lions-in-exhibition-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/gauchos-fall-to-lions-in-exhibition-game/","id":606,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[605,604,603],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
