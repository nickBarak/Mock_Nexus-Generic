Community Services District (CSD) board president who led the march, said he saw the parade as a glimpse into the future of what Deltopia could be.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that everyone appreciated, and it was all fun, all positive,” he said. “That got me thinking, ‘Hey, if there’s more planned programming, I think that’s really the first step toward a ‘sanctioned Deltopia.’”</p>\n<p>Bertrand and other I.V. stakeholders have, for the past few years, proposed the idea of making Deltopia a sanctioned event. Rather than having the informal Spring Break celebration, they hope that someday Deltopia could be a planned festival of sorts — one with alcohol vending, booked performances or perhaps more Mardi Gras marches.</p>\n<p>“I think that it will be really important for us moving forward instead of just trying to see Deltopia as a problem we can put a Band-Aid on from a law enforcement perspective,” said Spencer Brandt, who also serves as a director on the CSD board.</p>\n<p>UCPD sent in approximately 70 officers into I.V. this weekend, the lowest in recent years, considering that police have had as many as 300 officers in town during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“We need to be doing what we can to bring it out into the open and regulate it,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Brandt said he envisions a Deltopia where organizers are “distributing wristbands, having music in the parks [and] selling alcohol out in an open place where it is regulated and we know who is able to purchase it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76839\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76839\" data-attachment-id=\"76839\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-11/in-photos-deltopia-weekend-2017/deltopia-by-mclane/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deltopia by McLane\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-76839 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopia-by-McLane.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76839\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some on the I.V.

Officers arrested over 100 residents, according to police estimates.</p>\n<p>The riots led to broad discussion of the possibility of instituting a sanctioned Deltopia. Abboud said it was a primary issue in the last quarter of his A.S. presidency.</p>\n<p>“This was actually a very, very widely popular, talked-about issue in the few weeks following the riots,” he said. “[We thought,] let’s sanction it and make it work, you know? For the benefit for the community.”</p>\n<p>The idea lost momentum in A.S., however, at the occurrence of the May 23, 2014, shooting, Abboud said.</p>\n<p>While no stakeholders have officially sanctioned a Deltopia festival, UCSB student groups have developed programming around the informal celebration in efforts to increase the safety of students during the weekend.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board has, for the past three years, hosted an on-campus concert called The Warm Up, and the A.S. Public Safety Commission started a volunteer program called UC Isla Vista (UCIV) in 2015 in which students act as mediators between residents and police.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76921\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76921\" data-attachment-id=\"76921\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/wristbands-booked-bands-and-booze-stands-i-v-stakeholders-push-for-a-sanctioned-deltopia/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"deltopiaextra – mclanebrown\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-76921\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/deltopiaextra-mclanebrown.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A sanctioned Deltopia could mean one with alcohol vendors, booked musical performances and Mardi Gras-like marches.

One of the students died after being rushed to the hospital.</p>\n<p>While this incident is not considered a mass shooting, which is defined as a shooting where four or more people are killed by a firearm, Martinez said he believes it is similar to many mass shootings in the country because it was calculated and included the shooter committing suicide.</p>\n<p>In response to the events, Martinez spoke in advocacy of a gun control bill currently passing through the California state legislature, Assembly Bill 424 (AB 424).</p>\n<p>AB 424 aims to keep school district superintendents or other equivalent school authorities from providing permission to possess a firearm in a school zone.</p>\n<p>The bill passed through committee for a second time on April 5 and must now go through a third reading before being sent off to the state senate.</p>\n<p>“The current California law states that guns are prohibited K through 12, but there is an exception if schools approve it,” Martinez said. “AB 424 takes away the exception and says there shouldn’t be any guns on school property.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the three biggest problems with having guns in schools are the increase in risks of accidental shootings, complications with law enforcement in emergency situations and elevating conflict.</p>\n<p>“The situation is when you have a good guy with a gun and a bad guy with a gun, the police don’t know which is the shooter and complicate the situation further,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>Martinez said “there isn’t one solution” to gun violence, but he believes AB 424 is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>“If you have a solution to gun violence, will it work 100 percent of the time? No.</p>\n<p>But the same goes for seatbelts. Just because they don’t work all the time doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use them,” Martinez said. “Would it ever work 100 percent of the time? No. But it’s absurd that we’re in this situation, and we need to do better.”</p>\n<p>Martinez stressed the importance of gun violence reform and compared the United States’s policy to that of gun laws in other countries, where there is significantly less gun violence.</p>\n<p>“It needs to stop,” stated Martinez. “An American woman is 16 times more likely to be shot with a gun than in another country. We should not have to live like this. Other countries have guns, and they don’t have this problem.”</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t have to be like this,” Martinez added. “And more guns are not the solution to gun violence.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/father-of-2014-i-v-victim-reacts-to-recent-shooting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/father-of-2014-i-v-victim-reacts-to-recent-shooting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/father-of-2014-i-v-victim-reacts-to-recent-shooting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/father-of-2014-i-v-victim-reacts-to-recent-shooting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/father-of-2014-i-v-victim-reacts-to-recent-shooting/","id":4418,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[4417,4416,4415],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Late Surge Pushes UCSB to Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Four runs in the eighth inning propelled the Gauchos to a 7-3 win over Cal State Bakersfield.

With the bases still loaded, senior left fielder Joey Epperson grounded out to score the runner from third and the next hitter, junior shortstop Peter Maris, doubled down the right field line to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to four runs.</p>\n<p>Sophomore relief pitcher Dillon Tate took over from there for the Gauchos. The right-hander had an easy 1-2-3 inning in the bottom of the eighth and quickly took care of business in the final inning by retiring the side in order. Tate pitched three innings of relief in total and gave up only one hit.</p>\n<p>Bakersfield had originally put the game in a deadlock in the sixth inning as sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza ran out of gas towards the end of his start. A single by the Roadrunners followed by a groundout advanced the runner to second base and into scoring position.</p>\n<p>Needing just one more out to escape the threat, Mazza allowed another single to put the game at 3-3.</p>\n<p>The game-tying run ended a three-inning scoring drought by both sides. Santa Barbara previously led 3-2 by scoring two runs on three hits and an error in the second inning. Epperson had an RBI single and Morrow later scored from third base on a pass ball.</p>\n<p>In the first inning, UCSB took the lead by tacking a run on a two-out RBI by junior designated hitter Greg Mahle. Mahle, who has had an impressive year pitching from the bullpen, was in the lineup in Tuesday’s game and singled through the right side to send Maris home from second base. Maris had previously doubled in his at-bat.</p>\n<p>The lead was short-lived as Bakersfield took the lead with two runs in the bottom half of the inning. With runners on first and second base, Mazza picked off the runner from first but allowed a triple to the next batter to tie the game at one apiece. Mazza gave up another extra-base hit before the inning ended to give CSUB a 2-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>UCSB now turns to this weekend when it will play Cal State Northridge for the final three-game set at home starting Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 7th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55180\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55180\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/","id":4419,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4418,4417,4416],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Striving to End Strong","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-08.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-08.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Travels North to Face San Francisco in Final Non-Conference Series  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB baseball team began the season with one of its best starts in program history.

USF came up on the losing side in each of those respective series and has won only twice in six games this year against the conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need all the help it can get going into this series.</p>\n<p>After failing to defeat Pepperdine in its last game, the last opponent that could have given the Gauchos a serious résumé booster ahead of the NCAA tournament selection, UCSB must win its remaining games to have any possibility of playing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>“There’s still a shot. All is not lost,” Epperson said. “We’re certainly in a really tough place right now as far as getting into the playoff picture. We would need to sweep both these next two weekends on the road.”</p>\n<p>The sense of desperation was felt in the 12-5 loss to the Waves. In that game, Head Coach Andrew Checketts resorted to using seven different pitchers and maintained a quick leash throughout the game.</p>\n<p>As early as the first inning, Checketts began experimenting with his pitching rotation after sophomore Domenic Mazza gave up UCSB’s two-run lead despite him throwing only 14 pitches.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB was hurt by its lack of efficiency on defense. The team committed five errors in crucial parts of the game that led to runs in what was one of its most disappointing defensive performances of the season.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of confidence in the guys and in our entire group,” Epperson said. “Unfortunately, we just didn’t win any aspect of the game: pitching, defense, offense. You’re not going to win any game when you’re not doing anything particularly well.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to turn things around but faces the challenge of doing it on the road. Given the Gauchos’ struggles away from home this year, playing with an 8-10 road record, the team will need to get on the board early and take advantage of scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>However, most of the losses have come against Big West opponents. Before losing to Pepperdine, UCSB had won its previous two non-conference road games.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has had productive performances from some of its players despite not winning as of late. Junior Greg Mahle has been doing double duty on the mound and from behind the plate as designated hitter.</p>\n<p>Known this season for his reliable relief pitching, Mahle has been in the lineup in four of UCSB’s last five games and is batting .414.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the bullpen, the left-hander has an ERA of 2.15 and has pitched the second-most innings on the team with 62.2.</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Peter Maris has had a breakout season for UCSB. In UCSB’s last five games, Maris batted at a .333 clip.</p>\n<p>His 2-5 hitting performance against Pepperdine was one of the bright spots for the Gauchos. The shortstop was added to the Brooks Wallace Award Watch List, one of 35 players included on the list that is given out to the nation’s best shortstop.</p>\n<p>USF will depend on junior outfielder Bradley Zimmer to knock in runs for the Dons.</p>\n<p>Zimmer recently made the 30-man cut for the Golden Spikes Award, the top honor given to the best amateur baseball player in the country.</p>\n<p>This season, Zimmer is hitting with a .366 batting average. He also has seven homeruns, six triples and 21 stolen bases.</p>\n<p>He is ranked within the top 60 in the country in both batting average and stolen bases. The junior leads his team’s offense.</p>\n<p>First pitch on Friday is scheduled for 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday’s games will each begin at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of May 15, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55316\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/striving-to-end-strong/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55316\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/striving-to-end-strong/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/striving-to-end-strong/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/striving-to-end-strong/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-15/striving-to-end-strong/","id":4420,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4419,4418,4417],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
