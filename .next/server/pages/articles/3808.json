According to witness reports, the 19-year-old male said he was going for a quick dip in the Pacific. However, his friends’ reported they were confident he did not know how to swim and forgot his floaties at home.</p>\n<p>After arriving on the 6500 block of Del Playa, officers attempted to prevent the subject from going down to the beach and escort him back to a securely landlocked patrol car. However, the aquatics enthusiast resisted officers’ attempts to shepherd him away from the sea, proclaiming his desire to “look at the offshore oil rigs”.</p>\n<p>Officers reported the subject’s decibel level rarely dropped below shouting volume. Despite the risk of ruptured eardrums, IVFP learned from the would-be-merman he had consumed “about 4 beers” after suffering estrangement from his significant other.</p>\n<p>IVFP eventually managed to get the subject into a patrol car. The wannabe Phelps was booked for public intoxication.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Flames from the Whittier fire edge toward Highway 154. <em>McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The fire, which burned thousands of acres in the Santa Ynez Valley, left ash and burnt vegetation that could wash into the lake. Heavy rainfall could further pollute the lake because the lack of vegetation has created loose sediment, resulting in a mudslide hazard.</p>\n<p>Lake Cachuma provides water for four districts in Santa Barbara County: the City of Santa Barbara, Goleta Water District, Montecito Water District and Carpinteria Valley Water District, according to Fray Crease, Santa Barbara County water agency manager.</p>\n<p>Increased sediment flow into the lake presents a challenge for water filtration and treatment, Crease said.</p>\n<p>She said water purveyors are planning to use alternate water sources if Lake Cachuma’s water becomes too difficult to treat in the winter.</p>\n<p>According to David Matson, assistant general manager and chief of staff at the Goleta Water District, the District has moved toward groundwater usage for the coming winter. The Goleta Water District’s service areas include Isla Vista and UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The conditions surrounding Lake Cachuma create “significant concern” about the water quality because of the potential for sediment runoff into the lake, Matson said.</p>\n<p>He said risk factors that could affect the water quality include the severity of the wildfire burn, steep terrain, erosion and the proximity of the burn area to the watershed.</p>\n<p>Although the rainy season has not yet begun, Lake Cachuma has already faced several environmental challenges in recent years, Matson said.</p>\n<p>The six-year California drought reduced Lake Cachuma’s water levels to 7 percent capacity at its lowest point. The newly exposed land experienced overgrowth of vegetation, he said.</p>\n<p>“Winter rains in 2017 resulted in the submersion of this vegetation, which is now decaying underwater … leading to deteriorating water quality,” Matson said in an email.</p>\n<p>Lake Cachuma’s water supply has since recovered, rising by 24.5 percent in one week earlier this year, the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/cachuma-levels/\">reported</a> in February of this year.</p>\n<p>As of Monday, Nov. 27, Lake Cachuma is at 39 percent of its water storage capacity, <a href=\"http://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedFiles/pwd/Content/Water/Documents/rainfallreport.pdf\">according to data from the Santa Barbara County Flood Control District</a>.</p>\n<p>Past fires in the area, including the Rey fire that occurred in the summer of 2016, have also detrimentally affected Lake Cachuma’s water quality. Matson said even the 2007 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2007-09-28/los-padres-area-soon-to-open-after-zaca-blaze/\">Zaca Fire</a> that burned through the Lake Cachuma area has left residual effects on the quality of its water.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the Nov. 30 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79935\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/july-2017-whittier-fire-may-have-effect-on-lake-cachuma-water-quality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79935\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/july-2017-whittier-fire-may-have-effect-on-lake-cachuma-water-quality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/july-2017-whittier-fire-may-have-effect-on-lake-cachuma-water-quality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/july-2017-whittier-fire-may-have-effect-on-lake-cachuma-water-quality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/july-2017-whittier-fire-may-have-effect-on-lake-cachuma-water-quality/","id":3805,"author":{"id":92,"name":"Melanie Voskanian"},"related":[3804,3803,3802],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"County Supervisors Push Tsunami Preparedness","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2017-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tsunami-inundation-map-for-UCSB-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tsunami-inundation-map-for-UCSB-1.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors unanimously passed an honorary resolution last week declaring the week Tsunami Preparedness Week.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors unanimously passed an honorary resolution last week declaring the week Tsunami Preparedness Week.

The previous tsunami caused minor damage to a Santa Barbara Harbor as a result of strong currents.</p>\n<p>According to an email from Wilson, California is considered “earthquake country” meaning “we could be susceptible to earthquake hazards (shaking, liquefaction, landslides, etc.) no matter where you live in the state.”</p>\n<p>“Since they are related to earthquakes, we really can’t tell when the next one is going to occur … We just have to be prepared the best we can before they do occur,” Wilson said in an email.</p>\n<p>Wilson said the tsunami threat for the county is “not large compared to what we saw in Japan in 2011 or Indonesia in 2004” as the county does not have the type of fault capable of creating an extreme tsunami.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County’s low-lying areas like Carpinteria and Isla Vista would be the most affected in the event of a tsunami. Williams emphasized that citizens should be aware of the possibility of this particular natural disaster.</p>\n<p>“There is a threat. Any place where there’s oceans and earthquakes, there’s also tsunamis. Obviously, the world became more aware of it because of the tragedy in Japan a couple years ago,” he said. “Remember that tsunami also hit northern California, causing a lot of damage to low-lying areas.”</p>\n<p>Maps from the California Geological Survey show that flooding at UC Santa Barbara would be minimal and would mostly affect the lagoon.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the maps for the UCSB and I.V. areas, the flooding is not extensive in these areas because they are elevated on bluffs,” Wilson said in an email.</p>\n<p>“Flooding during extreme tsunami events could occur in Devereux Lagoon, UCSB Lagoon and the areas around the airport to the northeast.  These areas won’t flood during every tsunami … just during the extreme ones which we have yet to experience in modern history,” Wilson said in an email.</p>\n<p>The resolution Williams sponsored lists three levels of notification for residents to be aware of: tsunami watch, tsunami advisory and tsunami warning.</p>\n<p>A watch means the disaster may later impact an area, an advisory means a tsunami’s possibility to create strong currents or dangerous waves is “imminent, expected, or occurring” and a warning means a tsunami with the likelihood of “widespread inundation” is soon to occur or is occurring.</p>\n<p>Wilson suggests that if residents feel a large earthquake, they should “drop, cover and hold on” during the tremor and evacuate to high ground or inland once possible. In the event of a tsunami, residents may have as few as five hours to evacuate the area.</p>\n<p>“For tsunamis from a distant source, Santa Barbara residents will likely get anywhere from 5 to 13 hours of warning through local officials or on TV/radio before a large tsunami arrives,” Wilson said in an email. “But the message is the same: move to high ground or inland out of the zone.”</p>\n<p>The county has partnered with the Aware &amp; Prepare Initiative to set up a website to provide residents with public information in the event of a natural disaster or other emergency called <i>awareandprepare.org</i>.</p>\n<p>County residents can use the website to sign up for emergency alert text messages, emails and landline calls which will notify them when there are tsunamis, fires, floods or extreme weather, or residents can text their zip code to 888777 to be signed up for alerts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button
