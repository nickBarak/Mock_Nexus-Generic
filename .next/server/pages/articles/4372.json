The new store opened next to HiWi Tropical Fusion on 6555 Pardall Road as part of a franchise partnership between the two stores.</p>\n<p>The juice bar will sell blended smoothies, açaí and pitaya bowls and pressed and raw juices.</p>\n<p>The Friday grand opening included live music, prize giveaways and local vendor product samplings.</p>\n<p>Monica Martinez, president of HiWi Inc. and the new Juice It Up! location, said the company wanted to bring the juice bar to I.V. to offer a healthy food option to the UC Santa Barbara campus and community.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! will not serve beer or wine, Martinez said, because “there’s already enough alcohol in I.V.”</p>\n<p>“We know that it’s really good for profit, but we’re not here just for profit. We’re really here to try to be a sustainable business,” she said.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! is one of many raw juice bar companies HiWi Fusion considered partnering with before making their final decision. Other candidates for the juice locale included Jamba Juice and Maui Wowi.</p>\n<p>Martinez said she chose to partner with Juice It Up! because of its high quality products.</p>\n<p>“They actually have a full-time food scientist who does hours and hours of testing to make sure that it’s the best and healthiest product out there,” she said.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up!’s notability as a brand was also a factor in the final decision, Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“People would be more familiar with something that they’re used to,” said Martinez. “There are a lot of students at UCSB that are from Southern California, and Juice It Up! is originally from Southern California.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said she hopes the option to order Juice It Up! online will be helpful for students that do not have time to eat breakfast. Customers can place an order online and pick it up on their way to class, Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“Most students do not have time to stop and eat breakfast, so a smoothie or a bowl or a protein shake or raw juice is often a quick breakfast for them,” she said. “They’ll have their drink ready to go and they can have their breakfast on their way to class.”</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! takes online orders through their website <em>hiwifusion.com/menu</em> and offers pick-up and delivery through SBmenus and UberEATS.</p>\n<p>The new store will be open between 7 a.m. and 10:00 p.m Monday through Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

IVRPD will repeat the process to re-pipe the parks for the recycled water.</p>\n<p>IVRPD began gathering funds for the project when Measure O <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-09/measure-o-passes-will-fund-i-v-park-services/\">passed</a> in May 2017. The local ballot measure implemented a new property tax that adds an estimated $256,358 to the district’s annual <a href=\"http://www.ivparks.org/budgets/17-18%20Approved%20Final%20Budget%20Formatted.pdf\">budget</a>.</p>\n<p>Gould said he is “hopeful” the district can begin construction in the latter half of 2018, but said a start date in spring 2019 is “more realistic.”</p>\n<p>Gould also said bringing in recycled water would help increase irrigation in I.V. parks, such as Greek Park and Pardall Gardens, without negatively impacting the region’s drinking water supply.</p>\n<p>David Matson, assistant general manager of the Goleta Water District (GWD), said recycled water benefits both the local community and the environment.</p>\n<p>“Using recycled water for irrigation directly offsets the use of drinking water, thus preserving it for the community,” Matson said in an email.</p>\n<p>In addition, irrigation with locally recycled water saves energy by reducing demand for imported water from other areas, Matson said.</p>\n<p>IVRPD’s recycled water project will add to recycled irrigation that already exists in the area.</p>\n<p>According to Matson, more than 90 percent of UC Santa Barbara’s irrigation involves the use of recycled water.</p>\n<p>The IVRPD Board of Directors approved recycled-water irrigation in its parks during an Oct. 12 board meeting.</p>\n<p>The Board was concerned that the recycled water would be too expensive, but decided to move forward believing the project to be safe enough to proceed with.</p>\n<p>The reclaimed water project would involve the installation of a purple pipe to supply water to the parks’ irrigation systems; a purple pipe is specifically designated for carrying reclaimed water.</p>\n<p>Recycled or reclaimed water is wastewater that has gone through a series of filtrations and treatments until it is clean enough to be reintegrated into the water supply in some form or another.</p>\n<p>According to Hugo Loaiciga, professor of geography and hydrology at UCSB, most of the reclaimed water in California is non-potable, or not safe for drinking.</p>\n<p>Non-potable recycled water is used to irrigate landscapes and plants not intended for eating. IVRPD would integrate non-potable reclaimed water into its irrigation system.</p>\n<p>Loaiciga said the process of reclaiming non-potable water begins with filtering raw sewage to remove large solids. Coagulants are added to condense smaller solids to aid removal of the material.</p>\n<p>Aerobic degradation breaks down organic matter, and a chlorinated substance helps further decontaminate the water. A final round of filtration and reverse osmosis make the water ready for non-potable use.</p>\n<p>“Our actions were guided by a sense of regional responsibility,” Gould said in an email.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 2, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79499\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/i-v-parks-dive-headfirst-into-recycled-water/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79499\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/i-v-parks-dive-headfirst-into-recycled-water/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/i-v-parks-dive-headfirst-into-recycled-water/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/i-v-parks-dive-headfirst-into-recycled-water/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/i-v-parks-dive-headfirst-into-recycled-water/","id":4371,"author":{"id":92,"name":"Melanie Voskanian"},"related":[4370,4369,4368],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
