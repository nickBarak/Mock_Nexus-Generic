Planning a wedding while tackling finals and securing an internship is definitely against the norm, but not unheard of. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first considered the idea of getting married during college, I cringed. I wasn’t vehemently against it, but I couldn’t help but reflect on my past terrible relationships and wonder humorously what the future would hold if I had married one of my exes. Marriage in college would be highly distracting and an obstacle I could not balance with the pressure of school. I similarly thought about my indecisiveness in college so far and some of my friends who have changed their major at least a dozen times. How can someone be that sure about committing to someone in college when so many aspects of a college student’s life are constantly up in the air? I’ve changed so much from one year to another, and I couldn’t imagine how much I would adapt to marriage during these formative years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are not just my reservations. It’s hard to think about the prospect of marriage in college when girls at universities are constantly tweeting about how they </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=text%20back&amp;src=typed_query\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“can’t get a text back.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Are there college students out there who are truly mature enough to be in a seriously committed — not to mention legally binding — relationship and are willing to be tied down for the rest of their lives at age 20? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, there have been various stories about couples who have gotten married in college — some heartwarming and others disheartening. Reading through a </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2v810z/guys_who_got_married_in_college_what_happened_how/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit thread</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of couples who married in college, I was amazed by how many couples got married in their first or second year of college and who have been together for 10, maybe even 20 years since then, living together happily with kids. Of course, some weren’t as lucky and ended up divorcing because their life paths inevitably moved in very different directions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I myself have a few friends who have gotten married right when they hit college — all married to guys enlisted in the military. It is not unexpected that military marriages occur right before deployment because of </span><a href=\"https://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/local/clarksville/2014/12/11/married-military-look-inside-young-military-marriages/20263373/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-term separation, among other factors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. My best friend from middle school and the better half of high school ended up getting married at the end of high school, which I could have never imagined happening. One moment, I could remember us running around in her neighborhood (quite literally) chasing after a boy we both liked, and the next, she had a serious boyfriend for four years whom she married in a small ceremony. It was a shock to my system, especially since she ultimately ended up giving up a lot of her dreams for him, like dropping out of college and forgoing her veterinary aspirations to live with him in California where he is stationed. But ultimately, I did know one thing: She loved being with him, no matter the cost. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relationships in young adulthood are so dynamic and clouded by uncertainty. One day, you could be celebrating your birthday with your best friend, and the next year, she’s gone from your life without so much as a “happy birthday” text. If you can find a built-in best friend in a marital partner during the craziness that is college, that is definitely something to cherish. Having someone who is a constant in your life, with whom you can share the exciting and devastating moments is comforting, to say the least. It’s nice to have someone who won’t outgrow you.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think part of the problem people have with college students getting married is that we have become a largely judgemental society. We adhere to an unrealistic timeline of when major life events should “ideally” occur that defines what is and is not socially acceptable. Not only is this timeline plastered </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-age-to-get-married-is-26-2017-2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all over the internet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it is also ingrained in familial expectations: Graduate college, get a job, get married somewhere between the ages of 24-28 and have kids before 35. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need to reflect on our predisposed notions of how others should live their lives. Because at the end of the day, who should really care if you’re breaking the norm? If you found the right person that brings you immense happiness — why wait?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, college students are constantly evolving and maturing, often for the first time on their own. I definitely have experienced personal growth from high school to college when it comes to seeing the red flags in my relationships. I’ve witnessed the dissolution of some of my friends’ romantic relationships as a consequence of misunderstanding each other or having stark contrasting visions for their futures. I believe that at the end of the day, if someone is in your life who accepts you fundamentally and wants to grow with you, they’re worth holding onto. Marriage at a young age can ultimately contribute to a unique perspective that can yield purpose and focus that others won’t experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will not deny that my personality trait of being a hopeless romantic has contributed to my altered stance on marriage in college. While I haven’t been involved in the healthiest romantic relationships and have yet to date a guy who has truly cherished and accepted me for the person I am, I’ve seen deep respect in a relationship form almost effortlessly in couples around me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve seen the spark blow out in a relationship of mine and reignite with someone new just as fast as the next week. People enter our lives at very fateful moments, and when we individually decide to get married should ultimately depend on individual circumstances — not outside influences or societal expectations.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshen Mantai encourages you to make individualized decisions independent of socially constructed ideals. </span></i></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94091\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94091\" data-attachment-id=\"94091\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-01/argument-in-the-office-married-during-college/college-marriage-opinion/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"college marriage opinion\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94091\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/college-marriage-opinion.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-94091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Melody Wang / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Say No To the Dress</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>by Sara Rubin</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Picture this. You are standing in an aisle, staring at the love of your life while your friends and family watch you take a vow that will last for eternity. During my childhood, I was ingrained with the idea of a magical fairytale wedding. Disney Princess movies gave me a conventional and outdated model. They filled me with hopes that my prince charming would one day rescue me with a kiss. Later in life, romantic movies taught me that at the end of the day, love always wins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, I am nearing almost 20 years old, and the fantasy wedding I used to dress my Barbie dolls up for is the furthest thing from my mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not that I have stopped believing in love. I still hold on to the notion that one day I will find my knight in shining armor. But while taking marriage vows and having a family are important to me, I could never imagine committing myself to someone for the rest of my life in college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s begin by assuming that one has already met the love of their life this early. The first point I would like to emphasize is how young and inexperienced we all are. Most of us have never owned our own apartment or house, have never had a full time job and don’t know what it is like to be 100% independent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newfound freedom we experience in college is an important stepping stone towards becoming full-fledged adults. However, if one decides to get married at this young age, they are skipping past the growth and change you experience when you are forced to stand on your own two feet. Life is full of uncertainties, and while having someone by your side is a constant that can bring comfort, you are also hindering your capability to rely on yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strength and new skills one acquires when living on their own can help prepare a person for the uncertainties that can be thrown at them in the future. This dependence on another can lead one to forgo taking responsibility for their own actions, as they will always expect someone else to help them with their mistakes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, one never learns how to accept being alone. My grandmother always told me that “we must be the center of our own universe, because the one constant in our lives is ourselves.” As college students, we are experiencing a pivotal and impressionable time in our lives, and if we don’t learn how to not only accept but enjoy being alone, then we will never have the strength to get through life with just ourselves. Self-love and self-confidence are what drive us to reach for our dreams, and to be happy with who we are. That is a rather difficult goal to achieve when someone else provides emotional security for you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would also like to point out how important exposing oneself to different relationships is. While I have dated a few people already, I would not feel ready to commit the rest of my life to another person without going through at least a few more heartbreaks. Relationships teach us important lessons regarding life, and help us find out who we truly are. Marriage is a huge step, and I know I will need more practice being in  relationships before taking it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dating also shows us what qualities we want in a partner, and what qualities we don’t. These lessons are a gift that help reveal more of who we are. Not many other circumstances in life can better demonstrate one’s strength than having to overcome a breakup. To have that history is imperative. When we finally find the person we want to be with, we will have learned from our past and understood what it takes to really make a relationship work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this time in our lives we are undergoing massive changes. Grad schools or job offers can be across the country from one another, and it’s difficult to pick up your whole life and move when another person is involved. If your partner keeps you from pursuing your full potential, you may begin to resent one another. Sacrifice is often needed for a marriage to work; however, to forgo such big opportunities is unfair for everyone involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These changes occur in ourselves as well. I often hear adults say that the person they were in college is nothing like the person they are today. We mature and learn an abundance of lessons during this period and sometimes the individual you marry will not be the same person years later. This “metamorphosis” can change how two people work together, and turn a once-perfect marriage sour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, this argument is not to deter people from marrying altogether. I write this as a cautionary tale for those who desire to get married at this young age.

As a team it also had an impressive eight service aces, three of which came courtesy of Keenan Sanders. It also held Lindenwood to a much worse .68 mark on Friday.</p>\n<p>Freshman Ryan Wilcox again paced the offense for the Gauchos earning a match-high 11 kills. This marks the third time in the last four matches that Wilcox has had double-digit kills.</p>\n<p>In the first set, UCSB took control after the match was tied at 5-5. The Gauchos would go onto five of the next six points to take a 10-6 lead.</p>\n<p>At 14-10, UCSB would finish off the set on an 11-6 run to win 25-16. In the first, it was a very evenly paced match for Santa Barbara. Both Wilcox and junior opposite Fredrick Spencer had four kills with Wilcox also having an ace.</p>\n<p>Spencer had a great night himself earning a double-double with 10 kills and 10 digs. Defensively, freshman Brandon Hicks also played well totaling a team high four blocks to go with nine kills.</p>\n<p>In the second, it was more of Lindenwood’s mistakes that allowed UCSB to coast to another easy win at 25-14. The Lions had nine errors and show -.111 compared to the Gauchos .318 shot percentage.</p>\n<p>The third set saw the roles completely reverse, however, as Lindenwood shot .267 and had a team-high 13 kills on the night. The team jumped out to an 8-4 lead and really never looked back.</p>\n<p>In that set, Junior Connor Hipelius was the leader for of the pack for the Lions tallying four kills.</p>\n<p>The middle blocker led the team with eight kills, six blocks and a .667 hitting percentage while sophomore teammate Michael Jennings also recorded eight kills and added in five digs.</p>\n<p>For the most part, even in the fourth set, Lindenwood played better. After taking a 2-0 deficit to the break, the Lions responded to hold the Gauchos to .111 and .136 attack percentages in the third and fourth sets, respectively.</p>\n<p>However, the fourth set saw Lindenwood have many of the same problems as it did in the second. The Lions had 10 errors in the set and shot -.38 as the Gauchos took the last set pretty easy 25-20.</p>\n<p>Senior outside hitter Corey Chavers, who for the second straight match did not have double-digit kills, finished with nine strikes, five digs and three total blocks. And, for the fourth-straight match, junior setter Casey McGarry had over 30 assists totaling 33, a team high.</p>\n<p>With the win, UCSB got past the opponent it should have beat. Now, it will turn its attention to the toughest team in the country, No. 1 Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>12 straight wins is impressive, especially considering the teams Santa Barbara has beaten along the way, but a 13th straight win would go a long way in helping UCSB show that it is for real.</p>\n<p>The Big West Conference currently houses the four top teams in the country according to ranking. League play is now in full effect so everyone will see who are the pretenders and who are the ones that will compete for a national title.</p>\n<div class=\"rich-v2 modern has-sidebar clearfix\" data-module=\"article-rich\" data-title=\"No. 4 Gauchos Tame Lions to Extend Win Streak to 12\" data-url=\"/sports/m-volley/2018-19/releases/2019030923l61q\">\n<div class=\"article-body clearfix\">\n<div class=\"article-text\">\n<p>UCSB’s next match is at 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 14 at No. 1 Long Beach State.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

come a long way this season and before it has a showdown with the No. 1 team in the nation next week in Long Beach State it must first not lose focus on its opponent this week, unranked Lindenwood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Santa Barbara boasts a 14-3 overall record and, with two wins against UC San Diego, it also has a 2-0 conference record. As it prepares to host Lindenwood, who is 7-11 overall, 3-5  in conference, UCSB also has a 9-1 record at Rob Gym. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their previous outing, the Gauchos were efficient all evening, hitting .400 (37-11-65) as a team while their opponent, UCSD, hit just .162 (23-12-68). Additionally, in that match, freshman outside hitter Ryan Wilcox led the night with 10 kills.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For UCSB, this will be the first time it ever faces off against the Lindenwood program. However, against similar opponents, Lindenwood is 1-8 with its only win coming against Ohio State, a team UCSB lit up and swept. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, no one is really excited to play Santa Barbara right now. On top of being winners of 11 straight, seven of those victories have come against AVCA Top-15 competition. Also, a win on Friday for UCSB would give them its longest win streak since 1980.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, of the 12 Top-15 teams Santa Barbara has faced, it has gone 9-3 in those games. UCSB has the toughest schedule in the nation when looking at its cumulative opposition, currently holding a 252-140 overall record. Down the stretch, the Gauchos also have the toughest schedule in the nation, facing No. 1 LBSU, No. 2 Hawaii and No. 3 UC Irvine ranked teams in its remaining conference play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big part for UCSB success this season has been because of senior outside hitter Corey Chavers. For the season, he leads the team by far with 236 kills (3.75 k/s) and 32 service aces. Additionally, Chavers is also among the team leaders in digs (66) and total blocks (32).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chavers has also accumulated three Big West Player of the Week honors this season and has had three matches with over 20 kills. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another big reason for the Gauchos’ success is the collection of freshmen that continue to thrive as the season continues. The aforementioned Wilcox has been arguably the best of the bunch earning three Big West Freshman Player of the Week honors. There have only been nine handed out this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season, the outside hitter has reach the double-digit kill total six times and in this 11-game stretch, he has averaged just over nine kills a game much better than his 6.4 kills per game during the first six games of the year. He is second on the team in total kills with 132.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for other freshman, Brandon Hicks has also been impressive. He too has earned a Big West Freshman Player of the Week honor and has played well on the defensive end for the Gauchos as the middle blocker leads the team in blocks with 54.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of their competition, the Lions have been having an up and down season. Since starting the year 2-6, Lindenwood has won five of its last 10 to be at a steady record but it still has a lot of work to be done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where the Lions have struggled most this season has been limiting their opponents offensive opportunities. Currently, opponents average a .261 attack percentage and earn 11 kills per set. As a team, UCSB hits .326 for the season and earns nearly 12 kills per set.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lions do have three players with more than 100 kills led by junior opposite hitter Charley Hlavin who has 167. His running mate, Nick Stevenson, is tied for second on the team in kills with 129. Unfortunately, the two combined only shoot a .171 attack percentage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, this weekend is key for the Gauchos in the sense they cannot get ahead of themselves. It would be easy to overlook a team like Lindenwood, a team UCSB could beat easy. But it shouldn’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara has a lot of key matches up ahead, especially next week, but the only one that matters right now is unranked Lindenwood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes on Lindenwood at 7 p.m. on Friday, March 8 at Rob Gym.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

To their credit, Long Beach hung around, matching the Gauchos point for point until the score was tied at 29. Then, UCSB’s freshman phenoms took over. First, middle blocker Brandon Hicks slammed down a spike to give Santa Barbara the lead; on the subsequent point, Fredrick spiked an over-hit pass straight down to give the Gauchos the lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But LBSU proved their resilience on Friday, battling back to take the second set 31-29. In large part, junior outside hitter and Team USA player TJ DeFalco dominated the set, spiking six of his 20 total kills. UCSB also made some crucial errors towards the end of the set, with Hicks missing a gamepoint serve and Fredrick committing an attack error that ultimately gave the set to LBSU.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that point, UCSB’s fatigue seemed to set in, with the Gauchos getting hammered in the third set 25-14. After a plethora of mental errors, Santa Barbara fell behind early 11-4 and could never recover. Based in large part on subpar passing, the Gauchos could only get six kills during the entire set; excluding fifth sets, that mark would set a season low for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the intermission between the third and fourth set, the 1400 people in admission did all they could to motivate Santa Barbara, and the Gauchos responded in the fourth set. After a missed served by LBSU, UCSB was up 24-21 in the fourth set, needing just one point to take the top team in the nation to a fifth set for the second straight day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a kill by DeFalco, Long Beach setter Josh Tuaniga proved why he is one of the best players in the nation. Along with his 52 assists on the night, Tuaniga provided four straight aggressive serves that put the Gauchos under pressure. Behind his serving, LBSU went on a 4-0 run, coming all the way back to take the set 26-24 and subsequently winning the match.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All night, Santa Barbara’s unforced errors proved to be their Achilles’ heel; in that fourth set, the Gauchos missed six serves. Against a lesser opponent, UCSB could have used their raw talent to win anyways, but against the defending champions those errors ultimately proved costly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, UCSB has plenty to hang their hat on. The Gauchos were able to give inarguably the best team in the nation a run for their money twice in two days, proving that UCSB can keep up with anyone in the nation. More importantly, a youthful Santa Barbara team was able to get crucial experience against an elite opponent </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something that should help the Gauchos tremendously moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will have next week off, before taking on Cal State Northridge at home on March 29.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
