With approximately 8,377 bedrooms and 215,862 square feet of commercial space in Isla Vista, IVRPD officials estimate the special tax could add $256,348.43 in annual tax revenue.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, IVRPD will levy the tax for the next 10 years after June 2017. Registered voters will receive mail-in ballots 29 days before May 9, and the measure must attain a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>Property owners currently pay an annual rate of approximately $93 in special taxes. IVRPD runs on a $1.5 million budget.</p>\n<p>Rodney Gould, IVRPD general manager, said the additional special taxes could help pay for more park services, especially since the measure directs at least 50 percent of the tax revenue for capital improvements. He said IVRPD will then be able to address the “backlog of deferred maintenance” in I.V.’s parks.</p>\n<p>IVRPD Board Chair Pegeen Soutar said she hopes the increase in funds could bring reclaimed water into I.V. through a contract with the Goleta West Sanitary District.</p>\n<p>Soutar first proposed the special tax measure in February 2016 in light of two key factors.</p>\n<p>The Goleta Water District proposed in April 2015 to proportionally raise water rates by drought level. According to Soutar, this means a $30,000 water bill would increase to $60,000.</p>\n<p>IVRPD officials also foresaw a decrease in tax revenue after the university purchased Tropicana Gardens in July 2015, an Isla Vista residence hall previously owned by a Chicago investor. UCSB is exempt from paying taxes for the property that it owns in I.V. due to state law.</p>\n<p>Despite the decrease in tax revenue, however, the university reached an agreement in which it pays IVRPD the amount lost in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, Isla Vista property owners will be paying the same amount on property taxes as in the 2015-16 fiscal year.</p>\n<p>As of now, property owners pay less on property taxes for the 2016-17 fiscal year because of a land ownership bond that ended in June 2016, paid back like a loan. IVRPD initially levied a property tax to purchase land in I.V., but it effectively paid off the bond in June 2016, and the tax is no longer implemented.</p>\n<p>According to Soutar, the special tax is the same amount that property owners were paying to fund the bond. Thus, if the tax measure passes, property owners will see no change in their taxes from the previous fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“They carefully crafted this,” said Joan Hartmann, the chair of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors who consented to the special election. She suggested that because the tax rates are so similar, “this new tax is just a continuation of what people were already paying.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said she originally wanted to put the special tax on the June 2016 ballot, but was unable to get it organized in time. She and other board members then intended to add the measure to the November ballot.</p>\n<p>This plan soon came to a halt last summer, however, after organizers from Yes on E&amp;F — the campaign which sought to establish a Community Services District (CSD) and a utility users tax in Isla Vista — asked the IVRPD board not to add the property tax to the November ballot.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, one of the Yes on E&amp;F organizers, said they didn’t want to have two tax measures on the same ballot. This would have increased the likelihood of both measures failing, he said.</p>\n<p>Paola Dela Cruz, IVRPD board vice chair, said, however, that organizers were being detrimental to the community engagement process in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I thought that our conversations were already hurting relationships and were hurting our future engagement,” Dela Cruz said. “I was seeing, I think, some level of disrespect. I was seeing lack of collaboration.”</p>\n<p>Soutar said Measure F (the utility users tax measure) and the IVRPD special tax could have both passed, but the board ultimately opted to postpone for a later date.</p>\n<p>“IVRPD needs to be able to work with everybody,” she said. “I didn’t want the Park District to be the blame if [Measure] F failed.”</p>\n<p>The IVRPD special tax did not appear on the November ballot. Measure F <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\" target=\"_blank\">did not pass</a> on Election Day.</p>\n<p>Soutar told the Nexus on Tuesday that she foresees no opposition to the special tax, since the tax is no “additional burden” on property owners and since people are “partial to their parks.”</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can tailor this election to what’s strictly positive,” Soutar said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

community of Isla Vista is certainly one of the biggest perks of attending UC Santa Barbara. Despite the iconic party scene and the picturesque setting, there are risks that are inevitable in a college town. Daily Nexus sat down with three students from the Associated Students Public Safety Commission to give you the tips you need to have a safe time out on the streets of I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Dwayne Mosbey</strong><br>\n<strong> A.S. Senator and Liaison to the Public Safety Commission Ashcon Minoiefar</strong><br>\n<strong> Former A.S. Public Safety Commission Chair Molly Morrison</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What should students be cautious of when going into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> When on the streets or in a party, a simple look around at what is happening can keep you safe, your friends safe and out of trouble with law enforcement. Isla Vista is a friendly and fun place, so it should be enjoyed. But being conscious of what you or your friends are doing will keep you safe, out of jail or getting the infamous MIP (Minor in Possession) … Although it’s an amazing place, Isla Vista unfortunately falls victim to crimes like theft, assault and sexual assault.</p>\n<p><strong>Mosbey:</strong> Even though we are in a relatively safe community, be aware of areas with poor lighting and do not engage those who are behaving in an antagonistic manner towards you. When going out be sure to keep track of your drink and never allow anyone to make or give one to you.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What should students do to prepare for potentially dangerous situations?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The easiest way to get yourself into trouble is by not knowing what you or your friends plan on doing. If you’re going to drink and walk DP, which every freshman will understandably do, have a game plan if things don’t work out. Eat some food before, have an idea of where you want to go, have a backup plan if that doesn’t work out (Freebirds nachos are a solid move), and make sure you know where your friends are when you want to head back home. Pouring too many shots back and aimlessly wandering Isla Vista after not getting into any parties is a surefire way to get yourself into some trouble.<br>\nMosbey: When you go out, be sure to have friends accompany you and keep track of each other throughout the night! Familiarize yourself with the local area and as well be aware of the safest routes to take. Be sure to take care of your personal belongings and keep track of them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What are some resources that students can access when they need help?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The number-one resource students should be aware of is the CSO Escort program. The number is (805) 893-8000 … Call 911 if you or anyone around you is in any danger, perceived or real. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol can respond to a call very, very quickly and should always be reached out to … Good Samaritan Laws in California provide both the caller and the one in medical need amnesty from prosecution for minor crimes like minor in consumption or drug use. Their priority is getting the person in need of medical attention to the hospital, not citing you a MIP. So don’t hesitate to call.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services is the most valuable resource this campus has for students seeking mental help of any kind, ranging from the most benign forms of stress to other more serious disorders. There should be no stigma associated with wanting to seek help — Counseling and Psychological Services just fought a huge battle against UC budgets to stay a strong force on this campus, and students should really be utilizing this wonderful service more.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> Who can students reach out to if they need help?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> Make sure to go to your friends as a support group, no one will be there for you like the friends you meet here at UCSB. Professors can be great help when your course load is getting crazy. Stop by their office hours and you will be amazed how helpful they can be. The SRB [Student Resource Building] has a mind-boggling amount of services. The Womyn’s Center is an amazing resource for many things, including any services pertaining to sexual assault. If you are injured out in Isla Vista or wherever and are having trouble getting to class, check out the Disabled Students Program in the SRB for help.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> When students start to feel that they need help, the most important thing to do is NOT TO STAY QUIET! There are so many people who want to help, and all you have to do is ask. Don’t know where to go? Start with your RA. Don’t have an RA? Walk right into Student Health or Counseling and Psychological Services. No one is judgmental; everyone wants you to do well and BE well.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What do you recommend students bring with them when they go into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Mosbey:</strong> Always be sure to have some form of ID when you go out, preferably a state-issued or government ID, as well as a fully charged phone, emergency contact information and your keys (for those who are prone to losing them, buy a carbineer or lanyard.)</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Buddy system. Too often have students wandered off by themselves, and most end up fine, but some have gotten into situations they did not intend, which can have really serious repercussions … When you go out, always carry a form of ID on you … Also bring an open, but grounded mind and heart. Being under any influence may make you more prone to decisions you wouldn’t make otherwise, so make sure to always have your best interests take priority over everything else.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What are common mistakes made by students, especially freshman or transfers, when they go into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The most common mistake made in Isla Vista is not spacing out your shots or handle pulls. It’s really easy to fill time between conversations with shots. But what we don’t realize until we make this mistake a few times, is that five shots in one hour is a lot. You won’t feel any shots you take for 30 minutes after you take it at the very least, and it’s usually more like an hour. So if you’re not spacing your shots out, you’re gonna have a bad time when it all hits you.

Stakeholders scheduled specific topics to be discussed at the following meeting through mid-February.</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident and business owner Jay Freeman said he did not like the presentation-oriented structure of the parking meeting. According to Freeman, attendees contested the results of a previous parking survey which found a 15 percent increase in parking in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was all a power-point presentation format and we all had only three minutes to say what we didn’t like about the parking study,” Freeman said. “Essentially everyone made the argument, ‘well we don’t have any parking spaces even though you found 15 percent parking.’”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Bonnie Murdoc said she is concerned about UCSB’s involvement in the suggested parking permit program, and is suspicious the University will push students to pay for campus lots.</p>\n<p>“I feel they have another objective,” Murdoc said. “They want people to pay in their lots or want to make parking expensive enough in Isla Vista that people will use their lots. That concerns me.”</p>\n<p>Field Representative from Williams’ office and UCSB alumnus Cameron Schunk said the SB County Sheriff’s Department will not be responsible for enforcing parking permits in I.V.</p>\n<p>“In our most recent conversation, the Sheriff was not willing to be responsible for the enforcement of a parking permit program in Isla Vista,” Schunk said. “Basically saying we don’t have enough manpower to do it without paying them.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65048\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65048\" data-attachment-id=\"65048\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-07/stakeholders-revisit-i-v-self-governance/stakeholders_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444157215\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"140\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65048\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-65048\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Community Organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said issues concerning parking services are complicated.</p>\n<p>“There’s so many different directions we could go with this,” Elliott said. “There’s so many parts of it.

The Gauchos head into the series after a successful weekend as they are winners of four straight. Texas welcomes Santa Barbara having just snapped a four game losing streak with a decisive 6-1 victory against Texas Pan-American.</p>\n<p>“The key [to the weekend] is just to get our young guys to go play the game of baseball and not play Texas,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We need to have the attitude of Texas is playing us and we are playing the game of baseball and that is really the message to our guys. The pitching mound is still going to be 60 feet, six inches and first base is still 90 feet away.”</p>\n<p>Texas at 7-5 so far this season got off to a great start. The Longhorns began the year at 6-1 and swept Nebraska at home before hitting the losing streak against the likes of Sam Houston State and Stanford.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Longhorns are led by preseason All-American junior pitcher Corey Knebel. Knebel was named to the second team as well as the Stopper of the Year watch list and Golden Spikes watch list. So far this year, the closer has recorded three saves in 11.1 innings pitched and is just 11 saves away from passing Houston Street as the schools all-time saves leader. Knebel headlines a bullpen that has kept the Longhorns a perfect 7-0 when leading through six innings.</p>\n<p>The 8-4 Gauchos, currently in fourth place in the Big West, look to take advantage of the strong Texas pitching by continuing their hot hitting. Over the four game winning streak, the Gauchos have outscored their opponents 24-7, and in the last four games have twice won in their last at bat. The success of the offense stems from the ability to get the lead-off runner on board.</p>\n<p>“We like to get guys moving and run. We sacrifice bunted a lot last year and haven’t as much this year,” Checketts said. “Our first order of priority is to steal and if you can’t run on the pitcher or catcher the second option is to hit and run. If the guys got really good stuff we will go to sac bunting because we like to keep guys moving and put pressure on people.”</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB is hitting a solid .280 on the year. Sophomore utility man Woody Woodward leads the team with a .438 average and a stellar .561 on base percentage. Woodward and sophomore centerfielder and leadoff hitter Cameron Newell lead the team with 10 and 11 runs scored, respectively, and are driven in regularly by the heart of the order thanks to consistent hitting from junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>“I imagine if we think the pitcher is going to be on his game and that it will be tough to put up a couple runs we will be bunting and stealing more than usual,” Trinkwon said. “But if he is off his game you may see us swing away.”</p>\n<p>The weekend matchups and projected starters are sophomore Austin Pettibone at 5p.m. on Friday, freshman Justin Jacome at noon Saturday and sophomore Andrew Vasquez at 10 a.m. on Sunday at the University of Texas’ Disch-Falk Field.</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/","id":4660,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4659,4658,4657],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
