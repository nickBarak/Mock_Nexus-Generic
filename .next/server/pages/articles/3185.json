Last season, five rookie quarterbacks started in the first week of the season. This year, however, there is a lack of elite quarterback prospects, with the majority of the top players in this year’s draft sitting on the defensive side of the ball. Linemen on both sides of the ball will be the story of the 2013 NFL draft. Here is a look at the biggest needs for each of the first 10 teams selecting along with a projected selection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kansas City Chiefs: Luke Joeckel, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although Kansas City has needs along the defensive line as well, I don’t see the Chiefs passing up a franchise left tackle in Joeckel who currently ranks as the top overall player on most experts’ draft boards. With this pick, Kansas City can solidify the important left tackle position to protect their recent investment in former 49ers quarterback Alex Smith. Joeckel gives the Chiefs a dominant and well-balanced blocker who can give the quarterback time and open up lanes for running back Jamaal Charles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jacksonville Jaguars: Dion Jordan, DE/OLB, Oregon</p>\n<p>Jacksonville could go a number of ways here but, as has been the sentiment for what seems like the past decade, the Jaguars need help in the pass rush. Jordan is one of the best athletes in this year’s draft and is a proven commodity with his level of production for a successful Oregon program. He can definitely help to improve Jacksonville’s pass rush and switch between defensive end and outside linebacker.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oakland Raiders: Sharrif Floyd, DT, Florida</p>\n<p>After a few mediocre seasons in which they showed signs of life, Oakland returned to the bottom tier of the NFL once again after a disappointing season. The Raiders have a number of needs and could look at Geno Smith here, but that pick would be a reach so I have them taking Floyd, a dominant run stopping defensive tackle who can help the Raiders bulk up along the defensive line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Philadelphia Eagles: Eric Fisher, OT, Central Michigan</p>\n<p>So much for new head coach Chip Kelly making a giant splash with his first pick in the draft. Pressure is on the Eagles to find a new franchise quarterback in Geno Smith, but Smith would once again be a reach here. Fisher would provide the Eagles with a solid tackle that can play on either the right or the left side and help protect whoever Philadelphia decides to run out at quarterback. Maybe Philly makes a move later in the draft to get Geno.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Detroit Lions: Dee Milliner, CB, Alabama</p>\n<p>Cornerback isn’t the most pressing need for the Lions, but it certainly couldn’t hurt to have a defensive stopper like Milliner, especially in a division where the Lions must face the Packers and Aaron Rodgers twice a season. If Fisher is available here, I think the Lions’ priority is finding pass protectors to keep Matthew Stafford upright and healthy, but, in this case, Milliner is the choice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cleveland Browns: Ezekiel Ansah, DE, BYU</p>\n<p>Ansah is a raw prospect with as much potential as anyone in this year’s draft, but he is somewhat unproven. Cleveland needs help with the pass rush and Ansah seems like the player with the highest potential reward. He is a freak of an athlete that can really help provide the Browns with a defensive presence to create havoc for opposing quarterbacks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Arizona Cardinals: Lane Johnson, OT, Oklahoma</p>\n<p>This draft is full of impressive linemen on both sides of the ball and it shows with the third offensive linemen taken already. Arizona doesn’t need a quarterback now that they have Carson Palmer, so the Cardinals should focus on improving the offensive line. Johnson is the best available prospect in terms of value and need. He may not be as talented as Joeckel or Fisher, but Johnson presents a solid prospect that can help to solidify a weak Arizona line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Buffalo Bills: Chance Warmack, OG, Alabama</p>\n<p>Warmack is one of the most impressive offensive guard prospects in the last several years and will help Buffalo to establish a pretty good offensive line. The Bills could reach for a quarterback here so Ryan Nassib makes sense for Buffalo, but not this early in the draft. Look for Buffalo to address the quarterback situation in the second round or trade up into the later parts of the second round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New York Jets: Barkevious Mingo, DE/OLB, LSU</p>\n<p>The Jets sucked last year and that mainly falls on the lack of quality quarterback play. Unless the Jets find a match with either one of their two first round picks, they may stick with Mark Sanchez for another season and help to reload what used to be a scary defense. Mingo adds versatility to a Jets defense that is in need of an intimidating pass-rusher, especially when facing Tom Brady twice a season. Without Darrelle Revis, the Jets need to refocus on bringing back that defensive mindset that helped them advance to the AFC Championship two years in a row.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tennessee Titans: Jonathan Cooper, OG, North Carolina</p>\n<p>Cooper is a more athletic guard than Warmack and can provide the Titans with a solid player to help create room for Chris Johnson. Cooper’s athleticism will prove valuable when he is pulling downfield and setting up blocks for Johnson. Tennessee needs pass rushing help and could look at Star Lotulelei, but the defensive tackle is more of a run-stopping specialist.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Overall, I’m projecting five offensive linemen and four defensive linemen to go in the top 10 with the only non-linemen being Dee Milliner. This draft class is obviously rich with linemen on both sides of the ball. I feel that no teams will choose a quarterback in the early parts of the first round and will instead wait to either trade up into the first round or wait until the second round to find their man.</p>\n<p>Quarterback is the most important position in the game, but there is no sense in forcing a pick when there are talented linemen galore available. However the draft shakes out on Thursday, be sure there will be surprises aplenty. This year’s NFL draft is as hard to predict as any in the last decade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2015883844\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50984\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50985\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-23/2013-nfl-draft-full-of-linemen/eagles-art/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?fit=750%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Eagles Art\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?fit=750%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50985\" alt=\"Eagles Art\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eagles-Art.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page six of April 23, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Looking for a way to win in that game, Orlando exposed possibly the Lakers’ biggest weakness on the court and sent Howard to the line.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Ironically, Lakers fans praised Howard’s performance from the line. After all, he shot over 15 percent better than his regular season average of 49.2 percent. But is this really something people should be commending?</p>\n<p>During the 2012-13 regular season, Howard shot 721 free throws and made only 355 of them. The 721 attempts are the most free throws shot by a center in the league by a long shot. DeMarcus Cousins from the Sacramento Kings shot the second highest amount of free throws of any center in the NBA and he took 423. In the NBA as a whole, Howard ranks second in free throws per game with 9.5.</p>\n<p>With such a poor free throw percentage, teams have become smart, creating the Hack-a-Howard phenomena. It’s not completely new; it wasn’t rare that opponents would hack former Laker Shaquille O’Neal (of course termed Hack-a-Shaq). Unlike with Shaq, who was grabbed once he received the ball, teams are now fouling Howard off the ball.</p>\n<p>Intentional fouling off the ball can only be done until the final two minutes of the game, at which point it is no longer allowed. Up until that point, Howard becomes an extreme liability on the court.</p>\n<p>In the defense of Howard, he isn’t the only one being hacked. DeAndre Jordan of the Los Angeles Clippers is receiving the same treatment, as he is one of the worst foul shooters in the league at a dismal 38.6 percent from the charity stripe. However, Howard draws much more attention, partly because of his star status, partly because he’s a Laker and also because the Clippers have a backup for Jordan, whereas the Lakers have no solid sub for Howard. As a result, Jordan shot just 249 free throws this season, about a third of what Howard shot.</p>\n<p>Many basketball fans (Lakers’ fans specifically) are questioning if a rule should be implemented to stop the hacking, but really, there is no answer. Fouling off the ball is not allowed in final two minutes of the game, putting an end to the Hack-a-Howard, but to make a rule where you can’t foul off the ball during the entire game would be ridiculous and would question the integrity of the game.</p>\n<p>There’s already a six-foul disqualification rule for a reason. Fouling off the ball happens and is valid. Besides, there is no reason to make a rule for basically one player. What L.A. fans need to realize is that the rule is not the problem, Howard is.</p>\n<p>Free throws are about three key concepts: mental toughness, muscle memory and hard work. A player has to put in the time at the gym to get it right.</p>\n<p>This year, Howard made approximately $20 million. There is absolutely no reason that a player making millions of dollars should get away with this. He’s being paid to play a sport that he should love and if being paid that much, to do it well. Let’s be honest, a high school basketball player, on average, shoots a better percentage than Howard. Hire a coach or do whatever you have to do, but there is no excuse to make less than half of your free throws.</p>\n<p>So do I like the Hack-a-Howard strategy? No. After all, basketball is a game for entertainment.</p>\n<p>However, I’m not going to deny it as a valid strategy. Basketball is about exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses and while Dwight brings a lot of positive aspects to the game, he is a downright horrible free throw shooter.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Hack-a-Howard is a valid option for teams. If down, you save time on the clock, earn more possessions and, chances are, you’re going to have the opportunity to gain ground on the Lakers. In his 76 games this season, Howard missed an average of five free throws per game. That can give any team the momentum it needs to turn the ball game around. And if you do have a lead, you’re taking away the option of the Lakers finding a better and more reliable shot, like from Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Basketball is about making other team adjust and the Lakers will have to do that. If a team starts to hack, take Dwight off the floor. That’s what the Clippers do with Jordan. However, Howard’s contract ends after this year and he will become a free agent, so the Lakers have to keep him happy and, as a result, leave him on the floor.</p>\n<p>Really though, allowing Howard to stay on the floor does nothing for his team. His teammates, coaches and the city of Los Angeles clearly have no confidence in him, so it’s not helping to build team chemistry. The missed free throws simply cause frustration. Plus, they’re obviously not helping the Lakers win ball games.</p>\n<p>If you must, keep Howard happy for this season, but if the Lakers (or whatever new team) re-sign him, they should put him on the bench when opponents start to hack. He doesn’t deserve to be on the floor if he can’t make free throws. It’s not any different from the end of a ball game and you’re up one with the ball, so you put your best free throw shooters on the floor. If Howard’s not one of them, sit him on the bench.</p>\n<p>From an early age, players are taught that free throws can win or lose games. Howard needs to figure that out if L.A. wants to win.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of trendingsearches.net</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51025\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51025\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/","id":3182,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3181,3180,3179],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"History Made in the 2013 Masters Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"He can’t win the big one.

This year golf fans were treated to the youngest participant in history and a controversial ruling regarding the No. 1 player in the world. That’s right, 14-year-old Tianlang Guan of China was not only the youngest participant ever, he made the cut and won the Silver Cup. The Silver Cup is the trophy awarded to the tournament’s “low amateur,” or the amateur who posts the best four-day score in the tournament.</p>\n<p>The excitement surrounding Guan didn’t end there. On Friday, Guan became the first player in Master’s history to incur a penalty for slow play. Rules officials said that he was warned about his pace numerous times on the back nine and was finally assessed a penalty on the 17th hole.</p>\n<p>As for the controversy regarding the No. 1 ranked player in the world, Tiger Woods was assessed a two-stoke penalty for an illegal drop. On Friday at the fifteenth hole, Woods was chipping onto the green when his ball hit the flagstick and rolled into the water. Woods then elected to take a drop at the spot of his original chip; unfortunately, he dropped the ball two yards behind the original spot.</p>\n<p>What was controversial about it was that the rules committee assessed the penalty over night instead of on the course. That means that Woods signed an incorrect scorecard on Friday, which should result in an automatic disqualification. However, Rule 33 states that the rules committee can waive a disqualification in certain cases.</p>\n<p>The fact that the committee penalized Woods over night instead of during his round led them to waive his disqualification. Woods said later that he did not know he was breaking the rule by dropping the ball about two-yards behind the spot.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Woods finished at -5 and his major championship victory drought has now extended to 15 tournaments. Did the two stroke penalty cost Tiger a real shot at competing with Scott and Cabrera on the final day?

Campaigned as the “3 to See,” Brittany Griner, Elena Delle Donne and Skylar Diggins will make an immediate impact on the women’s game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Brittany Griner</span></b></p>\n<p>Griner has become a household name in the basketball world with her 6’8’’ frame. With a wingspan longer than that of Andrew Bynum, Griner brings a presence that the WNBA has never seen before. Yes, there have been taller players than Griner to play in the WNBA, but none that can jump or have the talent of Griner.</p>\n<p>Coming from Baylor University, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind, including Griner’s, that she would be going as the No. 1 pick to the Phoenix Mercury. General Manager and Head Coach Corey Gaines knew as well, even if he tried not to admit it.</p>\n<p>The accolades for Griner are numerous. She set an NCAA record for blocked shots, ranks second on the all-time scoring list, tallied a 50-point performance last season and led the Lady Bears to a perfect, unprecedented 40-0 season in 2011-12. Not to mention, she’s already dunked 18 times. And these are real dunks.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Griner will change the game with her dunking and blocking ability. Heading to Phoenix, there was an initial question of whether she would fit in with the Mercury’s run and gun high-paced offense. However, Griner’s rebounding ability will only jumpstart Phoenix’s break and give them a post presence in the half court set they’ve yet to have.</p>\n<p>Plus, for a team that doesn’t focus on defense, Griner’s blocking ability will only help the Mercury execute its game plan: outscore the opponent.</p>\n<p>For the first time in years, all the attention will not be on Griner. The game will be more physical for her, but she won’t have the constant triple team she’s accustomed to. The reason for that is that Phoenix also happens to feature the No. 1 player in the world — and I’m not talking about Griner.</p>\n<p>Diana Taurasi is back this season after missing last season with a hip flexor injury. She’s the best scorer in the world and can knock down the three-point shot from NBA range, which will allow Griner freedom down low.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to bet on who will win the WNBA championship this early, especially with the defending champion Indiana Fever returning its core group, but it is certain that Phoenix should dominate the Western Conference and be contending for a WNBA championship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Elena Delle Donne</span></b></p>\n<p>After this year’s NCAA Tournament, Delle Donne has become America’s sweetheart in a women’s basketball jersey.</p>\n<p>She boasts a phenomenal story, signing with Connecticut after becoming one of the top high school recruits in the country only to leave overnight during the summer without telling anyone due to homesickness. She wasn’t enjoying basketball anymore and stepped away from the game.</p>\n<p>Thankfully for women’s basketball, Delle Donne did return to basketball, but this time for Delaware, the college close to home.</p>\n<p>Dominating for the Fighting Blue Hens, Delle Donne led her team to the school’s first ever Sweet 16 performance, going in as the underdog and defeating great teams like North Carolina.</p>\n<p>Like Griner, Delle Donne is used to seeing double and triple teams on a nightly basis, but what sets Delle Donne apart is her versatility. Delle Donne is 6’5’’ and can easily body up down low, but she also has a spectacular three-point shot and the ball handling skills of a guard.</p>\n<p>She finished fifth on the all-time NCAA scoring list, finishing with over 3,000 points, which is remarkable considering she missed time on the court during her career due to Lyme Disease.</p>\n<p>She’s a player unlike anybody the women’s game has ever seen before, almost resembling a combination of Lauren Jackson and Diana Taurasi — which says a lot considering those are the best two players in the women’s game today.</p>\n<p>Delle Donne will join the Chicago Sky, a team with potential that has also never made the playoffs. Playing with the great inside presence of Sylvia Fowles and young guards like Courtney Vandersloot and Epiphanny Prince, Delle Donne will fill a large role in the forward position and should mesh well with Swin Cash on the wing.</p>\n<p>Despite the recent media attention that comes with her success, Delle Donne still remains an underrated player after playing at a smaller college. But look out Eastern Conference, she’s ready to play.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Skylar Diggins</span></b></p>\n<p>Notre Dame’s all-time leading scorer, Diggins brought the Fighting Irish back into the national spotlight in women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>While she leaves without a national championship, Diggins is the future point guard in the WNBA.</p>\n<p>A solid all-around player, Diggins has great range on her shot, but also can be deceptively quick getting into the lane, showing essences of a Becky Hammon-like guard.</p>\n<p>However, Diggins also gets it done on the defensive end and is known for picking the pocket of her opponents’ point guard, leading to easy layups on the other end.</p>\n<p>As equally important as her play, though, is her leadership. For Notre Dame, Diggins was always the player to get her teammates fired up and has a competitive spirit unmatched by any other rookie this year.</p>\n<p>Selected as the No. 3 draft pick to the Tulsa Shock, Diggins goes to a team that will probably surprise people this season. Tulsa has yet to find success since its days in Detroit and finished last in the Western Conference the last two seasons.</p>\n<p>However, they are a completely different team than last season, and Diggins will fill a role much needed by the Shock. She will facilitate an offense with plenty of talent, playing beside Stanford grads Candice Wiggins, Nicole Powell and Kayla Pedersen. All will be great options for Diggins on the drive and dish, or she can lob the ball down low to the young Australian, Liz Cambage, who, by the way, is also 6’8’’.</p>\n<p>She may be a rookie, but this point guard could lead the Shock to its first successful season. Already beyond her years, this team will belong to Diggins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With all bringing something different to the table, Griner, Delle Donne and Diggins have created a buzz around the WNBA this season.</p>\n<p>The WNBA is continuously improving and showing the capability of women as basketball players. With every year, the league brings in more and more talent, and this rookie class is absolutely no exception.</p>\n<p>For a still very young league, the future looks bright.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear int eh print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50929\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50929\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/","id":3184,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3183,3182,3181],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
