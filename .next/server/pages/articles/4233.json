Now, this experience from her college years is just one of the reasons she changed her mind about the profession and decided to pursue a career in police work.</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing how well you remember that and then you can’t remember what you had for dinner last night,” Avila said, adding that she still remembers the name of the officer whom she accompanied.</p>\n<p>Now, a decade later and recently named the first interpersonal violence investigator for Isla Vista, Avila brims with enthusiasm for her position and the community she works in.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and the UC Police Department <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/csd-finalizes-contract-with-ucpd-for-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">created the position</a> in late November. A contract signed by the two allocates funding to a peace officer designated to investigate crimes such as stalking, domestic abuse and sexual violence both on campus and in I.V. with the latter previously falling to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</p>\n<p>Avila has spent almost four years working at UCPD when she was hired in 2014 after working at Guadalupe Police Department.</p>\n<p>Being the only woman at Guadalupe PD for some time, Avila was often assigned delicate cases, such as child sex crimes, through which she began practicing some of the skills needed for handling interpersonal violence cases.</p>\n<p>Avila’s training also includes courses on numerous subjects, including human trafficking in minors, sexual assault, trauma interviewing and a drug endangered children course.</p>\n<p>Being a mother and a “people person” are qualities that Avila cites as making herself a qualified and strong investigator for Isla Vista, though she acknowledges that sometimes her passion for helping survivors can be overwhelming.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I think I care too much. I get really attached to my survivors. I get really empathetic about their situation,” Avila said. “People might agree or disagree but I think that is a strength of mine.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the duration of her position, Avila hopes to build trust between her and individual survivors as well as the general community of I.V. through community outreach, attending meetings and dispersing information about interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>“I think in general when we humanize the form and the badge and the officer, that barrier diminishes a bit and people are more open to come up to us and inform us of things,” she said.</p>\n<p>The implementation of a police officer dedicated wholley to processing interpersonal violence cases is a victory to several groups and individuals in the community, such as Briana Conway [[ok]], director of Campus Advocacy and Resources Education (C.A.R.E.), and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA).</p>\n<p>Relationships between survivor advocacy groups like C.A.R.E. and STESA with UCPD are crucial for informing survivors of their options with cases and facilitating difficult processes involved in case investigation, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>“When an advocate and law enforcement have a really smooth working relation, the likelihood that a survivor’s going to want to stay in that process is greatly increased,” she said.</p>\n<p>The position of the interpersonal violence investigator fills some of the “holes” that existed in the previous processes for handling interpersonal violence cases, Conway said.</p>\n<p>Efforts to solve cases are now more streamlined, reducing the number of times survivors have to tell their stories. Cases are also less likely to slip through the hands of officers who often have other cases that take higher priority.</p>\n<p>“To be able to have that compassionate connection to at least explain the legal process from their expertise could just be really helpful in the [survivor’s] decision-making process as well,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Conway has worked with Avila since she began at UCPD and describes her as an “incredibly kind and patient” officer.</p>\n<p>“I can say wholeheartedly, from how she treats survivors, [her work is] remarkable and wonderful, and survivors are in a much better place getting to speak to someone like her,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Despite her qualifications and support from community members, Avila acknowledges there are personal challenges that lie ahead in her demanding position. Being what she calls a “feeler,” Avila knows the realities of her job and her attachment to survivors takes a toll on her emotional health at times. She admits she sometimes cries about her cases.</p>\n<p>“You have to remember to exercise, spend time with my family and not get depressed because people are counting on me. My survivors are counting on me,” Avila said.</p>\n<p>After particularly difficult days, during the hour-long drive Avila makes from I.V. during the week, she listens to music, de-stresses from work and enjoys the scenic route back home.</p>\n<p>For Avila, it’s the small things that go a long way and make her passionate about her job. “Thank yous” and smiles are things she receives from survivors that are particularly rewarding.</p>\n<p><i>Jessica Reincke contributed reporting.</i></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Nov. 28, 7:21 p.m.]: Avila’s training included a drug endangered children course, not a “drug and danger children course,” as stated in a previous version of this article. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Rides can cost anywhere from $3 to $6.</p>\n<p>“We thought that same concept could be applied to food security, so we decided to lay out this idea where we create a page for grocery rideshares in the same format,” he said.</p>\n<p>CalFresh coordinator and fourth-year psychology major Stephanie Perez also provided pivotal direction in the implementation of the program.</p>\n<p>“When I applied for CalFresh, I got approved for the program … but there was another barrier that was stopping me from getting groceries: transportation,” she said.</p>\n<p>“This is something that we really need on campus – transportation for students that really need to go to the grocery store.”</p>\n<p>Despite several programs on campus that address food insecurity – such as the Associated Students Food Bank – transportation still remains a barrier for many students, Etaat said.</p>\n<p>“Getting to places like Costco, Albertsons and Trader Joe’s can be difficult if you don’t have a car,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Nadia Abushanab, a CalFresh advocate and third-year environmental studies major, the idea for the grocery rideshare was sparked during the Food Security Retreat at Hastings Nature Reserve that took place in September.</p>\n<p>“In [the retreat] we broke out into groups talking about different problems with food security that we want to address,” Abushanab said.</p>\n<p>Melanie Leung, a second-year environmental studies major, used the grocery rideshare group to carpool with three others to Sprouts and Trader Joe’s soon after the page was created.</p>\n<p>“I’ve only done it once, but so far it’s been a good experience,” Leung said. “I think it’s a great idea because I find it a waste of gas when I go get groceries alone and feel a little less guilty if I’m bringing others that need to go as well.”</p>\n<p>Perez had similar feedback about her experience with the rideshare group.</p>\n<p>“I can pay $5 for roundtrip, rather than paying Lyft $10 for one way and $10 for the other way,” she said. “As of now, the rideshare group has been effective for me and I’m glad we got it started.”</p>\n<p>Perez says there is potential in the future for the rideshare group to transform into a school-affiliated carpool system.</p>\n<p>“We hope there will be enough data from the rideshare group to show that there is a huge number of students who need rides and that transportation is stopping them [from] getting the proper nutrition that they need,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>“Eventually we want it to transform into something bigger where the school provides transportation for students to take them to the grocery stores.”</p>\n<p>Until then, the group hopes to increase its membership to benefit more of the UCSB community. The group currently has over 400 members.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to pick up momentum and hopefully the message will spread and people will want to engage,” Etaat said.</p>\n<p>“This is a mutually beneficial situation. We are very new, but we are hoping to expand a lot.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.
