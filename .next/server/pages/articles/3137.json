For the first time, A.S. Program Board required attendees to present an ACCESS card to gain entrance, making the event exclusive to the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>The change was met with mixed feelings from students but many agreed that wait times were significantly reduced.</p>\n<p>Yasmin Sharawy, a second-year biology major, said she saw a marked difference in lines between this and last year’s events.</p>\n<p>“Last year it took us two hours to get in,” Sharawy said. “This year it took us two minutes.”</p>\n<p>Second-year linguistics major Dana Fallon said while she was disappointed that visitors were not welcome, the change positively influenced crowd management at the historically hectic happening.</p>\n<p>“My friend from out of town came last year,” Fallon said. “It’s too bad she couldn’t come this year, but it was overall a lot faster and it’s more fun with only UCSB students.”</p>\n<p>Local band Sprout, winner of this year’s Battle of the Bands, kicked off the event after gates opened at 1 p.m. Michael Wagman, an undeclared second-year, said the act set a good tone for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>“Sprout was great,” Wagman said. “We got here 15 minutes after it opened and saw the openers. The djembe player was amazing and fine.”</p>\n<p>The next act, Santa Cruz-based ska group The Expendables, received similar praise for their diverse tunes, which incorporated styles spanning from punk rock to reggae. Sharawy said the set proved enjoyable to everyone from diehard fans to first-time listeners.</p>\n<p>“I hadn’t heard of them until now,” Sharawy said. “But they’re really good live.”</p>\n<p>Rapper Talib Kweli took the stage next, performing a diverse selection of tunes with music by other artists such as The Beatles mixed into his own songs. During his set, Kweli reprimanded Fox News for calling rapper Common “vile” and denounced the channel by calling it an entertainment source lacking in real news value.</p>\n<p>English DJ Rusko followed with an hour of dubstep that set off a massive wave of dancing within the crowd but was nonetheless met with mixed reactions. Uce Nnadi, a second-year political science major, said the DJ gave a quality performance.</p>\n<p>“He came and delivered,” Nnadi said. “It was dubstep in its purest.”</p>\n<p>However, third-year mathematics major Eric Frydendal was not as impressed with the artist’s spins.</p>\n<p>“I’m too sober for this shit,” Frydendal said.</p>\n<p>Headliner Cee Lo Green then took the stage, opening with a rendition of Black Sabbath’s “Crazy Train.” The Gnarls Barkley singer covered various other rock songs before unveiling his former band’s top single “Crazy” and his own recent chart-topper “Fuck You.” Green closed the set with a rendition of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing” to end the festival.</p>\n<p>Sharawy said the artist’s performance was an improvement in entertainment from previous years.</p>\n<p>“He started off slow, but it got really good at the end because we knew the songs,” Sharawy said. “It was way better this year. He was a way better headliner than Drake. He tried to please the crowd while Drake didn’t.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38843\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38843\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-16/extravaganza-brings-rusko-cee-lo-sb/","id":3137,"author":{"id":214,"name":"Mackensie Minniear"},"related":[3136,3135,3134],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":214,"name":"Mackensie Minniear","biography":"Not available","articles":[3137],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Council Meets Controversy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council spent the majority of last night’s meeting discussing funding for College Republicans’ proposal to bring controversial speaker David Horowitz to campus.

Finance Board meeting, College Republicans requested that Legislative Council reopen the board’s minutes and allocate $1,770 for the event’s audio-visual, recording and security costs. Horowitz, a noted conservative activist and writer, last visited campus in April 2008 shortly after accusing UCSB’s Muslim Student Association of having political ties with al-Qaeda. Although several members of the Muslim Student Association and general campus community attended the meeting in protest of the group’s request, the council eventually approved $800 to the organization.</p>\n<p>As of press time, the council remained in session pending the approval of the A.S. 2011-2012 budget, which faces significant cuts.</p>\n<p>President of College Republicans Steven Begakis requested $1,770 for security, audiovisual technology and visual recording for the proposed event. Begakis said the council should allocate funds on the basis of freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>“We just want to bring a conservative speaker to represent our minority opinion and promote a diversity of ideas,” Begakis said.</p>\n<p>Sophia Armen, a second-year political science and feminist studies major, said the board’s eventual decision to even partially fund the event reflected poorly on the student government.</p>\n<p>“Our association does not look good right now in the eyes of the average student,” Armen said. “I just want you to understand … what isolating communities really means. You’d better have communities on this campus’ back, because it’s your job. Not just because it’s your job — because it’s your moral responsibility.”</p>\n<p>Andres Rey, a second-year political science major, said denying funding for the event would be a violation of a citizen’s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>“That’s freedom of speech: the ability for you to speak,” Rey said. “I think it’s a very important step that the council approves the security for funding because you are denying the vehicle for someone to speak.”</p>\n<p>While On-Campus Representative Danielle Stevens objected that Horowitz’s views transcended the divide between free speech and hate speech, Rey said the speaker’s words are not inflammatory enough to be censored by the association.</p>\n<p>“The definition of hate speech … it has to be directly linked to a violent act,” Rey said. “You have to prove it incites direct acts of hatred and I think that’s something you can’t prove.”</p>\n<p>However, College Republicans Vice President Matt Borasi said the campus has the duty of providing students a space where all voices can be heard.</p>\n<p>“Do I agree with everything that Daniel Horowitz said? No,” Borasi said. “What I do agree with is the open forum the university stands for.”</p>\n<p>Muslim Student Association member Ahmed Naguib, however, said the Muslim community is underrepresented on campus and is unwilling to tolerate further discrimination.</p>\n<p>“There’s 200 or 300 of us on campus. We really fly under the radar,” Naguib said. “But, believe it or not, this is something that really affects us.”</p>\n<p>Finance Board Chair Katie Lieberknecht said the board declined to allocate any funds to College Republicans on Monday as, according to A.S. Legal Code, the association cannot deny funding to events on the basis of offensive content.</p>\n<p>“You need to base this not on the context of the event but on the event itself,” Lieberknecht said. “You really need to look at the policies and procedures of what can and can’t be funded.”</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President Jake Elwood, California state law requires that the UC Regents not deny funding to events based on their content.</p>\n<p>“If we pass the finance board minutes,” Elwood said, “we will be sued by David Horowitz.”</p>\n<p>On April 14, 2008, the Daily Nexus printed an advertisement paid for by the Horowitz Freedom Center, advocating against the Muslim Students Association and accusing it of being a “Campus Front Group For Jihad.”</p>\n<p>“The MSA is a radical political group that was founded by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the godfather of al Qaeda and Hamas, to bring the jihad into the heart of American higher education,” the ad read.</p>\n<p>Nick Dürnhöfer, editor in chief of the Nexus in 2008, said the editorial section of the newspaper cannot execute agency over the advertising section.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t see that ad before it ran in the Nexus — I don’t see any ad that goes in there,” Dürnhöfer said. “I’m not going to let a newspaper get biased in that way by picking and choosing advertisers … When you start thinking that way, you can’t really do you job as an editor.”</p>\n<p>Following a lengthy debate, the board swiftly approved a motion to allocate $1,100 for the event. However, according to Stryker, confusion arose among the representatives as to what the motion they passed entailed as it followed a string of stipulations and modifications.</p>\n<p>“When the amendment is friendly with the person that made the original motion, then that amendment becomes the new motion,” Stryker said. “So when we passed it, we passed that motion. I guess a few got confused and thought we just passed that motion. People that wanted to vote didn’t understand what was going on and thought it was just to pass that amendment.”</p>\n<p>The result was met with outrage from the audience, as individuals shouted “You are sponsoring Islamophobia and racism on this campus,” and “Who on this board is representing the Muslim community?”</p>\n<p>Considering the murky circumstances under which the resolution had been passed, the council moved to amend the allotted amount to $732, providing funding for only police officers.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joseph Lee said the council was overstepping in bounds by reopening the discussion.</p>\n<p>“What happened to the whole point of transparency of this council?” Lee said. “We’re already not doing our jobs and paying attention to what’s going on and just because we admitted to making a mistake that doesn’t mean we get to reconsider something we all passed through consent.”</p>\n<p>The council eventually modified the amount to $800.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lee presented an apology for his recent incarceration. He spent five days in Santa Barbara County jail in relation to a stolen laptop and, after pleading not guilty at his arraignment on Tuesday, is set to appear in court on May 18.</p>\n<p>“My mistakes have brought disappointment and frustration to both my student constituents and my peers,” Lee said. “I am ashamed and I fully regret this situation.”</p>\n<p>Lee said he felt the incident was isolated within his personal life and would not affect his ability to perform his job.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to do my best to continue to perform to the best of my best in leg council to the students that represented me,” Lee said. “This matter solely matters to me.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37861\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37861\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-05/council-meets-controversy/","id":3134,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3133,3132,3131],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Extravaganza Restricted To Campus, Kept Private Event","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Program Board will keep the Extravaganza music festival local this year by banning all non-UCSB attendees.

While ASPB plans to release this year’s lineup in about two weeks, hip hop artist Cee Lo Green announced earlier this month on his website he would be performing at the festival.</p>\n<p>Special Events Coordinator Ali Abbas, a third-year political science major, said the theme of this year’s concert is “your fees, your festival.”</p>\n<p>“The fact that we are not allowing out-of-towners will mean a better experience for the students,” Abbas said. “They are really our priority.”</p>\n<p>ASPB Commissioner Rae Yamamoto, a fourth-year black studies and art history major, said this year’s changes directly address student complaints.</p>\n<p>“After last year’s Extravaganza, Program Board received many complaints about the lines, the crowd and overall safety of the event,” Yamamoto said in an e-mail. “To remedy the students’ issues, we changed our policies.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College second-year Anne Gumina said the event’s exclusivity spares her from suffering through a potentially disappointing lineup.</p>\n<p>“I chose not to see [Cee Lo Green] at Coachella and I would choose not to see him at Extravaganza,” Gumina said. “Cee Lo Green … more like go ‘Cee’ Al Green, ‘cause he’s better, and you really can’t make sincere love to ‘Fuck You.’”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_36991\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">[media-credit name=”Daily Nexus File Photo” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1512718368\" data-slb-group=\"36989\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-36991\" data-attachment-id=\"36991\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/extravaganza-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=1808%2C971&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1808,971\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"extravaganza\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=888%2C476&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-36991\" title=\"extravaganza\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza-250x134.jpg?resize=250%2C134\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"134\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?resize=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?resize=1024%2C549&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?w=1808&amp;ssl=1 1808w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-36991\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Previous Extravaganza artists include Ludacris, Rebelution, Edward Sharpe &amp; the Magnetic Zeros and Girl Talk.

Yamamoto said ASPB hopes this year’s modifications will make the day more enjoyable for UCSB students.\n<p>“Many students complained about the lines, having to wait hours just to get into the festival,” Yamamoto said. “By limiting the festival to UCSB only, we hope to create a more efficient system of entry.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Yamamoto said last year’s crowds caused several safety hazards for attendees and put dangerous stress on the area’s emergency services.</p>\n<p>“Last year, there were no ambulances available in the county for two hours because they were all at Extravaganza to aid the concert-goers,” Yamamoto said. “Most who were in need of paramedic assistance were out-of-towners.”</p>\n<p>Despite the exclusivity of this year’s festival, Abbas said he encourages the public to attend ASPB’s many other open performances.</p>\n<p>“We’re sorry that community members can’t participate in this event, but we have many other concerts and events that are open to the public,” Abbas said.</p>\n<p>ASPB helped coordinate the upcoming Chilla Vista festival, a showcase of local music and art which will be held in Ansiq’ Oyo’ Park on May 1 at noon.</p>\n<p>Yamamoto said the future of Extravaganza is yet to be determined pending students’ reaction to this year’s festival.</p>\n<p>“I think any changes made will be determined after we see how this year goes,” Yamamoto said.</p>\n<p>Students, faculty and staff members will be required to present an ACCESS card to enter the festival.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/","id":3135,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3134,3133,3132],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Current Council Convenes for Last Spring Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council instated an expansion of the A.S.

Emergency Loan program during last night’s final meeting before government turnovers.</p>\n<p>The council officially placed the newly created UCSB Community Financial Fund — a student loan program approved as a new fee during this year’s Spring Elections — into the association’s by-laws. Additionally, the council approved a request of $459 to fund a week-long advertisement in the Santa Barbara Independent publicizing the May 26 event “The Alternative: Bringing Power to Our Voices,” which will take place during College Republicans’  David Horowitz lecture.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the event aims to appease students concerned about the controversial message behind Horowitz’s speech.</p>\n<p>“He has decades of experience of twisting your words and forcing you to say something,” Tzankov said. “It’s just not a healthy space for dialogue. We didn’t want to work in his space but created an alternative event where we will have a healthy space for dialogue.”</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joe Lee, however, said scheduling the speeches at separate times would allow students to attend both lectures and provide more balanced arguments.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be effective if you see the event first and have a reactive event to that,” Lee said. “We don’t know what’s going to be happening there. Maybe if you have it before or after, students who are attending David Horowitz will have an opportunity to attend this event.”</p>\n<p>Despite Lee’s suggestion the forum was not rescheduled and is slated to take place during Horowitz’s speech.</p>\n<p>The council also discussed a Bill to Restructure Queer Commission that proposed additional unfunded positions on the committee to further gender education efforts on campus.</p>\n<p>University-Owned Housing Representative Alfredo Del Cid said the legislation would provide vital resources to ensure equality on campus.</p>\n<p>“We created the first Queer Alumni Network, which is a branch of the Alumni Association, specifically for queer alumni,” Del Cid said. “We’re just making sure that’s established and institutionalized within the positions so it can sustain itself. This also creates a position for transfer students as a way for someone who’s new to the community to get involved.”</p>\n<p>However, a significant amount of debate arose over the intricacies of the bill’s language including references to the gender identity “genderfuck.”</p>\n<p>As of press time, the council tabled the bill until after discussions on old business, leaving the genderfuck issue unresolved.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38464\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38464\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-12/current-council-convenes-spring-meeting/","id":3136,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3135,3134,3133],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
