Electro-jazz bass talent Stephen Bruner, better known as Thundercat, and his collective label Brainfeeder, has been a powerful influence on the modern hip-hop and R&amp;B scene for quite some time now. Bruner and his mastermind collaborator, Flying Lotus, were major producers for Kendrick Lamar’s earth-shattering masterpiece </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Pimp a Butterfly,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Thundercat himself has added his colorful production to many important artists, such as Mac Miller, Childish Gambino and even the iconic Miss Erykah Badu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, there has been a gradual push in hip-hop and R&amp;B toward a more melodic, jazz-influenced sound and Thundercat has been a steady force. One listen to this vibrant and beautifully disorienting odyssey that is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and this push becomes overwhelmingly apparent. This record, however, is monumental for Bruner, as he is finally stepping out from behind the curtain and taking center stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I stated before, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an odyssey if music has ever heard one. It begins appropriately with opening track “Rabbot Ho,” and then continues to descend into a conceptual drunk madness. The album begins as most wild nights do, upbeat and light, then progresses as the substance seeps in, bringing out darker thoughts and emotions only to end with tracks “3AM,” “Drunk,” “The Turn Down” and “DUI.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flying Lotus is an extremely present voice on this project, as the track list shows him featuring on eight of the23 songs. Although the whole album rings with his abstract and lucid approach, the project does not lack individuality. There is a clear and distinct Thundercat sound throughout. His production is solid and diverse, whether it be his vintage bass walk on cult hit “Them Changes,” the surreal electronic drive of “Friend Zone” or the smooth instrumental groove of “Jethro.” This impressive musical effort keeps listeners engaged throughout and provides a fresh and new sound to the music community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The colorful production that moves this album is also equally matched by a very clean and strong vocal performance from Bruner. His voice is a smooth glowing entity that is wonderfully unique to his work. The melodies he creates are a perfect match for his production: distinct, different and jazzy. The work showcases a few features as well such as Pharrell Williams, jazz icon Kenny Loggins and the legendary rap prodigy Kendrick Lamar. These artists specifically are no strangers to this wave of music that Thundercat has engineered and add their own influence effortlessly on their respective tracks. The one sore thumb on the ballot, however, comes at the hands of weed-glorifying master of mediocrity, Wiz Khalifa. As Khalifa is not exactly what you would call an acclaimed music artist, he seems a bit out of place on the track “Drink Dat.” Despite this apparent setback, it hardly halts the strong track and it is thoroughly surrounded by excellence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another X factor on</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the unique comedic twist that Bruner has incorporated into his lyrics. Whether it’s his painfully honest claim to “beat your meat, go to sleep,” his “Dragon Ball Z” references or his literal meowing over the track “A Fan’s Mail,” the weird quirky sneak peak into Thundercat’s life makes for honest lyricism and a comedic talent similar to that of singer-songwriter Father John Misty. Once again, we can observe great cohesiveness as his odd twist in his words accents his unique production eloquently</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these quirks that make the album true to Bruner, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is at the end of the day a thematic existential crisis that shows an artist struggling, asking questions and answering them simultaneously. Thundercat’s lyrics continually show him contemplating death, the fleeting construct of time, madness, love, police brutality and everything in between. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s title track near the album’s close shows our hero on the negative side of the substance-use spectrum, pleading that “I’m drowning away all of the pain till I’m totally numb, sometimes you want to feel alive, but not on someone else’s time.” Painfully honest statements like these along with little nuggets such as “It’s okay to disconnect sometimes,” makes this album a profound and moving work to go through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an age old saying, especially prominent in the college setting, that goes along the lines of this: “Drunk statements are just sober thoughts.” On Thundercat’s whimsical cacophonic trek through the land of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he has had a little too much liquid courage and finally lets out the thoughts that a sober self pushes to the back confines of the mind. This album is intelligently and elegantly drunk, and at it’s best moments, even wasted, in every sense of the word. It is eccentric, cringeworthy, silly, sad and, most of all, honest. Drunk hits home with its ability to be all of these extreme things and still remain alarmingly relatable to all who listen. Although surely we are not all similar to the mastermind that is Stephen Bruner, we now know that we are struggling with similar staggering, crippling, sloppy drunk issues. It is these issues and Thundercat’s complex dance with them that makes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one of the most compelling musical quests of the year thus far.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

guitar-tosses on stage and a dance frenzy ensued last Thursday as HUNNY shared the Velvet Jones stage with tour mates Kid Cadaver and Armors.</p>\n<p>Kid Cadaver opened up the night with neon electro pop with a slight punk formula that emulated the likes of State Champs and Tokyo Police Club. Their song “Let Your Youth Show” brought forth a dance wave in the audience with the coupling of a wistful chorus and melodic hook. The band’s enthusiastic personalities could be reflected onto their unicorn socks paired with Creepers to their playful banter with the crowd. Kid Cadaver’s electrifying performance was met with applause and off-pitch screams from all the alternative kids that had only came for HUNNY.</p>\n<p>The OC-based band Armors, the second band of the night, left me craving an espresso shot as the band began to lose their momentum in the midst of their set. Their sound replicated a “great value brand” Twenty One Pilots with a messy stylistic blend of electronic, rock and rap. Unfortunately, they just ended up sounding like pop chameleons trying to mask their indie pop sound in several genres. During the lull of their performance, I was attentive toward the sounds escaping the synth and keyboard player, Sam Beresford, who happens to be a UCSB alumnus. I suggest that he should commit a Zayn and leave his underwhelming band for his own good. Since the previous five-piece shrunk down to three, lead vocalist Olen simultaneously sang and drummed while standing up. They have the whole energetic sound intact, but the dark undertones ended up casting a spell on their genuine lightheartedness. Their song “Parasite” was the standout of their lengthy set list, the only part that roused me enough to wake up.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As HUNNY began to take the stage, the glitter-clad six-piece sauntered around each other and exchanged laughter when they hit the wrong chords. I spoke with an impatient Morgan McIntyre, who had recently seen HUNNY alongside the Neighbourhood last year.</p>\n<p>“HUNNY reminds me of all the rock influences I grew up on, and they all look like they just stepped out of Goodwill, which only adds to their whole ’90s bully aesthetic.”</p>\n<p>The ’90s bullies opened the show with “Natalie,” despite the heartrending profundity within this song, the combined background of the Velvet Jones’ faux New York skyline and lead singer Jason Yarger’s drunken slurring of “It’s been a week or 15, Natalie hasn’t said a word to me,” devoured the audience. Yarger crooned over the microphone with wine in one hand, only letting it down to begin his lurid guitar layering. During the middle of the set, after their performance of “Cry for Me,” Yarger threw his guitar on stage and took a one minute break to the bathroom, which left the audience in a state of confusion while the rest of the band continued with an extended instrumental. After HUNNY finished performing every song off their notable EP, they ended the set with new songs. Yarger kept profusely apologizing for the slew of new songs which had fans guessing at lyrics.</p>\n<p>The energy from the audience, hardly larger than 40 people, became immensely more fluid when the band belted out “Parking Lot,” an immaculate performance from Kevin Grimmett who provided stabbing synths. Yarger kept obnoxiously rocking the mic back and forth as I held out my right hand since death by a microphone falling on me is not one of the things on my bucket list. The intimacy of the venue allowed me to be sprayed in the face by Yarger’s spit during the “July” performance, possibly a pivotal point of my life. HUNNY’s fuse of slinky ’80s-style post-punk vocals, layered guitar riffs and genre-defying sound brings them a future of moving on from venues that have a capacity of 100 people to selling out arenas. My suggestion is to go experience an intimate, angst-ridden HUNNY show before they start selling tickets at a $60 price tag.</p>\n<p>Overall, the show was worth losing my hearing for about one hour after HUNNY wrapped up their performance and getting spit in my eye. I was faced with a revitalization for post-punk music, leaving me wanting to star in a ’80s movie with The Cure playing in the background.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68837\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/hunny-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68837\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/hunny-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/hunny-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/hunny-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/hunny-rocks-velvet-jones/","id":6804,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6803,6802,6801],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Coachella 2017: In Review","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No matter how big you look in that photo, at Coachella you’re a drop in a wave. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coachella just keeps getting bigger. This year, not only were the grounds literally pushed outward on the far end, giving the Outdoor Theatre and Gobi and Mojave tents more room (and less bleed of audiences and sound from Sahara and the main stage), but over 20,000 more festival goers were admitted for each weekend. Also, two new, desert-themed tents were added (or a net of one tent, if you subtract James Murphy’s Despacio experience from last year): the punk and DIY-focused Sonora and the breathtaking digital art project, the Antarctic. As the music festival of music festivals grows up and out, with more feet stomping grass and more eyes looking in, it stakes more of a claim in California youth culture. So, Artsweek visited the fest this past weekend to take it all in and break it all down.</p>\n<p>Our generation’s rockstar, Mac DeMarco, won the Outdoor crowd over Friday afternoon with his trademark gap-toothed charm. Vibing effortlessly with his bandmates and friends, Joe, Jon and Andy, Mac’s playfulness was as infectious as ever. Lampooning both the culture of high-profile guest appearances at the fest and the culture of popular mediocrity, the band welcomed “Ed Sheeran” to the stage in the form of redheaded friend and former bassist Pierce McGarry, who displayed an affected British accent. Mac has earned this little jab; even as he continues to accrue more and more followers and influence, he’s continued to develop his talents. As he belted out the first “Oh baby” of one of his best and most rarely performed songs, “My Kind of Woman,” he displayed an almost stunning vocal acuity that stood out from his usual low talk-singing of shows past. His emphatic performance filled out the range of the song, and his increased singing chops paired with the comfortable tightness of his band made this an act not to miss over these weekends. UCSB class of 2016 alumnus Dar Sadeghi counted himself a fan after the set, saying that he thought it was “the best I’ve seen this weekend.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77384\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1133129271\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77382\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77384\" data-attachment-id=\"77384\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/img-665384-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?fit=1803%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1803,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Img-665384\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77384\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Img-665384-1.jpg?w=1803&amp;ssl=1 1803w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77384\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Do LaB</p></div>\n<p>Thank you, bass god. Thundercat started late in the Mojave on Saturday, probably just because he was busy anointing his magic fingers for the show. When he took the stage, TCat was rocking his irreverent style with a gothic, cartoon-villain gargoyle headdress complete with horns, wings, gilded demon-skull shoulder pads and what looked like rondels made of shrunken nun heads. Despite the get-up, the virtuoso’s skills spoke for themselves as he slapped and plucked his six-string’s way through jams like “Heartbreaks + Setbacks” and “Them Changes.” Musician-comedian Reggie Watts joined Thundercat and his pair of bandmates (a pianist/synth player and a drummer) for a few vocal riffs, but his mic was off through the first chunk of his performance. Some more sound issues affected the set, such as the low ends of the bass being too high and drowning some other sounds out, but the remarkable skill and gusto on display compensated. Thundercat wound down with a medley of songs he helped produce for other artists, leading Flying Lotus’s “MmmHmm” into Kendrick Lamar’s “Complexion” and back again.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the most impressive acts to inaugurate the new Sonora tent was a punk act out of Rhode Island called Downtown Boys. Their performance burst with radically political energy, with lead singer Victoria Ruiz calling for the redistribution of power and wealth and the end of white supremacy in between her bouts of wild shaking, bouncing and bilingual chanting of songs like “(Brown and Smart)” and their sax-heavy Springsteen cover “Dancing In The Dark.” As their Saturday set of weekend two coincided with Earth Day and the March for Science across the nation, the band led a small march of their own “toward the phallic-looking sculptures and back.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, the Yuma tent hosted a superset with pro DJs Floating Points, Daphni (aka Caribou) and Four Tet. The three spent time mixing and trading off at the helm, experimenting with each other’s beats and basslines to make new permutations of house for the lab mice in the crowd to boogie down to. All three are modern powerhouses of the genre in their own right, so their collaboration proved a pleasure to shake it to.</p>\n<p>Like the man of the hour, Kendrick, would later on Sunday night, DC rapper GoldLink tore down the lamely common discussion of whether live rappers can put on a good show. GoldLink hosted a party in the Mojave, starting with a few songs of his own in front of flashing traffic light props before MCing a breakdown of age-old hits to bring up the hype level, including hitting a mean air guitar riff to “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” Link wasted no time getting right back to “the regularly scheduled programming,” performing “Late Night” with Masego and “Some Girl” with Steve Lacy, who went on to perform his own song “Ryd.” It was a good weekend for Lacy, the guitarist of The Internet, who would later be given a shoutout by Kendrick himself after his performance of “Pride,” which Lacy co-produced.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77385\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"793888451\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77382\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77385\" data-attachment-id=\"77385\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/4-21-17_coachella-dolab05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?fit=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1363\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77385\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB05.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77385\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Do LaB</p></div>\n<p>Like in Justice’s flawless set the following night, you could feel the Franco-groove DNA Breakbot shares with Daft Punk flowing through their showstopping performance in the Gobi. Though Breakbot is technically the solo project of Thibaut Jean-Marie Michel Berland, the full band that joined the leveled tiers of his picturesque stage set-up filled out the lush, energetic sound of his songs. Vocalists Irfane and Yasmin matched and cranked up the vigorous boogie of their audience, maintaining crystal clear vocals while dancing in step with the guitarist and bassist. Yasmin and Irfane (in his salmon pink suit matching Berland’s all-white one) balanced the stoic expertise of Berland on the keys, and by the time they broke into their hit “Baby I’m Yours,” everyone in the crowd had tossed their inhibitions off like the sweat on their brows.</p>\n<p>One of the most anticipated performers of the weekend, legendary composer Hans Zimmer brought “a cello concerto to the desert,” and then some. With over 30 people on stage, including a full orchestra and choir, Zimmer led the Outdoor audience through intricate arrangements of scores from movies like “The Lion King,” “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Inception.” Though perhaps not everyone in the festival crowd was ready for Cellochella, as depending on where you were standing the people around you might’ve continued their roaring babble over the performance.</p>\n<p>The act that everyone was waiting for all weekend blew Coachella away on Sunday night. Kendrick Lamar, indisputably the greatest rapper of our time, had an easy go cementing his pinnacled place in not only the game but in his genre, his art and his work. Decked out in matching black-and-white Chinese martial arts uniforms to fit the Kung Fu Kenny persona carried through DAMN., he launched mercilessly into cuts from the new album and classics alike. Lamar rapped “DNA.,” “XXX.” and “ELEMENT.” with as much finesse and precision as “Backseat Freestyle,” “untitled 02” and his remix of “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe.” The weekend two crowd was privileged with a little more time to learn all the new lyrics. Kendrick interluded his show with campy, old-school style clips of Kung Fu Kenny on a mystic journey for ass and self-realization. The commitment to the (slightly questionable) character puts Kendrick in the frame of an artist with eras, phases of a long and storied career.</p>\n<p>But Coachella is also about the art (guys, it’s, like, in the name).</p>\n<p>The Antarctic, a “360° audio-visual sensory experience” by San Francisco studio Obscura Digital, was easily one of the most landmark attractions (musical or otherwise) to hit the fest in years. Known for large-scale projection mapping projects on canvases like the Empire State Building and St. Peter’s Basilica, the Obscura team brought the display of their show to the desert. Audiences filled up an air-conditioned dome for a planetarium show tricked out with innovative computer graphics tech and tripped out with breathtakingly morphing psychedelic imagery. It launched viewers up out of the desert Space Mountain-style, into intricately dreamlike landscapes with floating shapes, both organic and geometric, until eventually blurring the lines between the two past the point of differentiation. This breaking down of the barrier between the natural and the mathematical was appropriate in a space so simultaneously rawly human and exhaustively digitized as Coachella.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77386\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1219748817\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77382\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77386\" data-attachment-id=\"77386\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/4-21-17_coachella-dolab01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?fit=2048%2C1408&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1408\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?fit=250%2C172&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?fit=888%2C611&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77386\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01-250x172.jpg?resize=250%2C172\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"172\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?resize=250%2C172&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?resize=768%2C528&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?resize=1024%2C704&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4-21-17_COACHELLA-DOLAB01.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77386\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Do LaB</p></div>\n<p>The Antarctic revived the kineticism of Coachella art, which was missing on the field this and last year, in the digital zone (it acknowledged this self-referentially by folding into its fourth-dimensional collage some iconic figures of years past: the caterpillar, butterfly and spaceman that moved across the grounds like giant floats). This forces the question of how much of the festival, and how much of our lives, exists within the digital space and to what degree we consider that part of an objective sense of reality. There was, appropriately, a lot of heady stuff in all those planes of color and fractals. Said one UCSB third-year, “From now on, whenever I trip I’m gonna call it ‘going to the Antarctic.’” However, he was upset that after hitting the dome three times in one day he “still never got uploaded to the singularity.”</p>\n<p>“Is this what brings things into focus?” is the name for the boxy herd of multi-patterned creatures that populated your Instagram feed this week. They were built by U.K. artists Joanne Tatham and Tom O’Sullivan. In person, these grazing six-story monsters were much more towering than photos could do justice to, playing with the scope and perspective of an actual event and the hyper-documentation of it. Compounded with the outward expansion of the festival’s grounds, these monumental sculptures gave one a tilt-shifted impression of their small space on the fields. No matter how big you look in that photo, at Coachella you’re a drop in a wave.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/coachella-2017-in-review/","id":6805,"author":{"id":703,"name":"Frankie Horne"},"related":[6804,6803,6802],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: Playboi Carti by Playboi Carti","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/playboi-carti-interscope-records.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/playboi-carti-interscope-records.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"If Frank Ocean can indulge in Carti’s sound guilt-free, anyone can be driven to the pleasure-filled land of production excellency, designer brands and jewelry pieces found on Carti’s tape.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In New York, I milly rock, hide it in my sock,” a line off Playboi Carti’s latest single, “Magnolia,” has probably weaseled its way onto your Twitter timeline, accompanied by a group of industrial goths dancing under a bridge. Playboi Carti, a frontrunner for the 2017 XXL Freshman List and A$AP Mob affiliate, released his self-titled mixtape last week, propelling Carti Season into full force. Influenced by the South Atlanta rap scene in which Gucci Mane reigned supreme, Playboi Carti provides his dose of charisma through his heavily anticipated 15-track mixtape.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carti’s musical catalog before his debut project was fairly limited. He only dropped a couple of features and hits, and the idea of a cohesive project reached mythical proportions. Soundcloud has provided a medium for the new wave of VLONE-clad rappers to gain cult fanatical status, as their songs become the emblematic hype anthems for car rides and parties around the world. If you are looking for a rapper to give you a concept album sprinkled with samples and conscious messages about our society, head to Kendrick and Joey Bada$$’s latest albums — as Playboi Carti will not give you the same plethora of confounding statements. When one listens to Carti, they don’t listen to find groundbreaking thematic revelations or witty metaphors hidden within his lyrics. Rather, they listen for the progressive beats and Carti’s earworm tracks that ease their way into the listener’s mentality.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The producer masterminds behind Carti’s project are Pierre Bourne, Harry Fraud, Southside, Ricci Riera and Roark Baily — all are part of the group of unsung heroes behind your favorite Soundcloud rappers. Twenty-three-year-old Bourne is credited for six songs on the tape, implementing his audio engineering magic to illuminate the catchy singles “wokeuplikethis” and “Magnolia.” As for Carti’s narrative contents, you can expect to find hints of exemplary fashion advice like rocking Ksubi jeans, Alexander McQueen and Rick Owens. Carti grants opportunities for his fellow Raf Simons consumers to display their talents, as illustrated by the captivating track “New Choppa,” where A$AP Rocky delivers his smooth cadence when rapping about his fast Adidas. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduation from the “Broke Boi” rapper who was still working retail at H&amp;M while dropping songs on Soundcloud to the Carti that is selective on the ice he buys is evident throughout the tracklisting. The infectious bassline that pounds in the stellar banger, “Magnolia,” takes the listener on an excursion into Carti’s lifestyle. Two lively collaborations containing muffled keyboard melodies with Lil Uzi Vert — “wokeuplikethis” and “Lookin” — have well over 20 million plays on Soundcloud and have designated spots on everyone’s pre-game playlists. The closest Carti gets to lamenting is when he raps about his reliance on Xanax in “Let It Go,” likening the drug to a controlling force of his life. The juxtaposition in Carti’s tape is that it is often categorized in the last tier of what purist rap consumers would ever find compelling, but it is merely impossible not to start shimmying your shoulders like Lil Uzi Vert and replicating Carti’s occasional ad-libs. Attempting to not like Carti is similar to trying not to eat all your McDonald’s fries while you’re driving home. You will eventually cave into temptation and find yourself  humming along to his beats, despite your self-containment to never associate with “hypebeast music.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite trap music being a means of pure entertainment rather than contributing exceptional social commentary, Carti’s music could use some improvement. However, this will all come in time, since, again, he is only 20 years old. In a future follow-up, Carti can provide more of an auditory variance in flow delivery and experiment with versatile lyrics, allowing him to be more engaging rather than remaining repetitive throughout a whole project. Frank Ocean, everyone’s favorite singer, has collaborated with Carti on an unreleased track which may never get to bless the ears of the public. In the words of Carti himself, “We made a song and it was very lit, I don’t know if the world’s going to get it, though.” If Frank Ocean can indulge in Carti’s sound guilt-free, anyone can be driven to the pleasure-filled land of production excellency, designer brands and jewelry pieces found on Carti’s tape. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/the-friday-review-playboi-carti-by-playboi-carti/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/the-friday-review-playboi-carti-by-playboi-carti/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/the-friday-review-playboi-carti-by-playboi-carti/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/the-friday-review-playboi-carti-by-playboi-carti/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-28/the-friday-review-playboi-carti-by-playboi-carti/","id":6806,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6805,6804,6803],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
