[Tuesday’s] report by the NCAA Committee on Infractions is the result of an investigation that was conducted cooperatively by the NCAA enforcement staff and the university,” Bill Mahoney, associate athletics director of communications, said in a statement on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Santa Barbara is disappointed that the violations happened. The University is committed to learning from the process and continuing to promote student-athlete welfare and competition with integrity as core values of the university’s athletics department.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the track program, a former head coach, who was with the program for over 30 years and is not named in the decision, was found to have violated restrictions on “countable athletically related activities,” otherwise known as CARA. The only head coach who was with UCSB during this time was the former Head Coach Pete Dolan, according to UCSB’s website. Dolan was fired from the position in June 2018 and later filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the decision, the head coach expected student athletes to “log their training activity” during “summer months outside of the playing season and the required weekly day off during the season</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">w</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hich is prohibited under NCAA rules, according to the decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He actively monitored these logs, provided feedback on the student-athletes’ training, and in some instances admonished or otherwise disciplined student-athletes who did not complete their logs,” the decision states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the head coach was actively involved in the logs, and the training activity was “not initiated or requested solely by the student-athletes,” the NCAA considered his activities “impermissible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the men’s water polo team, the head water polo coach “impermissibly facilitated housing for one of the student-athletes who wanted to come to Santa Barbara prior to his enrollment and compete on a local water polo club team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head water polo coach during that time was Wolf Wigo, who is currently employed by the university, according to UCSB’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NCAA committee found that this led to other restricted recruiting inducements, including free meals and transportation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the head water polo coach and the assistant water polo coach were found to have improperly compensated two international student-athletes, who are not named in the decision, with “a monthly stipend that equaled the exact amount of their rent and transferred the payment directly to the student-athletes’ landlord.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two student-athletes were employed at a water polo club co-owned by the head water polo coach and the assistant water polo coach, and were paid “significantly higher” rates compared to the hourly rates of other student-athletes working in similar positions at the club, according to the decision. The two student-athletes were also found to have been occasionally paid for “work not actually performed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Tuesday’s decision, the head track coach involved is now subject to a one-year show-cause order, which follows him to any NCAA institution that he may be employed by or affiliated with between Nov. 5, 2019 and Nov. 4, 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Should the head track coach become employed in an athletically related position at an NCAA member institution during the one-year show-cause period, the head track coach shall be suspended from 30 percent of the season’s contests,” the decision writes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the NCAA decision, the head and assistant water polo coaches are subject to two-year and one-year show-cause orders respectively, which prohibit them from a number of coaching duties during their show-cause order time periods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head water polo coach, who was found to be “personally involved in arranging a recruiting inducement and providing extra benefits in the form of improper compensation and pay for work not performed,” is prohibited from all off-campus recruiting activities during this two-year period, which is applied to any NCAA-affiliated institution that they may be employed by during the period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The head coach is also suspended from the first 30% of the season’s contests during the first year of the show-cause period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The provisions of this suspension require that the head water polo coach not be present in the facility where contests are held and have no contact or communication with men’s water polo coaching staff members or student-athletes during the suspension dates,” the decision read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The prohibition includes all coaching activities for the period of time that begins at 12:01 a.m. on the day of the contest and ends at 11:59 p.m. that day. During that period, the head coach may not participate in any coaching activities, including, but not limited to, team travel, practice, video study, recruiting and team meetings.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the results of any contests during this suspension will not count for the head coach’s coaching record.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the assistant water polo coach’s show-cause period, they are to be suspended from 30% of the season’s contests, a suspension that will be served after the head water polo coach’s  suspension from the first 30% of the contests is served. The provisions of the assistant coach’s show-cause period are the same as the head coach’s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the penalties on the coaches, UCSB is placed on probation for two years, beginning Nov. 5, 2019, and ending Nov. 4, 2021, and is required to pay a fine of $5,000 “plus one percent of each of the budgets for the men’s water polo, men’s cross country and women’s cross country programs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track and men’s water polo programs are also required to put limitations on their recruiting visits and reduce the scholarships they give out, based on previous self-imposed restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A number of the penalties listed in the decision are self-imposed, including the men’s water polo team abstaining from participating in post-season conference and NCAA tournament competition during the 2018 season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since two student-athletes involved in the water polo program violations are now considered ineligible, UCSB is required to vacate all “regular season and conference tournament records and participation in which the two ineligible student-athletes competed from the time they became ineligible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Further, UCSB’s records regarding its men’s water polo program, as well as the records of the head men’s water polo coach, shall reflect the vacated records,” the decision read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the other self-imposed restrictions, which occurred while the NCAA investigation was occuring, included the men’s water polo coaching staff being barred from recruiting communication with prospective international student-athletes from April 1, 2018, through Dec. 31, 2018, other than the student-athletes who had already verbally committed to or been signed by UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, with the track program, “UCSB reduced CARA by four hours per week for cross country student-athletes and track and field student-athletes who are also on the cross country squad list.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also required track program athletes to take two days off per week from CARA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During UCSB’s probation period, the university is required to “develop and implement a comprehensive educational program on NCAA legislation to instruct coaches, the faculty athletics representative, all athletics department personnel and all institutional staff members with responsibility for recruiting and certification legislation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, they must submit a report to the NCAA committee by Jan. 15, 2020, informing them of their implementation plan and schedule. They must also file annual compliance reports by Aug. 30 of each year of probation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Particular emphasis shall be placed on rules education and monitoring related to CARA and student-athlete employment,” according to the decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All student-athletes prospects must also be informed of UCSB’s probation status, and UCSB must “publicize specific and understandable information” about the infractions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once UCSB submits its final compliance report, and before the probation period is concluded, Chancellor Yang must also send a letter to the NCAA “affirming that UCSB’s current athletics policies and practices conform to all requirements of NCAA regulations.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Omar Hernandez contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Senate Facebook page on Nov. 1. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been three allegations of sexual assault brought against Sigma Pi; the first two were reported by the Nexus on </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oct. 24</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while the third was reported by the university through a timely warning sent out on Oct. 28. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura was the one who first brought up the recent allegations to the Senate during the Wednesday night meeting, emphasizing the importance of making survivors of sexual assault aware of the resources available to them through A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate then went into a working group to write a draft of the statement, which was later posted on Facebook alongside a note encouraging attendance of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a town hall hosted by Students Against Sexual Assault on Nov. 14.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement condemns “unsafe spaces” and “any student organization that perpetuates the harassment and abuse of any person”; it also calls for the UCSB administration to respond to “environments that enable sexual violence.” The statement did not name any particular organization or environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its statement, the Senate added that it believes these allegations are not isolated incidents and are instead “a reflection of a greater culture that allows sexual violence to continue.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This harmful culture needs to be addressed and stopped,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Vice President Alli Adam echoed similar points in a statement to the Nexus, stating A.S. “[doesn’t] condone what’s going on in our own community and [has] no problem standing up to fellow community members and confronting this unfortunate culture.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also mentioned that the Senate emphasized the need to demonstrate support rather than simply listing resources for survivors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Something that [the senators] brought up that I thought was really powerful is they didn’t want to just list resources because students kind of feel like that’s redirecting the issue, but [the senators] all were willing to make themselves available as well. So I thought that was a really unique perspective to take, and I’m proud of that,” Adam said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement released by the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) parallels the Senate’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one should have to spend their nights out in fear. It’s on us to take a deep look at the culture that enabled this incident, and correct it,” Board President Spencer Brandt said in the statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kristie Nguyen, board director for the I.V. CSD, the problem doesn’t lie within Greek life as </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some social media posts have </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said, but with the individual.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to see [people] blaming the Greek community for recreating this culture because this culture has already been prevalent throughout society. It’s a huge epidemic,” Nguyen said in a phone call with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you look into it, a lot of people in the Greek community – like fraternities – don’t condone that kind of behavior. It was more of an individual choice to make those disgusting decisions to do that to people. We shouldn’t be blaming anyone but the people who have done what they did.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD’s statement was sent out on Oct. 24 — prior to the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by UCSB to all students on Oct. 28.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said he was “incredibly frustrated and disgusted” by the alleged crime in the timely warning sent out on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that under all the scrutiny that the university is providing [Sigma Pi] right now, there was another incident, really speaks to the institutional problem, a problem with the culture,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement also lists a variety of resources for survivors of sexual assault offered by the I.V. CSD and UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t just stand by without doing something. While we’re already providing services like our interpersonal violence and sexual education and prevention program along with the survivor resource center, we also just want to continue to make it clear what our values are and how we will support survivors,” I.V. CSD Director Ethan Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will believe survivors and we will stand with that.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The Los Angeles Lakers also kept their pick, avoiding the potential disaster of two teams jumping them in the lottery, a scenario with a probability just under 45 percent, in which case they would’ve had to sacrifice their No. 4 pick to Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>Despite the lack of excitement on lottery night, knowing the fixed order allows us to start putting together a more accurate mock draft. I’ll give a choice of 1A or 1B — a worst-case pick scenario and a possible trade for each team in the top three — along with a normal mock for the rest of the lottery.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1A: Ben Simmons</strong></p>\n<p>The Sixers have to be keyed in on Ben Simmons in the pre-draft process. While Ingram won’t be a disaster pick, Simmons is the exact type of player they’ve been looking for during this entire process. Whether or not he reaches his ceiling, that ceiling is a perennial all-star, and there’s no reason to pass that up because of a season with mixed results at LSU.</p>\n<p>The Simmons-Embiid pick and roll is the Sixers’ best shot at having a truly un-guardable play in their arsenal, and Jahlil Okafor and Dario Saric are not of the ilk to throw that away. Finding a team to take those two in return for established role players would be an easy feat, with the Celtics being a team that was already rumored to have interest in Okafor during the trade deadline.</p>\n<p>Simmons would force the Sixers to clear out an overcrowded front court, but Bryan Colangelo seems intent on roster change anyway, making Simmons an even clearer choice.</p>\n<p><strong>1B: Brandon Ingram</strong></p>\n<p>If they get cold feet, Ingram won’t be an atrocious pick, as he will allow the team to stay together. If Saric turns out to be an immediate threat on offense and he and Ingram rain threes around further-along-than-we-thought Embiid and Okafor post-ups all season, then this pick doesn’t look half bad.</p>\n<p>Ingram would most likely start at shooting guard alongside Embiid, Saric and Robert Covington in a lineup that has to look promising to Sixers fans with three potential Rookie of the Year candidates.</p>\n<p>Considering that Simmons may force his way to Los Angeles — an unlikely but imaginable scenario — Ingram is a decent plan B for the Sixers.</p>\n<p><strong>Worst Case: Kris Dunn</strong></p>\n<p>While Dunn is a solid player and point guard is a position of need for the Sixers, he is certainly not worth the top pick. They could trade back with a team like the Celtics, Suns or even the Timberwolves depending on what they were looking for in return, but with such a perceived gap between Simmons, Ingram and the rest of the draft, this seems unlikely.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential trades:</strong></p>\n<p>Separated into two groups: trading down in the draft and trading for a star.</p>\n<p><strong>Trading down</strong>: (<strong>Celtics</strong>) Sixers get pick No. 3, pick No. 16, pick No. 23, Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk and Celtics get pick No. 1; (<strong>Suns</strong>) Sixers get pick No. 4, pick No. 13, Devin Booker, PJ Tucker and Suns get pick No. 1; (<strong>Timberwolves</strong>) Sixers get pick No. 5, Ricky Rubio, Zach LaVine.</p>\n<p>Each of these trades gives the Sixers a credible way to build their backcourt while still maintaining a value based approach and getting a good deal of bang for their buck. My favorite deal would probably be some form of the one with the Suns, as Booker and Dunn could combine for a really skilled backcourt and Tucker would provide a veteran who could actually contribute to this Philadelphia team.</p>\n<p><strong>Trading for a star</strong>: Sixers get Paul George and Pacers get pick No. 1, Dario Saric and Nerlens Noel; Sixers get Jimmy Butler and Bulls get pick No. 1, Nerlens Noel and Jerami Grant.</p>\n<p>These are the two names (George and Butler) that have been thrown out a lot since the end of the season, and both fit huge holes in both the Sixers roster and [[the]] rebuilding project. If the Pacers or Bulls were to agree to a version of these offers, probably excluding only Joel Embiid, the Sixers should be quick to accept.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Los Angeles Lakers</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>1A: Ben Simmons</strong></p>\n<p>The Sixers taking Ingram is still the best case scenario for the Lakers, who desperately need another source of efficient offense to pair with D’Angelo Russell. Simmons would be a bit of an awkward fit while Russell has the ball in his hands, but two players with that kind of passing ability on the same team causes the heart to flutter.</p>\n<p>Luke Walton would have his centerpieces of the future, and though it might not be enough to save Jim Buss’ job, drafting Ben Simmons would bring stability back to “Lakernation.”</p>\n<p><strong>1B: Brandon Ingram</strong></p>\n<p>If the Sixers make the correct pick, the Lakers are left with another easy choice as they’ll snatch up Ingram and allow Randle to stay in the starting lineup. While Randle is certainly worthy of a bench role with Simmons on the team, him running pick and roll with Russell, surrounded by capable shooters in Ingram and Clarkson, is the beginning of a productive offense.</p>\n<p>Ingram may well be better than Simmons if he hits all his ceilings, and he is a year younger than the Australian native, but the likelihood that he reaches his peak seems less compared the young man who came close to averaging 20, 10 and five in his freshman season in college, albeit on a sorry LSU team.</p>\n<p>In the long term, an Ingram and Russell duo may even be able to play with one another in the backcourt in a super tall lineup that could baffle defenses with skill and size. Ingram’s ability to play three different positions will drastically help the Lakers embrace contemporary NBA basketball.</p>\n<p><strong>Worst Case: Buddy Hield</strong></p>\n<p>The Lakers maybe become enamored with the college stardom of Buddy Hield, either one of the obvious picks really disappoints pre-draft and the Lakers pass on a star to draft a guy who doesn’t fit with either Clarkson or Russell. However, this scenario is unlikely as scouts have had Ingram and Simmons pegged as the one and two picks for months.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential trades</strong>: D’Angelo Russell and pick No. 2 for either Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Demarcus Cousins or James Harden. While the Pacers, Bulls, Kings and Rockets will probably choose to keep their developed stars, if any team shows interest in a deal, the Lakers should jump at the opportunity and hope they can use it to entice Kevin Durant or another top-line free agent.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Boston Celtics</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>1A: Dragan Bender</strong></p>\n<p>Bender is a solid consolation prize for Boston, fitting the mold of a rangy, shot-blocking four who appears fully equipped to one day have a potent offensive game. While young and undeveloped, according to <em>RealGM</em>.<em>com,</em> Bender shot over 36 percent on 1.92 three pointers per game, solid numbers considering he played only 12 minutes per contest with Maccabi Tel Aviv in the 2015-16 season of international competition.</p>\n<p>His steal and block percentages sit at 2.17 and 6.17, respectively, for the same international competition this year via <em>RealGm.com</em>, numbers that would place him toward the top of the league for a big man in both categories according to <em>Basketballreference</em>.<em>com</em>. Bender is also a good athlete and should be able to play the three through five positions in time, which could be important to the mobile defense the Celtics are trying to construct.</p>\n<p>If Bender shows the ability to combine what could be an unsolvable offensive game with adaptable defense, his ceiling becomes much higher. Brad Stevens is the perfect coach to develop the seven-footer’s unique game, and Bender would finally give Boston a prospect with star-level ceiling.</p>\n<p>Assuming he’s there at three and there’s no trade offer from the teams mentioned in the Lakers section, Danny Ainge would be a fool to pass on such a perfect talent for the innovative team he’s creating.</p>\n<p><strong>1B: Marquese Chriss</strong></p>\n<p>The Celtics don’t have a great second option here, as guards are what this draft has to offer despite the fact that Boston has a roster full of them. Kris Dunn is probably the third or fourth best player in this draft, but Dunn’s talent isn’t daunting enough to blow up one of the cheapest and deepest backcourts in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Jamal Murray can shoot the heck out of the ball, but his other NBA level skills are lacking to say the least, making his ceiling far too low for the No. 3 pick. Though Buddy Hield showed a well-developed game in his senior year, his measurables weren’t impressive enough to allow him to play comfortably at the three in small ball lineups, something else that would clog up the C’s backcourt.</p>\n<p>Thus, if the Celtics are going to pass on Bender, they should do it for the player with nearly the most potential in this draft, Marquese Chriss. No player in this draft — not Ben Simmons, not Brandon Ingram, nobody — will blow your mind on certain plays like Marquese Chriss. His jumping ability, speed and nose for the ball give him the potential to be a real force in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Brad Stevens would be a great coach to bring Chriss along slowly, and his potential shot blocking and controlled aggression fits seamlessly with Smart, Bradley and Crowder in a swarming Boston defensive unit. The Celtics are in no need of quality role players; they have a team filled top to bottom with guys who could easily find a spot on every NBA rotation. The Celtics are in need of true transformational talents, making Chriss an easy pick over the likes of Murray and Hield.</p>\n<p><strong>Worst case: trading the pick for a non-star</strong></p>\n<p>The worst case for the Celtics is Ainge getting antsy and trading away the pick because he doesn’t want to develop a raw player like Bender or Chriss. While Celtics fans certainly want to be in contention soon, there are nearly zero options better than choosing either one of the young swings in Bender or Chriss.</p>\n<p>Jahlil Okafor’s name has been bandied about as a trade target with the No. 3 pick, and though his playmaking and ability to put the ball in the bucket would fit nicely with the Celtics, Bender and Chriss each offer a much more reliable path in the years to come. Stevens loves players who can toggle between the wing and big man positions, and at the three spot in the draft he should have his choice between two superior options.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade options</strong>: <strong>Gordon Hayward or Derrick Favors in a “who says no” offer</strong>.</p>\n<p>Bender and Chriss certainly hold the talent to be better than those two, but the uncertainty they get there is substantial. Hayward and Favors immediately make the Celtics more serious in the East and up Boston’s free-agent profile considerably.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Phoenix Suns: Marquese Chriss</strong></p>\n<p>They will be hoping Dragan Bender falls to them, and it wouldn’t be a surprising outcome to see the Suns attempt to trade up with the Celtics. There is a huge hole at the four and on the wing in Phoenix, making Jaylen Brown an option as a project pick and Chriss a sneaky candidate once again.</p>\n<p>Assuming Bender goes third, the Suns should go with Chriss, as he could potentially offer a more athletic option next to the plodding Alex Len in a future frontcourt. If Bledsoe is able to step up his defensive consistency and Len can develop better verticality at the rim, Chriss could be the defensive star that can mask Brandon Knight and Devin Booker on the wing.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Minnesota Timberwolves: Buddy Hield</strong></p>\n<p>Hield is the perfect fit for the Timberwolves, and it would be a dream for Minnesota fans if he were to fall to them at the No. 5 pick. With Rubio still the point guard of the future, accumulating shooting should be the priority for the Wolves around him and Karl-Anthony Towns.</p>\n<p>Hield and Murray are the two best shooters in the draft and will present Tom Thibodeau with a difficult decision as Murray could develop into a secondary ball handler, allowing the mercurial UCLA product Zach LeVine to stay at his natural two-guard position in the long term.</p>\n<p>Thibodeau will be interested in moving this developing team along, and Hield offers the best chance to solidify the shooting guard position for Minnesota, and, along with progress from Tyus Jones, the entire backcourt.</p>\n<p><strong>6) New Orleans Pelicans: Jamal Murray</strong></p>\n<p>An ideal course of events for the Pelicans, with Murray they grab their Eric Gordon replacement as well as an insurance plan for Jrue Holiday. The Pelicans are still in desperate need of bigs to play with Anthony Davis, but unless Bender or Chriss fall to them, there aren’t many viable options at six.</p>\n<p>Murray would provide a nice offensive option for Alvin Gentry, and his young age finally gives the Pelicans another lottery ticket after doing their best to rid themselves of all the ones they had at the start of the Anthony Davis era. Jaylen Brown could also be an interesting option for similar home-run potential reasons, though their need for shooting will outweigh the need for wing depth. Kris Dunn might be the best pick if Holiday is going to leave in a season, but the desire to win now will eschew the Pelicans from drafting the Providence star.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Denver Nuggets: Jaylen Brown</strong></p>\n<p>On a team filled with promising young players, Denver can afford to roll the dice on the raw Cal product Jaylen Brown to be its wing of the future. While his and Mudiay’s shooting might be untenable together on the court, the thought of those two cloaking the perimeter defensively has to strike fear into the minds of GMs around the league.</p>\n<p>Kris Dunn is still the best player on the board, but the Nuggets have Mudiay and creating a logjam at the point doesn’t seem to be in their best interest. Henry Ellenson could fit nicely next to Nikola Jokic and Jusef Nurkic, but more athleticism is probably warranted in an ideal four-five pairing.</p>\n<p><strong>8) Sacramento Kings: Kris Dunn</strong></p>\n<p>Another best-case scenario — this time for the Kings — Kris Dunn is an exquisite replacement for Rajon Rondo and would hopefully save Sacramento from doling out a big contract to the assist gorger. Dunn would finally give the Kings a young and talented option at point guard, and his consistent defense will be a welcomed addition for new coach Dave Joerger.</p>\n<p>Dunn has the ability to compete from day one and should pair perfectly with Cousins for a revamped Kings season in the new arena. Vlade Divac should have his heart set on the Providence talent with any player mock-drafted above him being a solid consolation prize.</p>\n<p><strong>9) Toronto Raptors: Denzel Valentine</strong></p>\n<p>With most of the big potential guys off the board (Jaylen Brown, Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender), the Raptors should go with a player who can solve many of the issues that are causing them to crater against Cleveland.</p>\n<p>Valentine was a solid three-point shooter in his final two collegiate seasons, with a free throw percentage above 80 percent via <em>Sports-reference.com</em>, suggesting that he’ll be able to continue that production in the NBA. Valentine is also a suburb passer, providing a cure for the Raptors’ inability to move the ball on offense. He gives them some DeMar DeRozan insurance as far as ball-handling, and even if they bring back the USC alumni, Valentine could still perform immediately in a role off the bench.</p>\n<p><strong>10) Milwaukee Bucks: Deyonta Davis</strong></p>\n<p>The Bucks are in need of a center to play with their young guns on the wing, and so far Greg Monroe has not fit the part. Davis’ ability to protect the rim and potential to be a solid rim runner make this a good value pick for the Bucks. He’s still young enough to have dominant upside, and his defensive potential is what the Bucks need next to Jabari Parker who may possibly be a terrible defender his entire career.</p>\n<p>Though Jakob Poeltl might be the better player in a vacuum, Davis’ athleticism makes him a better fit for the switching of the Bucks run on defense. If his jumper continues to develop, he could even play some spot minutes alongside Greg Monroe, covering up the big man’s defensive weaknesses.</p>\n<p><strong>11) Orlando Magic: Skal Labissiere</strong></p>\n<p>Labissiere gives the Magic another shot at blue-chip talent, and if he were to pan out, he is a perfect fit next to either Aaron Gordon or Nikola Vucevic. His shooting would open the floor for both big men, and his potential shot blocking would cover up for Vucevic’s defensive failures.</p>\n<p>The Magic hope to do well in free agency, and with Frank Vogel’s impact on a young, improving roster they should be back in the playoffs next season. The Magic have a great young core two to four players deep, ergo they can aim high for a guy who many had ranked as the presumptive No. 1 pick going into the college season.</p>\n<p><strong>12) Utah Jazz: Wayne Baldwin IV</strong></p>\n<p>An impressive ball handler who plays with energy, Baldwin was one of the most prolific overall college players statistically in 2015-16 according to Kevin Pelton of <em>ESPN.com</em>. Baldwin gives the Jazz depth in Exum’s first season back from a torn ACL, and if both players improve their shot somewhat, they could play together in a lineup with two capable, aggressive ball-handlers.</p>\n<p>While shooting guards Furkan Korkmaz and Malachi Richardson possibly offer a wider range of potential and give Utah the ability to amass depth on the wing. Point guard was the biggest issue for the Jazz last year and they should look to address that problem with another young building block.</p>\n<p><strong>13) Phoenix Suns: Henry Ellenson</strong></p>\n<p>The Suns grab a talented prospect in Ellenson, who may well go in the top ten, but they seem too slow on defense and may be defined as too one-dimensional at the four to warrant such a high selection. That said, the young power forward is very skilled, has a decent shooting touch and, at nineteen years old, could develop into a steal at the 13th spot for Phoenix.</p>\n<p><strong>14) Chicago Bulls: Jakob Poeltl</strong></p>\n<p>Poeltl is a great fit for a semi-rebuilding Bulls team in need of a replacement for the free-agent Pau Gasol. The center out of Utah has a short standing reach and wingspan, along with an old-school game that makes him undraftable in the top 10. In a defined role, however, he could develop into the big body that Nikola Mitotic needs alongside him in order to be effective. If Poeltl can continue to refine his body and give arduous effort while on the floor, the Bulls could end up with the best center in the draft with the final lottery selection.</p><div

morning, when his charges were dropped to two misdemeanor charges of stalking and vandalism. </span><em>Sophia Lovell / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third-year student, Dante Linden, is suspended indefinitely until a Title IX investigation is completed, according to Alexis — the student that reported that Linden was stalking her, who the Nexus is referring to with her first name only to protect her privacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she was informed about his suspension by the Office of Student Conduct. When asked about Linden’s status as a student, university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said the university was “prohibited by law and policy from discussing the specifics of this case.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fall 2019 was Linden’s first quarter at UCSB, according to student verification records. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linden was being held on a $150,000 bail at the Santa Barbara County Jail until his arraignment on Tuesday morning, when his charges were dropped to two misdemeanor charges of stalking and vandalism. His bail was also reduced to $2,500, which he posted, and he was subsequently released Tuesday evening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judicial officer in the case, Judge Clifford R. Anderson III, made Linden’s bail contingent on his compliance with a criminal protective order that was filed the same day, which orders Linden not to contact or come within 150 yards of Alexis. Alexis said she also requested a no-contact order through the Office of Student Conduct on campus on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, Alexis said she first met Linden on Tinder at the beginning of the school year and “hooked up” with him approximately three times over the course of a week and a half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t think it was a big deal, and [he] wasn’t even the only person I was seeing or anything like that,” she said. “After that, he was just kind of weird, and not really my type … so I just cut him off, like I just ghosted him, like you do in that situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when Linden’s behavior became unstable, and he began to send her threatening and vulgar messages, Alexis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’d be like, ‘Fuck you, you’re with another guy’ or something. And I was just like, okay, [I] blocked [him] on Snapchat, like that’s easy,” she said. “And then … he was on my Instagram, saying, ‘Why did you block me?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After blocking Linden on multiple platforms, Alexis said he then began texting her, asking her to come over, what she was doing and if he could come over to her place, she said. Initially, Alexis didn’t respond, but said she eventually told Linden: “Dude, I don’t feel the same way about you; I’m talking to someone else so, yeah, leave me alone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though she later blocked him on iMessage, Alexis said the block didn’t transfer over to her laptop, where he continued to harass her.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He sent me … like 25 texts, [a] message poem thing saying, ‘I like the way your eyes moved.’ Like ‘Oh my dear Alexis.’ Like really weird stuff,” she said. “This Friday, I was talking to my friend on FaceTime and I get this random FaceTime call …  and I answer it and it’s him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she immediately ended the call, but Linden kept calling and texting her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At that point I was like, stop talking to me, you’re stalking me, I’m going to report it. And he was like, ‘Alright, do it, I don’t care. Tell the feds, I don’t care,’ just kind of making a joke about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later that night, while Alexis was out of town, Linden allegedly came to her room in San Rafael Hall and starting loudly knocking on her suite’s door at around midnight, according to her roommates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He had [either] cut himself prior — or was cutting himself then — and wrote his name in blood on my door,” Alexis said. “And then he was scratching his nails in my door, like his name and then my name.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, Alexis’ roommates found her name and his name written on the door together in a red substance that looked like blood; Alexis provided the Nexus with a picture of the door.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They sent me a picture ‘cause I was [out of town],” Alexis said. “I saw it and I automatically had a panic attack, like I was freaking out, I was shaking, I was crying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minutes after hearing what Linden had done, Alexis made a phone call to the UCSB Police Department to report what had happened. Linden was subsequently arrested with a warrant the next afternoon near the Santa Ynez apartments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis also spoke to a San Rafael resident assistant, Dallana Jimenez, who advised her through the next steps. Jimenez also reported the incident to San Rafael Assistant Resident Director Jesse Rodriguez, who later informed Alexis in an email that he had filed a Clery Act report and Title IX report, “as is required of [his] job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to a question about why the university had not sent out an alert to the student body when notified of the incident, Estrada said in an email that “</span><b>Timely Warnings</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are issued when certain crimes (see</span> <a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/sites/www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/clery-act-crime-definitions.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act Crime Definitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) that occurred on UCSB-associated property (see</span> <a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/sites/www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/clery-act-geography.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act Geography</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) are considered a serious or continuing threat to the campus community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The decision to issue a Timely Warning is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the facts surrounding the Clery Act crime, including, but not limited to, such factors as: the nature of the crime, the serious or continuing threat to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts,” Estrada said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days following Linden’s arrest, Alexis consulted the Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E) to learn more about the resources and services available to her in dealing with the aftermath of experiencing a stalker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis said she also consulted with Victims Advocates in the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s office, who aided her in working out the legal end of her situation. She also said the university had offered to move her into a different dorm, but that she declined the offer, telling the Nexus that it “doesn’t do anything — if he wanted to find me, he could.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis, who said she “almost didn’t go to the C.A.R.E office,” walked in after those close to her helped change her mind; she was immediately connected with an advocate to help talk her through her situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following her appointment, Alexis said her advocate was “super helpful,” encouraging her to explore all possible options and recommending that she take her situation to the attention of the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[C.A.R.E. staff] were all really, really friendly. [My advocate] was really helpful with me. She’s helping me get an attorney [and] do this whole process.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When consulting survivors involved in situations involving legal matters, C.A.R.E assumes the role of a “liaison,” providing them with the support to take their situation to the police or Title IX through “informed decisions” facilitated by C.A.R.E, according to C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The criminal justice system is really complicated … [and] the campus reporting system is pretty complicated,” which makes dealing with harassment and stalking particularly difficult, Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A major function of our role is that liaison role, especially around following up from these entities to get updates: ‘So what’s the status of this person’s case? What are the next steps? When can they expect to hear from you again?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s really where our expertise and understanding of trauma comes into play and being able to understand how processes … re-victimize and can re-traumatize. So sometimes C.A.R.E’s role is to promote and help things happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E operates on the basis of “services,” which Conway defines as “any interaction between a client and an advocate.” A service could be as simple as a short meeting, Conway said, or more extensive — such as going to accompany a survivor for “restraining order paperwork” or an interview at the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In respects to stalking, Conway said the “threat of fear” is a lot more common in survivors, especially in situations involving a high “volume” of harassment, which can be difficult to shake off when “peace and security” is all they want.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The elements that make stalking stick out a little bit differently than the other forms of violence that we serve is around the electronic component of it,” Conway said. “All they want is the behavior to stop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the pervasiveness of stalking through texting and social media, Conway said that it’s easy for people to feel violated when stalkers find a way to circumvent their boundaries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My whole family is obviously freaking the fuck out,” Alexis said. “I called my mom crying, like, can you imagine, can you imagine?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can you imagine your daughter calling you, telling you [that] someone wrote in blood on her door? Like a stalker? It’s crazy,” she said. “[My parents] were really scared, and they kind of want me to come home and it’s crazy that that’s even an option, like that’s what I have to do [to feel safe], go home.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
