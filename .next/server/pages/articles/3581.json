Newsom Announces Proposed 2020-21 Budget (<em><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/01/14/ca-gov-newsom-announces-proposed-state-budget/\">Daily Californian</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget includes $36 billion for higher education, including community colleges, CSUs and the UC system. This is a $110 million increase compared to last year and specifically increases the UC General Fund by $217 million. The budget also includes $84 billion for K-12 schools and $750 million for a new state fund. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz: Continued Striking at UC Santa Cruz (<em><a href=\"https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/01/10/skilled-craft-workers-launch-indefinite-strike/\">City on a Hill Press</a></em>) </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Wednesday, the UC Santa Cruz American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) K7 workers were on their ninth day of striking; they announced earlier this month that striking would continue until the university presented them a contract that delivers “liveable standards.” K7 includes over 50 employees on the UCSC campus, such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters and HVAC mechanics. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCLA: UCLA Rejects Proposal for Students Experiencing Homelessness (<em><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/15/ucla-rejects-parking-space-proposal-for-students-experiencing-homelessness/\">Daily Bruin</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA rejected a proposal from the North Westwood Neighborhood Council and the Undergraduate Students Association Council, calling it “unsanitary” for students to sleep in their cars on campus. Instead, the administration suggested a “hostel-like” environment where students pay $15 per night. A small-scale version of the hostel program would include 100 beds and could potentially begin as soon as Fall Quarter 2020. The councils also called on UCLA administration to collect more data on students experiencing homelessness. Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck said in the meeting that it is difficult to identify students facing homelessness versus housing insecurity. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine: Irvine’s Housing Crisis (<em><a href=\"https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/01/13/irvines-housing-crisis-how-housing-insecurity-is-affecting-both-students-and-residents-in-irvine/\">New University</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New University looked back on housing trends over 2019, where increasing prices have led to lower home sales and greater housing insecurity for students and low-income people. These trends are coupled with lack of homeless resources, as earlier this year Irvine (along with four other Orange County cities) was sued for mistreatment of homeless people and lack of shelters in the city. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

local event, strictly local,’” now-former Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Ken Shemwell said of Halloween in Isla Vista in a 1992 Daily Nexus article. “‘[In the late 80’s] though, people from out of town came to party and trash the town, they didn’t really care. They were going to be here for one or two days and go home.’”</p>\n<p>According to a 1993 Santa Barbara County Action Plan Report, people from Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and all over California flocked to the area for the weekend-long celebration. Over 70 out-of-town schools were represented among the arrested and cited students.</p>\n<p>‘For young people in the age group of 14-26 years, Isla Vista has become ‘the place to be’ on Halloween,” the report said.</p>\n<p><strong>“Big, Destructive and Dangerous”</strong></p>\n<p>The early 90’s saw a huge increase of Halloween attendees, accidents and arrests.</p>\n<p>Michael Young, vice chancellor of Student Affairs, said he had heard rumors of the wild revelry when he started working at UCSB in 1990.</p>\n<p>“Halloween celebrations had gotten way too big, destructive and dangerous,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to the Office of Student Life administrative files, 853 of 25,000 attendees were arrested in 1991. Of the offenders, 80 percent were out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>That same year, two people fell off the cliffs and two deputies were injured while on duty.</p>\n<p>Despite growing concern from the community, Halloween of 1992 fell on a Saturday and no serious moves were made by the county or university to stop the event.</p>\n<p>That year also had the second most arrests and citations in Halloween history — 1,090 out of 40,000 attendees, 95 percent of which were for alcohol violations. Again, two people fell off the cliffs, including a teenager who fell 65 feet from the 6600 block of Del Playa.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara Sherriff Summary Reports, Halloween 1992 cost the county approximately $100,000 in law enforcement overtime alone.</p>\n<p>“It was a particularly bad Halloween that year [1992] and a decision was made, and made by the county, that they needed to, if not put an end to it, then certainly bring it down to more acceptable levels,” Young said.</p>\n<p><strong>What Caused The Change? The Infamous Playboy Article… That Wasn’t</strong></p>\n<p>A letter from Sherriff Jim Thomas to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors in September 1993 explained why he thought the party boomed.</p>\n<p>“In the mid 1980’s, the news media descended on Halloween in Isla Vista and made it into a nationwide media event. Major television newscasters and publications such as Playboy magazine did extensive coverage of the ‘party,’” the letter said. “Halloween evolved from a local holiday spirit event to the largest college party in California.”</p>\n<p>A number of Daily Nexus articles in addition to reports in the La Cumbre yearbook and The Santa Barbara News-Press also attributed the spike in attendance to a mid-80s Playboy article that listed Isla Vista as a top spot to celebrate Halloween.</p>\n<p>While researching for her 2006 dissertation on Halloween in I.V., then-UCSB Ph.D. student Adrienne MacIan said she encountered a number of interviewees who noted that the infamous magazine was instrumental in the weekend’s infamy.</p>\n<p>“Everyone told me, ‘Things got really out of control after that Playboy article,’” MacIan said.</p>\n<p>In a Daily Nexus poll issued last week, 52 percent said they thought Halloween in IV became a renowned event “In the late 80’s after Playboy ran an article on the event.”</p>\n<p>In actuality, the article is nothing more than an urban myth. There is no evidence of its existence in any Playboy magazine from 1985 through 1992.</p>\n<p>MacIan said all of the individuals who claimed they had seen the story later admitted they had, in fact, only seen a Xeroxed copy of a list. None had seen the actual article in the magazine.</p>\n<p>According to MacIan, a student most likely perpetrated the rumor as a practical joke.</p>\n<p>“There was a whole urban legend built up around this thing that nobody ever bothered to check,” MacIan said.</p>\n<p><strong>The Five Year Plan</strong></p>\n<p>“We, at times, had busloads of people from other campus come here, get trashed, trash the place…and then leave,” Young said. “…What I felt, and what certainly many people in the leadership community felt, was that we should not encourage people to be here and we should warn people that the county had made a set of judgments that it was no longer going to tolerate certain kinds of behaviors.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Grand Jury issued an investigation and, subsequently, recommended that the Board of Supervisors take action to halt the event.</p>\n<p>“…Many county government officials recognized that the Halloween ‘college party’ in Isla Vista was no longer an event that can be sanctioned, condoned, chaperoned or tolerated by this County,” a 1993 County Action Summary Report said.</p>\n<p>Local law enforcement drafted the “Five Year Plan” to limit the number of revelers that flocked to I.V. the next Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>The procedure included a “no tolerance policy” in addition to a festival ordinance that forbade outdoor music from 6 p.m. onward during the weekend, the confiscation of any costume prop that could be used as a weapon, barricading five main entrances into Isla Vista, restricting parking on Del Playa and Sabado Tarde from Oct. 29 until Nov. 1 and implementing pre-Halloween regulations as early as the first week of September.</p>\n<p>“Arrests were up, citations were down and Isla Vistans agreed it was a very different Halloween experience from years past…” Brett Chapman wrote in a 1993 Daily Nexus article. “Operational changes for 1993 included making custody arrests whenever possible, exacting higher fines for infractions and strictly enforcing a ban on live and amplified prerecorded music.”</p>\n<p>Whether increased police presence or the fact that Halloween fell on a Sunday was more influential, the weekend saw only approximately 25,000 partiers. According to Office of Student Life files, 966 arrests were made, of which 93 percent were out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>Some students reacted against the new regulations and there were rumors that an abandoned apartment complex on Del Playa would be the target of arson on Halloween weekend. However, overall, reports noted that “officers observed a compliance to the laws and ordinances that were being enforced.”</p>\n<p>From 1993 onward, the numbers of attendees decreased and stayed low for almost a decade. In 1995, only 1,750 joined in the notorious street party, and both the administration and county officials started to think that the final nail was in the coffin for Halloween altogether.</p>\n<p>“I think it actually had an effect for a couple of years,” Young said. “But then the activity and the numbers began to creep up again.”</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit id=13831 align=”alignleft” width=”163″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"298412871\" data-slb-group=\"28206\"><img data-attachment-id=\"28208\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/cop_gives_ticketjs/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=2175%2C3316&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2175,3316\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"cop_gives_ticket(JS)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=164%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=672%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS-163x250.jpg?resize=163%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"cop_gives_ticket(JS)\" width=\"163\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-28208\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span><strong>Halloween On The Rise</strong></p>\n<p>Exactly 10 years after the “Five Year Plan” was first implemented, 40,000 flocked the streets to celebrate Halloween — the same number of people that were at the disastrous 1992 event that initially inspired the stricter enforcements.</p>\n<p>According to Chancellor Henry Yang, the number of attendees varies greatly depending on what day Halloween falls on. Halloween 2003, for instance, fell on a Friday.</p>\n<p>“The Halloween celebration in Isla Vista does change from year to year, partly in response to whether Halloween falls on a weekend,” Yang said in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>Young speculated that other factors may have a hand in Halloween’s resurrection.</p>\n<p>“Frankly, I think the internet and Facebook and the ability of people to communicate and for ideas to go viral and for whole communities of people to find out about something … it sort of catches on,” he said. “I think that there’s something to be said for modern social media. I think that the press also continues to dredge up things … up until recent years, people felt compelled to drive trucks up from Los Angeles to here to broadcast about Halloween. If the media makes noise about something, then people will to come and participate in it.”</p>\n<p>The Office of Student Life also “made some noise” about Halloween when it sent out a university-wide e-mail entitled, “The party is over.” The message, which included the line “There is NO party,” attempted to deter students from celebrating Halloween.</p>\n<p>However, Young admitted that perhaps the university’s anti-Halloween campaign might have, ironically, actually encouraged out-of-towners to join in the festivities.</p>\n<p>“As I think about it, some people could see [the university’s past involvement] as counterproductive,” Young said. “People want to come to something that you say they shouldn’t come to … But my sense is that these kinds of activities have grown all over the country … there’s something in our culture that, at this time, makes these kinds of events appealing for young people.”</p>\n<p>In 2004 the university took a new approach to controlling Halloween with the ‘Keep it Safe, Keep it Local” campaign. Instead of trying to deter students altogether, administrators encouraged students to celebrate Halloween without outsiders.</p>\n<p>Last year, IVFP records say that there were 25,000 Halloween attendees, a modest number for IV. However, 2009 did set a record with 1,013 arrests and citations — the third most arrests in Halloween history.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it was estimated in the Daily Nexus that Halloween 2009 was going to cost the county and sate approximately $1 million.</p>\n<p>That year, stricter parking regulations and a no-visitor policy in the dormitories were enforced.</p>\n<p>In 2004, Maxim deemed IV one of the top places in the nation to celebrate Halloween — finally bringing the Playboy myth to fruition.</p>\n<p>Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said, while running for her current position in 2008, she asked if she could walk along with members of the IVFP for Halloween.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to see it for myself,” she said. “…I actually thought that, despite the crowd, everything seemed to be handled as well as possible.”</p>\n<p>Aside from several incidents of students jumping off roofs, Farr said that there “seemed to be a good working relationship between the Foot Patrol and the students.”</p>\n<p>Despite encouragement from Associated Students, the university administration and the county to keep the event local, out-of-towners still flock to the 2.1 square mile beach town every year to wander the streets.</p>\n<p>“…Everyone knows that Santa Barbara is the ultimate party spot for Halloween,” Levi Burridge, a 19-year old Fairfield resident, said in the Daily Nexus. “…This place is where I know we can all get down and party it up with everyone in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p><strong>CHECK OUT TOMORROW’S NEXUS FOR PART THREE OF THE SERIES: 2010</strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28206\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28206\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/","id":3578,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3577,3576,3575],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Who Knew Going to Class Could Feel This Good?","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Getting bored in class?

One person had heard of the plans, but knew no additional information.</p>\n<p>The respective projects both have running starts, but do they have what it takes to get off the ground?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Associated Students’ Sustainable Restaurant</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Associated Students plans to invest a quarter of a million dollars of student money to establish an organic, local food operation at 6521 Pardall Rd.</p>\n<p>The restaurant — which would take over the space of the now-defunct On The Side — would produce approximately 35 to 50 student jobs and, while it would create revenue, would not be run on a strictly profit-generating platform. Legislative Council representatives Fabian Gallardo and Stanley Tzankov, an A.S. presidential candidate, started pushing the enterprise last quarter.</p>\n<p>While delegates indicated that the $250,000 is being loaned out for the plan from a reserve account under the control of Business Services, as of press time, student representatives have given the Daily Nexus conflicting reports about the money’s source.</p>\n<p>The four students of the Business Services committee — including Gallardo, the committee chair — voted in favor of the loan, Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>“The reserve account was created in 2006 during the students’ initiative as a mandate for an environmental center,” Gallardo said. “A large focus of the restaurant will be towards environmental education, hence the strong involvement of the Student Food Collective.”</p>\n<p>However, A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez, said the Business Services loan is coming from the A.S. Bike Reserve — funds that were allocated a number of years ago for the A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>Part of the $250,000 will be allocated to an outside individual recommended by the A.S. attorney to create a business plan with the rest going toward “holding down” a lease, said Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President Jake Elwood said there was a discussion about loaning against other A.S. accounts.</p>\n<p>“We currently have an account devoted towards the construction of a permanent bike shop, since our current one is in a trailer,” Elwood said. “It was proposed that we could borrow against that money once it came time to actually pay [for the restaurant]. But that was a possible suggestion, and it hasn’t been acted on. So once we know exactly how much money it will cost to get into this, we’ll be able to have a few options about where to pull the funding from if we decide to go for it.”</p>\n<p>Following the Business Services’ decision, the Associated Students Legislative Council approved the loan as a resolution, said Tzankov. However, during an in-person interview Tzankov said that the Legislative Council members “don’t always go through the minutes.”</p>\n<p>Because the restaurant has the potential to generate revenue, A.S. External Vice President for Local Affairs Cori Lantz said the proponents moved forward without configuring a final budget.</p>\n<p>“I have mentioned it was hard for groups to fund money [for the annex project], and the groups are getting something out of it,” Lantz said. “I’m not sure where the money [for the restaurant] is going to come from. I’m not sure how they’re going to pull it off.”</p>\n<p>However, Rodriguez said the restaurant is not necessarily guaranteed to generate a surplus.</p>\n<p>“It has been calculated that the first year we will be breaking even but every year after that would be going to paying back the loan,” Rodriguez said. “This business isn’t designed to profit necessarily, but it’s designed to provide a service for students.”</p>\n<p>Tzankov confirmed that a budget is still in the works.</p>\n<p>“The restaurant has a lot of potential to generate a stable source of revenue,” Tzankov said. “The projections in our most current business plan are highly dependent on what menu we decide to craft in the following months and therefore, no accurate estimate can be provided at this time; however, that information will be public as soon as it is finalized.”</p>\n<p>Proponents of the café are currently looking into other sources of funds.</p>\n<p>“We have applied to several grants, including an $80,000 grant from The Green Initiative Fund that will go towards the production of the cart and improvements on the building and are pursuing more options from foundations and nonprofits,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>According to the café supporters, excess funds from the restaurant may be recycled back to A.S. — but plans are still up in the air.</p>\n<p>“This coming year, [the A.S.] budget is looking a lot tighter than it has been in the past,” Elwood said. “There have been a few reasons for that, but the base reason is that the university is not covering our benefits anymore, which increased our yearly costs about $400,000. It’s a big jump that we’ve never had to deal with. I’d imagine that [money from the restaurant] could go to back to the general fund that we distribute evenly throughout the association, but I don’t think it’s really been discussed.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For the past few years, the restaurants at 6521 Pardall Rd. have not done well. On The Side was open for about six months before turning over to Dirty’s Barbeque and Brew Shack, which Tzankov estimated was open a mere two months.</p>\n<p>However, Gallardo said the previous establishments’ losses can be attributed mostly to poor management.</p>\n<p>“From information provided to us about the last couple businesses we can tell that they were somewhat successful,” Gallardo said. “They weren’t necessarily losing money; they just weren’t making a lot.  A lot of these businesses that showed up weren’t locally managed, they were usually setup by investors from L.A. or SF.”</p>\n<p>Gallardo also said A.S. plans to physically change the building to attract customers.</p>\n<p>“We would like to open up the space more, allow more natural lighting, larger lounge areas and expansion of the outdoor patio with added photovoltaic solar panels,” Gallardo said. “We hope to change the current image of a ‘haunted building’ — read that in the Nexus a few days ago — to a much more livelier hangout spot for students.”</p>\n<p>Proponents remain optimistic about the restaurant’s potential. According to Gallardo, the restaurant will provide healthier food options than the average Isla Vista restaurant.</p>\n<p>“We will put into place as many sustainable practices for our restaurant at its opening as possible, and continually upgrade our facilities to fit the mission of an environmentally conscious business,” Gallardo said in an e-mail. “We hope to create precedent for future businesses in Isla Vista in both their quality of food and how they do business.”</p>\n<p>Gallardo said the sustainable café will act as an educational resource and local dig for the community.</p>\n<p>“It will provide students with a space to come in and hangout, relax, read a book — kind of something along the lines of what the Hub is supposed to be, but with the intimacy it lacks,” Gallardo said.</p>\n<p>Because of the restaurant’s structure, it would function differently than other I.V. establishments, Elwood said.</p>\n<p>“First of all, the model that it’s being built on is so that eventually, if it were to be successful, it would exist to support itself,” Elwood said. “It wouldn’t be interested in making a profit, per se. Because of that, the food and services that came from the business would be much more fairly priced than other places in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Rodriguez also said the space could be used for community events such as lectures, concerts or open mic nights.</p>\n<p>All legal documents for the lease have been submitted to the office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang and are waiting approval of the Chancellor and possibly the Regents, said Gallardo.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately we have to clear a lot more hurdles than the average person trying to open up their own business,” Gallardo said.</p>\n<p>Despite controversy surrounding this endeavor, Gallardo said, he “wouldn’t want to tell any student to do anything [he] knew for a fact they didn’t want.”</p>\n<p>“At this point, it has been students telling us through surveys done by both Associated Students and the Student Food Collective that this is what they want,” Gallardo said. “They’re tired of hamburgers and burritos. If I encountered a student who was not happy with our decision to pursue a sustainable café and somehow had to convince him/her otherwise, I’d start by showing them the statistical information on food options in IV and the dissatisfaction students are having.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Associated Students’ Community Annex</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The A.S. EVPLA’s office has fought alongside partner groups to establish an annex in Isla Vista, but now their plans are hanging in the balance.</p>\n<p>EVPLA Cori Lantz said she hopes that the community center will be established in the 4,270 square foot area above the I.V. Medical Clinic at 570 Embarcadero del Mar. The annex would house 15 boards, commissions and committees — nine of which currently have no office space at all.</p>\n<p>“In order to get this entire thing up and running” Lantz said the building will cost $82,060 per year. Approximately $51,250 is allocated for rent, with the remainder funding utilities, supplies and staff and student salaries.</p>\n<p>“It sounds like a huge number,” Lantz said. “But it’s actually very reasonable.”</p>\n<p>C.A.B. allocated $24,000 for the space and the IVCRC has promised that they will contribute $2,000 every month to the annex rent upon establishment.</p>\n<p>However, the project still needs $34,560. Lantz asked the A.S. Financial Board for money, but was turned down.</p>\n<p>“For reasons I’m not sure of, they decided it was too much money,” Lantz said. “Which is frustrating because there are one-day events that cost just as much [as funding the building for an entire year].”</p>\n<p>Lantz is now asking groups with surplus funds for this year to contribute to the community center fund.</p>\n<p>According to Lantz, many of the 15 groups that hope to move into the annex may not be able to continue their work if this space is not provided.</p>\n<p>“It is nearly impossible for groups to expand and grow without an office,” Lantz said. “This is not a luxury at this point, this is a necessity.”</p>\n<p>The annex would also house a number of other community amenities including a computer lab, community garden, space for off-campus representatives to hold office hours, a recreation room and a kitchen where C.A.B. could cook breakfasts for the homeless.</p>\n<p>According to IVCRC Chair Megan Shumate, her group is one of the project’s biggest supporters.</p>\n<p>“I have been involved in making sure this project is made a priority because there are several committees in Associated Students that do not have a space, and it makes it extremely difficult to help the committee grow and achieve all of its goals to their full potential,” Shumate said in an e-mail. “IVCRC has been one of the biggest supporters of the I.V. Annex because it not only gives us a solid place to meet and have an office, but it also gives us a chance to reach out to our community members, especially those which aren’t students.”</p>\n<p>However, money is not the only problem the annex supporters face.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of work to do before we can make it a reality,” Elwood said. “I think that the idea of it is fantastic, but there have been a lot of hurdles getting there. Right now, it’s hard for me to say whether it will happen.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang recently mandated that A.S. needs to get approval from the UC Regents before signing any new lease in Isla Vista. Furthermore, Governor Brown’s current budget proposal calls for the dissolution of all Redevelopment Agencies in California. If this happens, the local Redevelopment Agency — which is responsible for the Isla Vista Master Plan and manages the annex property — may no longer exist.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are about 10 groups that allocate money from property taxes. Without the Redevelopment Agency, there would only be nine groups that, according to Lantz, are less savvy on fighting for Isla Vista improvements.</p>\n<p>“We would still be paying into property taxes, but getting nothing out of it,” Lantz said. “Any type of fiscal improvement [in Isla Vista] comes from the RDA.”</p>\n<p>Originally, A.S. planned to move into the building in the beginning of March. Now, Lantz says, the project cannot progress until sometime in early June after the next UC Regents meeting.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the tentative plans for the Anisq’ Oyo’ Master Plan redevelopment include expanding the park by tearing down a number of buildings including Rosarito, Naan Stop, the St. Athanasius Orthodox Church — and the space that Lantz hopes will be used for the annex.</p>\n<p>“I have had some reservations as we’ve moved forward,” EVPLA County Liaison and A.S. EVPLA candidate Tim Benson said in an e-mail. “I question the timing of the investment since the building is scheduled to be torn down within the next two years, and we face a likely chance of being kicked out of the building as soon as November.”</p>\n<p>Another question is whether the annex will be fully utilized by the students. According to Benson, A.S. does need to become more visible to the student population, but he is unsure of whether the annex would be the best option.</p>\n<p>“The genesis of putting an A.S. space in Isla Vista was the idea that a majority of UCSB students live in I.V. and a majority of their time is spent in I.V., so an annex in I.V. would be a great stride in making a more accessible and more visible association,” Benson said. “However, we could run into the same overarching issue of student apathy. We shouldn’t fund a large project if students won’t utilize it. I question how visible the building will be as it is tucked behind a row of businesses.”</p>\n<p>Despite the setbacks, Lantz said she and others would continue supporting the project.</p>\n<p>“We are still moving forward,” Lantz said. “We are looking into alternative spaces, but none would be as good. We’re going to continue fighting for that space.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36225\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36225\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/spending-money/","id":3580,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3579,3578,3577],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
