The discussion touched on a variety of topics relating to cannabis, but primarily served as an additional step in the community involvement process leading to the opening of a dispensary in I.V. in about a year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two speakers were UCSB alumni Lauren Vazquez, a lawyer specializing in cannabis law, and Devon Wardlow, director of public affairs for Santa Barbara cannabis retailer Coastal Dispensary. They spoke extensively about cannabis use in I.V., noting that the next step toward bringing a recreational dispensary in I.V. is through community outreach.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vasquez explained that because the licensing process in I.V. for recreational dispensaries is ranked, community impact counts as the second most important factor in the ranking process. The financial viability of the business is ranked first, but Santa Barbara County is using a merit-based system to determine which businesses get the recreational marijuana licenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county will be holding a meeting in I.V. within the coming months to gauge input from the community — specifically what residents would like out of a local dispensary and how the dispensary would contribute to improving the community, according to Vazquez. The next meeting is tentatively scheduled for the end of April, according to Gina Fischer, an aide to Santa Barbara county supervisor Joan Hartmann.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow said that Coastal Dispensary, which already has locations in Lompoc, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara, is going to compete for the spot in I.V. and is putting together a community benefits package for the dispensary’s pitch based off of the feedback she gets from talking to I.V. residents. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You guys have a ton of power in ensuring that somebody that comes to this community actually represents your community, and it’s actually going to do something helpful for you,” she said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow said she couldn’t discuss certain details of the potential community benefits package due to the ongoing licensing process, but added that she believes a dispensary could benefit the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The way I would propose it is that a portion of the cannabis taxes and revenue that comes from this store is funneled back into Isla Vista versus going into the general fund at the county,” Wardlow said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Wardlow acknowledged that appropriating the dispensary’s funds away from the county and into the I.V. CSD would be difficult, and that all current plans Coastal Dispensary has regarding its community benefits package are subject to change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I.V. CSD President Spencer Brandt said that he can not comment on any ideas from the competing dispensaries regarding their community benefits packages, he added that he believes that the upcoming cannabis store will aid I.V.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’ll be a huge benefit to the community to have an additional revenue source because that’s money that should go right back into things that will fund our community facilities and programming for students and residents, our roads, sidewalks and street lights and our local schools,” Brandt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ellie Hurtado, a fourth-year communication major and president of SSDP, said that she’d like the tax revenue from a dispensary to go toward helping I.V. families, as well as students who experience food and housing insecurity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she would like to see more money for local youth programs such as the St. George Youth Center YMCA.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hurtado noted that while recreational cannabis is both legal and accessible for Isla Vistans who are 21 years old and older, with many residents ordering from dispensaries in Goleta and downtown Santa Barbara, the primary impact of a local dispensary would be the tax revenue it generates. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista has the opportunity through the county to be a really shining star in a larger ecosystem that is the central coast cannabis industry,” Wardlow said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

To some extent, their calls seem to have been heard.</p>\n<p>Hannah-Beth Jackson, Santa Barbara’s state senator representing California’s 19th district and author of SB 1346, optimistically expressed approval for the new gun control laws.</p>\n<p>Although these laws encompass the entire state, UCSB’s past experience with gun violence oftentimes compels many local leaders and students to be more vocal about their opinions on the issue of gun control.</p>\n<p>In May 2014, a violent attack in I.V. left six people dead. Half died due to gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p>“[UCSB] students will support these laws by being reminded that we need to do more — this will give them an incentive to call for more action, particularly at the federal level to combat gun violence,” Jackson said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>Combating gun violence has been an ongoing initiative in California, highlighted by legislative action taken by former California Governor Jerry Brown.</p>\n<p>While Gov. Brown did sign some bills addressing gun control, he also vetoed a number of them, some of which could have reduced the number of guns in the state, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>In the context of gun control, Jackson has high expectations for Gov. Newsom.</p>\n<p>“I expect him to be very supportive of policies that help reduce gun violence and keep our communities safe,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jackson believes her bump-stock bill, SB 1346, will have an impact in reducing gun violence by prohibiting access to bump stocks in California and will hopefully reduce the number of gun deaths in the state.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy to see that our representative Hannah Beth Jackson introduced SB 1346,” Jeike Meijer, Associated Students (A.S.) executive vice president of local affairs, said in an email.</p>\n<p>Meijer spoke at the vigil for the 11 lives lost in a Pittsburgh synagogue due to gun violence and then again at the vigil in remembrance of the Thousand Oaks shooting victims.</p>\n<p>Both mass shootings occurred in November.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’ll see the rest of the country follow California soon,” Meijer added.</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel, A.S. president, believes the new legislation will be effective.</p>\n<p>“[Gun violence] is always on people’s minds, on prospective students’ minds, and I think that these kinds of measures are exactly what we need to have students feel more comfortable and safe in Isla Vista,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>Kopel believes that SB 1100 specifically, which raises the minimum age to 21 to purchase a firearm, would make UCSB students more comfortable “knowing that the people around them can’t even purchase a firearm.”</p>\n<p>“Even though most of the students that are attending this university now weren’t here to experience the 2014 shooting, that legacy does live on through vigils and remembrances,” Kopel added.</p>\n<p>Still, Kopel finds that more work needs to be done and believes that a “cultural change” regarding guns is needed in the United States.</p>\n<div

done.</p>\n<p>Limón is specifically looking forward to the potential impacts of AB 3129, which imposes a lifetime ban on individuals convicted of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>“I am especially hopeful that AB 3129… will make an impact in reducing the rate of women and children who die at the hands of repeat domestic abusers,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, believes that California serves as a model for the rest of the country when it comes to gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“As a resident of Isla Vista, I feel like my voice has been heard and that our calls for reducing the amount of gun violence in this country are actually being taken seriously,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>While Brandt believes that California is an effective leader on gun control legislation, he does not think the federal government has been adequately following California’s lead.</p>\n<p>“The national government, under the Republican Party, has decided that they’re going to pretend like they can ignore this issue and it’ll just go away,” Brandt said. “I think that that philosophy is something that has never worked out well and never been viewed well by history.”</p>\n<p>“The federal government used to look to California as a model, because these are the sorts of bills that should be implemented nationally.”</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal said that he’s fighting for just that: he wants pieces of California gun control legislation to be laws of the nation.</p>\n<p>Carbajal plans to reintroduce the Gun Violence Restraining Act in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>“[The Gun Violence Restraining Act] allows family members, when they come across a loved one that seems to be, through their behavior, posing a danger to themselves or others… to work with law enforcement, officials and the court system to temporarily take guns away from [that individual],” Carbajal said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually similar to the one that California has in place that was enacted after the tragedy that happened in Isla Vista and UCSB, so it’s duplicating a similar law that exists in California.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal believes that the new California gun control legislation will enhance gun safety in California, and says he is “working to introduce similar legislation and be part of similar legislation introduced here in the House of Representatives.”</p>\n<p>“Far too many lives continue to be taken due to unnecessary gun use,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>“We need to make sure we are passing banning assault weapons, that we are banning high capacity magazines and that we move forward with universal background checks and the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act.”</p>\n<p><i>Correction [Jan. 17, 12:11 p.m.]: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article stated that most of the individuals killed in the I.V. attack died of gunshot wounds.

Sunday. <em>Courtesy of SBSO</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suspects, later identified as 18-year-old Devosia Harper and 20-year-old Elijah Francis, are not locals, according to Kelly Hoover, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson; Harper primarily resides in Stockton, while Francis is from Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both were reportedly in town for Deltopia, an unsanctioned street party that typically happens during the first weekend of UC Santa Barbara’s Spring Quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two were stopped after a UCSB police sergeant initially spotted their car driving without lights on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road around 11 p.m. on Sunday, Hoover said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After stopping the car, the sergeant called in assistance after smelling a “strong odor of marijuana emanating from within the vehicle” and discovering that the driver did not have any identification. A separate sergeant then recognized the car as one that had been used in an armed robbery in Santa Barbara City on Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon searching the vehicle, police found a firearm, a brick of cocaine, Xanax pills and five pounds of marjuana with packaging, according to Hoover. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also during this stop, two separate individuals approached the deputies to report that they had been robbed in I.V. It was then discovered that the suspects in the car were the same as those who had robbed the two victims in I.V. It was not indicated in the press release how that was discovered. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the victims had been pistol whipped on his head and had a large laceration over his eye that was bleeding,” Hoover said in a press release sent out Tuesday afternoon. “The investigation revealed the suspects in that crime were the same suspects involved in the vehicle stop.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full charges for both include robbery, attempted robbery, conspiracy, possession of a loaded firearm and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Harper was additionally charged with assault with a deadly weapon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both were booked at the Santa Barbara County Jail. Harper is currently being held on a $550,000 bail, but information about Francis’ bail was not immediately available. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
