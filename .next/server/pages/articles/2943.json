Womyn’s Commission appealed to reallocate over $5,000 in funds previously set aside for travel. Several funding measures were also passed, including Off-Campus Senators’ request to receive $100 for fliers and food for a forum this Friday as well as the Black Student Union’s request for $250 for the Black Coalition Conference’s registration fees and $1,035 for hotel costs for a group of 60 people.</p>\n<p>A member of the Excursion Club asked for a reallocation of funds, as the club wanted to put the $950 received last week to instead pay $100 each for the bands Sun Daes and Yancellor Chang as well as $750 for their equipment.</p>\n<p>“Once we realized what funding we would be getting from the Board we talked to the bands and they all need equipment, but we didn’t get any funding for equipment,” the Excursion Club member said. “It is pretty vital to our event because we really need the lighting to make it a safe event and the generators power the lights.”</p>\n<p>The Japanese Language Cafe asked for $420 for three events which are open to the public: a $100 karaoke potluck on Dec. 4 in the Multicultural Center Lounge, a $160 Winter BBQ at Goleta Beach on Jan 16 and a $160 Spring BBQ at Goleta Beach on April 11.</p>\n<p>Japanese Language Cafe President Eric Lee said the karaoke potluck would be a great final event for students graduating or returning home.</p>\n<p>“We think that it’s a great chance for everyone to get together and exchange cultures and many times at the end of the quarter some people are graduating or going back to Japan,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Finance and Business Committee Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus said the committee was unable to fund the event, as the club has already been funded for an off-campus event for the quarter.</p>\n<p>“We can’t fund you at all for your Goleta Beach events because you have used your one time exception for an off-campus event,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>Lee said the club would then only request $100 for the potluck this Thursday, but the committee said they would not fund the club’s potluck and suggested the club try to find place on campus for their other two events.</p>\n<p>Theus said the students should relocate the event in order to receive funding.</p>\n<p>“If you had it here on campus we could fund you for those two events,” Theus said, “so you can come back again because we can’t fund you for the rest of this quarter. Change from Goleta Beach to on campus.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair of the A.S. Womyn’s Commission Danielle Maldonado requested successfully that the committee approve the transfer of their $5,740 travel budget to special projects.</p>\n<p>“It has always been there, but we haven’t ever used any of it yet and I’m still leaving money in there in case it ever is needed,” Maldonado said. “The only conference that we’ve considered going to is UC Berkeley’s Empowering Women of Color, and it is during our finals week, so that’s really the only conference we wanted to go to. We have been looking this year but we haven’t found any.”</p>\n<p>Co-Presidents of the Art Club Janice Agustin and Lucy Maybank asked for $700 for the Honors’ Art Show this upcoming Spring and $1,050 for the Undergraduate Art Show in June 2015, stating they had not received funding from the university Art Department.</p>\n<p>Senator Esteni Dominguez explained the budget breakdown for the Art Club’s request to other Senators.</p>\n<p>“They are just asking for food, music and materials to put up and put down artwork,” Dominguez said, “The only reason why the second event is more is because they’re expecting double the amount of people coming for the second show.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

student performance of “HAIR the Musical” this weekend. Shrunken Heads Production Company, a student-run theatre group that organizes various musical performances, will be offering several showtimes throughout the weekend, with performances at Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at Campbell Hall. Sing along to hit rock songs from the musical including  “Aquarius,” “Good Morning Starshine” and “Let the Sunshine In” while following the story of a group of young friends who navigate the trials of everyday life against the backdrop of the military draft and Vietnam War. UCSB Students and military members can get in for free; students can buy tickets for $5.50 and general admission is $10.50.</p>\n<p><strong>Venom</strong></p>\n<p>If you missed it in the theatres, the film “Venom” is coming to Isla Vista Theatre this Tuesday, Jan. 22. UCSB students can enjoy showings either at 7 p.m. or 10 p.m. by showing their ACCESS card at the door. The movie presents an alternative storyline related to the original “Spiderman” in which a journalist by the name of Eddie Brock contracts a mutant organism while investigating the nefarious experiments of scientist Carlton Drake. Brock struggles throughout the movie to control the raging power and superhuman abilities he possesses while trying to prevent Venom from overpowering him. Be sure to bring snacks along with your friends to enjoy the movie in comfort.</p>\n<p><strong>Pajama Party!</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t let the rain keep you indoors this weekend! A couple local bands will brave the storm to perform live music for I.V. residents. Stop by to see Close Out, a three-member punk, reggae, alternative rock band from I.V. and Peach Gazebo, another local band this Friday at 6666 Sueno Rd. Party-goers are encouraged to come dressed in their comfiest onesie or pajamas to dance the night away in style. Peach Gazebo opens the show from 9:20 p.m to 10:20 p.m. and then Close Out will finish out the night from 9:30 p.m. to 12 a.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Shopping in Style </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re one of those people who still don’t use reusable bags when grocery shopping, you’re still in 2018. Update your shopping routine while learning about the latest in zero-waste grocery shopping from staff at the I.V. Food Co-op on 6575 Seville Rd. This upcoming Wednesday, Jan. 23, from 4 to 5:30 p.m., Co-Op Sustainability Coordinator Allison will provide information on how attendees can reduce their “shopping footprint.” The workshop includes tastings of zero-waste recipes as well as raffles to win reusable water bottles and containers. All participants will leave with a reusable shopping bag, so for that roommate who always asks to borrow yours, be sure to bring them along.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/vista-point-15/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/vista-point-15/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/vista-point-15/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/vista-point-15/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/vista-point-15/","id":2940,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2939,2938,2937],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Receives Record Amount of Student Applications","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Record-Applicants_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Record-Applicants_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB recorded its highest number of student applicants ever for the upcoming 2015-2016 school year this past Monday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Over 85,000 prospective students applied for the next academic year, with 18,420 students applying from outside of CA or the U.S.</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_59760\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59760\" data-attachment-id=\"59760\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/ucsb-receives-record-amount-of-student-applications/record-applicants_stephen-manga-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Record-Applicants_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416008395\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Record Applicants_Stephen Manga-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Record-Applicants_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Record-Applicants_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-59760\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Record-Applicants_Stephen-Manga-11-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"UCSB continues to attract more and more nternational students — even more than out-of-state hopefuls — as well as the most applications from African-American students out of the entire UC campus system.

UCSB also ranked second highest in the UC system for most African-American student applications.</p>\n<p>According to Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services Mary Jacob, the university’s 85,208 applications reflect a larger amount of non-California applicants than ever before, with 18,420 of the applications coming from out-of-state and international students.</p>\n<p>“We continue to attract students from outside California, from other states in the United States,  and even from other countries abroad,” Jacob said. “There’s interest outside of California from people who would like to study here and study specifically at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Jacob said 10,930 of the non-California applications were from international students, exceeding the 7,490 out-of-state applications. She said this is due to the U.S.’s greater availability of higher education in comparison to universities and colleges abroad which tend to be more competitive.</p>\n<p>“American students, no matter where they are, have a range of choices of good quality universities to apply to in the same country, and that may not always be the case for other countries,” Jacob said. “It’s too competitive for them to go to the really good universities in their home country, so they look to study abroad in the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia or Canada if they’re looking to go to an English-speaking country.”</p>\n<p>UCOP spokesperson Shelly Meron said despite California residents’ criticism of UCOP for increasing acceptance of non-Californians, these acceptances are financially necessary as higher out-of-state tuition will allow the UC to provide funding for resident students amidst recent state budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“Admitting non-resident students helps UC subsidize California students and make up for some of the significant cuts in state funding the university has experienced in the last few years,” Meron said. “It’s also important to note that non-resident students are not taking the place of California students at UC; these are separate enrollment targets.”</p>\n<p>Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships Michael M. Miller said the amount of financial aid students receive will not be affected significantly by the larger pool of applicants, as the university will continue to enroll a consistent number of students to allow the university to properly fund them.</p>\n<p>“The campus is really good about hitting all our enrollment targets,” Miller said. “So while enrollment may fluctuate by a couple hundred students here or there, for the most part we know how many students we’re going to have and we can effectively fund them with financial aid. It’s not that big of a deal for financial aid.”</p>\n<p>According to Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop, the increasing number of applicants allows the university to select more academically adept students, leading to an increase in the value of a UCSB degree in the job and graduate school market.</p>\n<p>“The academic prestige of the campus will continue to rise high and you’ll see more high-achieving students in our classrooms,” Przekop said. “It means the value of your UCSB degree will continue to rise as you begin your career and/or apply to graduate programs.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said the only downside accompanying the increase in applicants is that the university will have to deny more students.</p>\n<p>“Competition for admission to UCSB will increase,” Przekop said. “Unfortunately, excellent applicants will be denied admission. It never feels good to deny access to wonderful applicants.”</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, the increase in applications can be attributed to the university’s growing public relations efforts, including an increased social media presence, a recently added virtual campus tour to the admissions website and the presence of more visits from California high schools and community colleges than in the previous year.</p>\n<p>“We have been more visible and active in our California outreach efforts,” Przekop said. “This fall we visited approximately 100 more schools in California than last year.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said the greater number of applicants can also be accredited to the university’s recognition worldwide, helped in part by recent Nobel Prize for Physics recipient Shuji Nakamura.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is recognized by top student scholars as a world-class university,” Przekop said. “We have a new Nobel Prize winner, which certainly drew global attention.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he attributes the record amount of applications to the university’s highly ranked education, prominent diversity, effective research and faculty.</p>\n<p>“This year’s record number of applications is a testament to UC Santa Barbara’s stature as a world leader in academic excellence and diversity, cutting-edge research and innovative teaching,” Yang said. “We are proud to be a campus of choice for talented and high-achieving students with diverse backgrounds who enrich our community.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, January 15,

written by Off-Campus Senators Christian Ornelas and Rafael Cornejo.</p>\n<p>The purpose of these Facebook accounts is to help increase senators’ accountability and transparency, the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Previously, students had a difficult time finding relevant information regarding Senate, the resolution added.</p>\n<p>“When we give updates, a lot of them will be on our personal social media accounts, which [may] not always be public or as accessible as we would like it to be,” Ornelas said during Wednesday night’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Senators are required to “continuously update these pages with their current office hours, project updates, and any other relevant information.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Ornelas said an added benefit of Facebook is that it allows users to visit a page without needing to have an account for themselves.</p>\n<p>“As long as they’re able to see that content then that’s super beneficial,” he said.</p>\n<p>There will also be a university announcement sent out to the student body to make them aware of the newly created Facebook accounts.</p>\n<p>These accounts must be created by the end of Week 2 of Winter Quarter 2019 and will be linked on the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate website by the end of the third week for both winter and spring quarters.</p>\n<p>Ornelas is responsible for making these updates to the website.</p>\n<p>The resolution also says senators should be making a larger effort to expand beyond their personal accounts to provide this information for the student body.</p>\n<p>Ornelas said he drew inspiration for the resolution from UC Berkeley and added that UCSB senator’s accounts would be modeled after those of Berkeley’s senators.</p>\n<p>The requirement of public Facebook pages will be later written into legal code with the senate’s approval, the resolution states.</p>\n<p><i>Aaron Berkness is a reporter at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85574\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-12/senate-takes-a-step-toward-transparency-with-public-facebook-accounts-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85574\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-12/senate-takes-a-step-toward-transparency-with-public-facebook-accounts-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-12/senate-takes-a-step-toward-transparency-with-public-facebook-accounts-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-12/senate-takes-a-step-toward-transparency-with-public-facebook-accounts-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-12/senate-takes-a-step-toward-transparency-with-public-facebook-accounts-resolution/","id":2942,"author":{"id":64,"name":"Aaron Berkness"},"related":[2941,2940,2939],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
