CSUB improves its record to 12-14 overall.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos seemed out of sync from behind the plate starting in the first inning, and were unable to score through the opening six innings against CSUB senior pitcher Spenser Messmore. Messmore threw 113 pitches in nine innings for the Roadrunners, giving up just six hits and improving on his .67 ERA, a statistic worthy of No. 3 in the nation for Division I baseball.</p>\n<p>“He has had a good year so far and he commanded the strike zone from the first inning on,” Wallace said. “His slider was really working for him.”</p>\n<p>The win improves Messmore’s season record to 3-1. Junior outfielder Frank Martinez led the way for CSUB on the offensive end with two RBI’s, two hits and one run.</p>\n<p>Contrary to Messmore’s solo pitching performance through nine innings, UCSB saw four of its pitchers take the mound throughout the course of the game. Starting pitcher Matt Vedo gave up four runs and three hits through just two innings on the mound while tallying four strike outs before being replaced by junior right-hander Jared Wilson.</p>\n<p>“Matt struggled throwing strikes,” Wallace said. “We gave him too many free base runners, which will always help [the other team], especially when we’re facing a guy who’s pounding the strike zone.”</p>\n<p>Wilson struck out one batter while giving up two hits and one run through four innings pitched. In the seventh and eighth innings, senior right-hander Jeremy Peterson gave up three runs and two hits before being substituted for sophomore left-hander Cameron Cuneo, who gave up no hits or runs in the ninth inning.</p>\n<p>“They hit a couple home runs which helped them later in the game,” Wallace said. “When they had a few hits here and there, they had runners to score.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos return to Big West Conference action tomorrow for a three-game series against visiting Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Josh Ortiz, County news Editor</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Log onto Facebook and you will probably see a newsfeed full of articles or videos on Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. We hear the constant drum of “Trump is a short-fingered xenophobe with an odd fixation on Skittles” or “Hillary is a lying crook but is actually dead and the woman behind the podium is actually a body double.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Believe me, I know the allure of this realm of election coverage; it can come off as ridiculous or groundbreaking or just straight-up entertaining. I am 98 percent sure that I’ve read at least one Trump-esque news article every day since the billionaire first announced his candidacy over a year ago.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Just for a moment, however, let’s take our eyes off the national election coverage and take a look at the election going on right here in our own backyard, an election that can most certainly affect our lives in a direct way.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Take, for example, the historic ballot measure to raise up a Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista this November. The I.V. CSD is a proposed form of local governance that will have the power to improve infrastructure and institute community policing should Measures E and F be approved by voters.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sure, a CSD has little to do with peace in the Middle East or ending Congressional gridlock. The question of approving the I.V. CSD, however, does affect whether students will be able to walk home on a well-lit street. At the same time, having a CSD also determines how much more money in taxes students pay on a monthly basis (as much as “half a Freebirds burrito every month,” according to community organizer Jonathan Abboud).</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Indeed, this local election really does have its own sense of thrill; it’s the consummation of nearly two years of reporting in I.V. on my end. In this other realm of election coverage we also see the work of an influential local political party — the Santa Barbara County Democrats.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">See, for example, the I.V. CSD board of director’s race. Just a few weeks ago, the local Democratic Party handed its endorsements to four candidates running for elected office in the proposed I.V. CSD — Spencer Brandt, Natalie Jordan, Ethan Bertrand and Father Jon-Stephen Hedges.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Prior to this endorsement, many of the candidates expressed the influence it would have in determining the outcome of the November election. The Democratic Party provides candidates with access to an unprecedented amount of resources: mail-in flyers, volunteer forces and cooperation with the campaigns of other local candidates and measures.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One other candidate, Andrew Gabriel Pragin, even said it would be a significant setback to not receive such an endorsement. He sought the endorsement, but was passed up by the local party officials. Now he fights what he called an “uphill battle” to get a foothold in this election, the struggle to receive the endorsement of other local political entities without the approval of the Democratic Party behind him.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Look also at the race to elect the Third District County Supervisor. The two candidates vying for the position this November are Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann. The two are far from being a Hillary-Trump dichotomy, but their competition for the seat is a determining factor in Isla Vista affairs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Without a CSD, the Santa Barbara County is the only governing entity (other than the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District) responsible for the college town, and the Third District County Supervisor serves as the sole representative of Isla Vista on the county board of supervisors.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">That being said, the Third District County Supervisor will be a large voice in the things that affect students in Isla Vista, such as the amount of policing in Isla Vista during Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This upcoming school year, I encourage you to follow the local election cycle. This is the election where we can see history unfold in Isla Vista and see the face of representation change in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My personal recommendation: check in with the <i>Nexus</i> on all your local election coverage as often as you check in with Facebook on all things Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, September 22, 2016, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/local-elections-may-profoundly-impact-i-v/","id":4508,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4507,4506,4505],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: The Goings On in I.V.

Organizers are also planning to host a “brainstorming session” next week about the community center which will take place the first weekend of October.</p>\n<p>There will be another meeting at 6 p.m. tonight in the I.V. Clinic building to discuss a proposed noise ordinance change for Isla Vista. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office proposed in August that the start of quiet hours be moved earlier from midnight to 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights. At the meeting, students and Isla Vista residents will be able to voice concerns to officers regarding matters such as enforcement of the ordinance.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) will host its annual Pardall Carnival on Saturday from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. The carnival will feature tables from many of the student groups and local organizations involved on campus and in Isla Vista. IVCRC will have a Ferris wheel on Pardall Road as well as live music from local bands. The Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank will provide free food for attendees.</p>\n<p>A local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Cafe). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. This dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Division of Student Affairs will be hosting an evening of spoken word by artist Sunni Patterson on Tuesday, Oct. 4, at the St. George Family Youth Center (889 Camino Del Sur). The performance is part of the “Resilient Love” series that “asks how we can respond ethically and honorably to hate and violence.”</p>\n<p>Sunni Patterson will perform for another evening of spoken word on Wednesday, Oct. 5, alongside David Kyuman Kim and George Lipsitz at the Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall. This event is again part of the “Resilient Love” series.</p>\n<p>Community volunteers are currently working to register 13,000 voters in Isla Vista and at UCSB. In years past, UCSB has been one of the top universities in terms of registering voters, registering as many as 11,000 voters. This year, volunteers hope to set a new record of 13,000 registered voters for the November election. The last day to register is Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>The next Isla Vista Community Network meeting will be held Thursday, Oct.13, at the I.V. Clinic building. The meeting will run from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., and lunch will be provided. Stakeholders involved in I.V. — heads of local nonprofit organizations, volunteers, long-term residents, students, county representatives and Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers — will update one another on the status of their respective groups as they relate to the community. I.V. Community Network meetings are regularly held on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p>The Nexus, KCSB and The Bottom Line will co-host a debate between Bruce Porter and Joan Hartmann, the candidates for Third District County Supervisor. The debate will be Thursday, Oct. 13 at I.V. Theater starting at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>Vive El Arte SB is hosting a “Free Concert for the Family” at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 21, at Isla Vista Elementary School (6875 El Colegio Rd.). Mexico-City-based traditional band Yolotecuani sones de Guerrero will be performing at the event.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, September 29, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/vista-point-the-goings-on-in-i-v-this-week/","id":4509,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4508,4507,4506],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Tame Matadors in Series Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A windy day provided UCSB’s bats with some added power during an 11-1 rout of Cal State Northridge yesterday at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.

After a scoreless third inning UCSB put two more runs on the scoreboard in the bottom of the fourth. A botched pickoff attempt by the Matadors allowed a UCSB runner to take home plate from third base.</p>\n<p>UCSB exploded for four runs in the fifth inning, increasing their lead to 9-0 after junior infielder Steven Moon sent a three-run triple into the outfield. Moon later scored in the same inning after the CSUN pitcher sent an errant throw past his catcher. Northridge gave up an RBI single to senior Lance Roenicke, who sent sophomore infielder Brandon Trinkwon through home plate.</p>\n<p>The Matadors finally were able to send across across a run during the top of the eighth inning when freshman Chester Pak sent a runner through home plate. It was the only run CSUN would score in the game.</p>\n<p>Gaucho Head Coach Andrew Checketts, who doubles as the team’s pitching coach, saw great performance from his pitchers on Thursday. Freshman lefthander Andrew Vasquez started the game and was credited with the win, giving up three hits and zero runs through the first three innings. Vasquez struck out seven batters in total and currently holds a team-best 1.10 ERA on the season.</p>\n<p>Stepping in to the relief position on Thursday was UCSB freshman righthander Dalton Douty. Douty gave up one run and three hits while striking out one batter through the final three innings of the game.</p>\n<p>The Matadors gave up six errors overall, while the UCSB defense was able to control the field without making any errors through the nine innings of play. Four Gaucho players added two hits to the box score for UCSB, including Moon, Trinkwon, Roenicke and Mahle.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its homestand against the Matadors through the weekend with a game today and tomorrow at Caesar Uyesaka stadium. Though still early in the season, Big West standings currently rank UCSB at tied for No. 2 with Cal State Fullerton.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45923\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-06/gauchos-tame-matadors-series-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45923\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-06/gauchos-tame-matadors-series-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-06/gauchos-tame-matadors-series-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-06/gauchos-tame-matadors-series-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-06/gauchos-tame-matadors-series-opener/","id":4510,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[4509,4508,4507],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
