I.V. residents showed support by honking car horns, cheering on protesters and by joining the protest.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major and event attendee Kevin Villar said he relates to the evicted families because of his personal experience with a similar situation that occurred in his hometown.</p>\n<p>“This situation has a huge impact on me because my family and I got evicted during my childhood at apartments that we used to live at,” Villar said. “It makes me angry to see the reality that most landlords in I.V. only care about profit.”</p>\n<p>Villar also said the evictions may have been particularly “traumatic” for children of the evicted families who may have thereafter been exposed to inappropriate aspects of I.V. culture.</p>\n<p>“Just think of the kids and the traumatic experiences of not having a home. They deal with that fact that there will always be drunken students on the street and see drugs weekly,” Villar said. “Yet they still get evicted, which is injustice.”</p>\n<p>Former I.V. resident Maria Hernandez, who was among those evicted from the Abrego Villas, said her family prefers to live in I.V. and that the eviction has been particularly difficult because she is a single mother who provides for other family members.</p>\n<p>“It affected us so much. I live in Goleta but I would rather live in Isla Vista much more because my family prefers to be here,” Hernandez said. “I believe it is an injustice, especially because I am a single mother who supports my children and grandchildren.”</p>\n<p>Another evicted tenant from the Abrego Villas, Valentina Hernandez, said she believes it was racist of the landlord to evict her and her family.</p>\n<p>“It is discrimination because they initially said they were not going to kick us out,” Valentina Hernandez said. “I believe it is a racist act because they still do not have anyone living there, not even new students who can afford it. They said that they would reconstruct the building and slowly let us back into homes.”</p>\n<p>Valentina Hernandez said she has been living in different hotels and homes since she was evicted and said she feels like she has not been told the entire truth regarding her eviction situation by her landlord or the property management company.</p>\n<p>“I have been living in several motels since then. My daughter’s a school teacher and has also felt bad for us and housed us as well. I feel like a refugee,” Valentina Hernandez said. “I think this type of thing happens every now and then but I feel lied to and discriminated against.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60381\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60381\" data-attachment-id=\"60381\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/protesters-march-through-isla-vista-in-objection-of-evictions/ivtu-march_kenneth-song-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422629444\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"26\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60381\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C266\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-9.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60381\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Freebirds employee and I.V. resident for the past 13 years Briselda Martinez said she still does not have a permanent home and now lives in a place without a bathroom.</p>\n<p>“They did so much damage to us,” Martinez said. “I do not have a stable home still. They only gave us 60 days in the summer to find a new house. Now, I pay $750 for a really cramped up room with no bathroom whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>Martinez also said being homeless is not an option because she has family in Mexico that relies on her for financial support.</p>\n<p>“I am going to withstand everything because I cannot live in the streets,” Martinez said. “I definitely cannot go back to Mexico because there are no jobs there. I send money to my sons in Mexico and it is difficult.”</p>\n<p>Three-year resident of I.V. Jacinto Rodriguez said he joined the protest because he believes the evictions were an act of discrimination for the sake of profit.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it is racist and very wrong,” Rodriguez said, “We have nowhere else to live and it is not the same.”</p>\n<p>Rodriguez also said the evicted tenants do not deserve to be booted from their homes when they have insurance and good credit records.</p>\n<p>“This is an effort between everyone because they do not want to see my people evicted from Isla Vista. It is essential to have a roof over your head,” Rodriguez said. “In my case, they have checked my record, insurance and credit which is good and important, but they still evicted me.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60383\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60383\" data-attachment-id=\"60383\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-02/protesters-march-through-isla-vista-in-objection-of-evictions/ivtu-march_kenneth-song-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422630968\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60383\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C266\" alt=\"IVTU March_Kenneth Song-11\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March_Kenneth-Song-11.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alumnus and former I.V. resident Sharlene Macharia said it is vital that demonstrations bring attention to the eviction situation so that students and I.V. residents can collectively take action so those IVTU alleges were wronged can see justice, as well as to prevent similar instances from happening in the future.</p>\n<p>“I am glad that people are protesting and marching.

homes is just wrong, no matter what management or company it is,” Macharia said. “The landlords only care about the money and are not even from Isla Vista so they cannot relate to life here.”</p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Associated Students Pardall Center will play host to a variety of events this week as part of the first-ever Isla Vista Week, hosted by the Associated Students Isla Vista Community Relations Committee. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) will host its first-ever Isla Vista Week from Monday through Friday to educate students and community members about I.V.’s history and issues involving I.V. environment, housing, community and more.</p>\n<p>The event series will begin Monday afternoon with an on-foot tour of I.V. led by IVCRC and will end Friday night with I.V. First Friday, an entertainment event typically held on the first Friday of each month of the academic year. Other events include an environment and sustainability presentation by A.S. Recycling on Tuesday, a family craft and community art project on Wednesday and a student housing forum hosted by the Isla Vista Housing Coalition on Thursday.</p>\n<p>IVCRC external chair and fourth-year political science major Daniela Bayon said the events are aimed at building a community that cares about prominent issues currently surrounding I.V.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to bring students, families and community members together through a variety of different relationships, events, and programs,” Bayon said.</p>\n<p>According to Bayon, IVCRC wants to expand their community involvement beyond their annual Pardall Carnival and Chilla Vista events, which are held annually in Fall and Spring quarters respectively.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I do believe there is a housing crisis in Isla Vista. I was one of the many students who had to couch surf this past fall, and unfortunately, this is not new to Isla Vista. It has been going on for many years where students are desperate for housing, families get evicted, and rent prices skyrocket. – Alejandra Melgoza, Isla Vista Housing Coalition organizer and second-year Chicana/o studies and history of public policy major</p></blockquote>\n<p>“It became our goal as a committee to do more, and to really focus on issue-based activism,” Bayon said. “It’s really come out of this concept to bring awareness to issues in Isla Vista and address them with community members who are already working on things.”</p>\n<p>Bayon said the housing forum is the start of IVCRC’s plan to eventually create a press release to be presented to university administration with a list of demands concerning what organizers call the current housing crisis in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We want to hear from the average student at UCSB that struggles with housing,” Bayon said. “A lot of the advisers on the Chancellor’s Housing Committee don’t grasp the idea that there is a housing crisis, so our goal is to raise awareness through this forum and the stories of some of these students to UCSB administration.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, Isla Vista Housing Coalition organizer and a second-year Chicana/o studies and history of public policy major, said the alleged housing crisis in I.V. is a prevalent issue facing all students living off-campus.</p>\n<p>“I do believe there is a housing crisis in Isla Vista,” Melgoza said in an email. “I was one of the many students who had to couch surf this past fall, and unfortunately, this is not new to Isla Vista. It has been going on for many years where students are desperate for housing, families get evicted, and rent prices skyrocket.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she hopes the Thursday forum at the Pardall Center will allow students to share their personal experiences with housing in I.V. and prompt collective action toward addressing housing issues.</p>\n<p>“It will be an open dialogue in which any issues may be brought up,” Melgoza said in an email. “I hope that with our collected efforts we can find a solution to give students and families affordable housing, knowledge on their rights as tenants, and put a stop to evictions.”</p>\n<p>Second-year English major Julia Swensen, who will be attending I.V.

IVTU held a meeting earlier this week, seen here, about the situation. <i>Daily Nexus File Photo</i></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) will lead a march from the Pardall Center through I.V. Friday at 1 p.m. to protest the eviction of six households from their apartments at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The march is part of IVTU’s three-day “Tenants Re-Claiming Isla Vista” <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/ivtu-holds-campaign-for-evicted-i-v-residents/\">campaign</a> created to amass support for evicted tenants at the Abrego Villas whose renovated units underwent an alleged 50 percent rent increase. The campaign aims to urge Majestic Asset Management, LLC, the management company working for Abrego Villas’ property owners, to pay the tenants’ relocation benefits, required under Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444.</p>\n<p>IVTU president and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov said the march has been organized to promote justice for the evicted tenants at the Abrego Villas and to inspire further legislative action to prevent future unjustified evictions in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are requesting that Majestic Asset Management pay the tenants the relocation benefits that they rightly deserve but have not yet received,” Bogdanov said. “We would like to show to the legislatures on the county and statewide levels that Isla Vista is in need of legislative reforms and improvements to strengthen tenant variety as well as to improve the housing situation in I.V.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are not talking about statistics here, we are talking about lives of real people who are being denied fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities. – IVTU president and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bogdanov said the march is also intended to educate and unite all tenants renting spaces in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Lack of knowledge on the part of the tenants about their rights in housing issues is a big problem in Isla Vista and … affects all members of the community,” Bogdanov said. “The only way we can create a real difference is by becoming more educated and uniting to demand better housing.”</p>\n<p>California Assemblymember for Santa Barbara Das Williams said he supports the IVTU’s campaign and that without their action there would be little knowledge of the issue in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think that if they weren’t doing something that we might not even know about it,” Williams said. “I hope they will continue to engage the owners in a respectful and civil manner as something that might actually provide some benefits for the families that were involved.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said this is not a one-time issue but rather the latest in a series of evictions of low-income residents, primarily Latino families, in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to rally the community support and raise awareness about the fact that these housing issues are recurring, and ongoing” Bogdanov said. “We are not talking about statistics here, we are talking about lives of real people who are being denied fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities.”</p>\n<p>President of Majestic Asset Management, LLC Brian Lezak said the property owner of Abrego Villas is responsible for the evictions that violated Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444, not Majestic Asset Management, LLC.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the Isla Vista Tenants Union and support them in their desire to defend the claims of those tenants in Isla Vista whose situation is in direct violation of this ordinance,” Lezak said. “In the meantime, we are hopeful that any future activities taken by the Isla Vista Tenants Union are done in a peaceful and safe manner.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will defend our position in court which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts. – President of Majestic Asset Management, LLC Brian Lezak</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lezak, Majestic Asset Management, LLC plans to present an argument in defense of the company in court.</p>\n<p>“We intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak said, “We will defend our position in court which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he believes Majestic Asset Management, LLC should pay the tenants the relocation benefits he thinks they deserve.</p>\n<p>“In my mind either they should comply because they are required to do so, or because it is the right thing to do. Either way it was the intent of the county ordinance to cover situations like this,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams said evictions such as these can be a result of maximization of rent returns by all I.V. landlords, which can create discrimination problems in I.V. against low-income residents.</p>\n<p>“The diversity of having families a part of Isla Vista is something that can mitigate some of the public safety concerns,” Williams said. “The most interesting, the most safe, and the most thriving neighborhoods are ones that have demographic diversity, and one of the challenges we have in Isla Vista is increasing demographic concentration.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to IVFP officials, deputies began notifying I.V. residents and property managers in November to make residents aware of the rule change come Feb. 15. The purpose of the new citations, according to the policy, will be to increase pedestrian visibility on the sidewalks and therefore increase their safety by keeping them out of the street.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino, the high population density in I.V. causes residents to park illegally on sidewalks to make room for more cars.</p>\n<p>“Rising costs make people want more roommates, which means more cars,” Plastino said. “They’re trying to slam more cars into a driveway that wasn’t designed that way.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s the lack of space on the sidewalks when there are parties. If the streets get crowded when students come out to party, how can they think about moving them all onto a sidewalk? – First-year sociology major John Michael Joseph</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a statement from IVFP, the practice of parking on the sidewalk forces pedestrians out into the street and into the path of oncoming traffic. Citations will also be issued to allow pedestrians with physical limitations safe use of the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Third-year biochemistry major Sam Perez said he has not ever seen law enforcement officers try to keep people out of the streets in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen I.V. Foot Patrol, or any law enforcement for that matter, make an effort to keep students out of the street here,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said the law wasn’t enforced in the past because I.V. lacked a complete sidewalk network.</p>\n<p>“You go over to Goleta and you’re not going to see a whole bunch of people just standing in the middle of the road, because they have sidewalks there,” Plastino said. “So the thought was: If you’re a pedestrian and you’re walking down DP, you need to be on the sidewalk; you can’t be in the roadway.”</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major John Michael Joseph said the enforcement does not make sense because parties tend to keep people off sidewalks.</p>\n<p>“It’s the lack of space on the sidewalks when there are parties,” Joseph said, “If the streets get crowded when students come out to party, how can they think about moving them all onto a sidewalk?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If people want to walk on the sidewalk or stand on the sidewalk, they’re free to do that, but the roadway needs to remain clear. – IVFP Lieutenant Rob Plastino</p></blockquote>\n<p>Plastino said California law states that cars cannot park in a way that blocks sidewalks and that now that DP has a sidewalk running its full length, IVFP can enforce the law correctly.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that people start realizing that the sidewalks are there now, and sidewalks can be utilized for pedestrian use,” Plastino said. “If people want to walk on the sidewalk or stand on the sidewalk, they’re free to do that, but the roadway needs to remain clear.”</p>\n<p>First-year biopsychology major Adam Chukhman said it would be hard to keep everyone off the street even with the new restrictions because people simply don’t want to walk on the sidewalks.</p>\n<p>“The reason people walk on the street isn’t the lack of good sidewalks,” Chukhman said, “it’s the lack of want to walk on the sidewalk.”</p>\n<p>First-year chemical engineering major, John Stair said the he does not think citations would keep people from walking in the street.</p>\n<p>“It’s clear that they want people to stay off the street and stay on the sidewalk, but that’s just never going to happen,” Stair said.</p>\n<p>According to a statement from IVFP, I.V. will need more funding to be able to complete sidewalk installation along El Nido, Trigo, Seville and Madrid roads, as well as the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60160\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/ivfp-to-begin-citing-cars-on-sidewalks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60160\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/ivfp-to-begin-citing-cars-on-sidewalks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/ivfp-to-begin-citing-cars-on-sidewalks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/ivfp-to-begin-citing-cars-on-sidewalks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-26/ivfp-to-begin-citing-cars-on-sidewalks/","id":4783,"author":{"id":34,"name":"Patrick Guardian"},"related":[4782,4781,4780],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
