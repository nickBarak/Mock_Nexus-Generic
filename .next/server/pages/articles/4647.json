Less than 30 officers are expected to patrol on Sunday and Monday, he said.</p>\n<p>UCPD will be sourcing officers from seven different University of California campuses to supplement its staff. Officers from Los Angeles, Irvine, UC San Diego, San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Riverside will arrive at UCSB on Oct. 27 to attend a one-day training prior to Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>Nearly 100 UCPD officers were present in I.V. last year, Signa said, but this year “there’s a better understanding within the whole community, this idea of trying to keep it safe, keep it local.” He said initiatives like UC Isla Vista Volunteering Program have been “fantastic” at drawing students away from parties and toward local events.</p>\n<p>Although the department hopes to gradually decrease police presence by higher increments, “we’re always kind of nervous about what’s going to happen,” Signa said. UCPD can call on the Santa Barbara Police Department and additional UC officers in the case of an emergency.</p>\n<p>IVFP, an offshoot of the Santa Barbara County Police Department, plans to post approximately 100 officers in I.V. on Friday and Saturday, 50 officers on Sunday and 75 on Monday, according to IVFP Sergeant Chris Gotschall.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73145\" style=\"width: 466px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73145\" data-attachment-id=\"73145\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/policestats/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=357%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"357,181\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"policestats\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=250%2C127&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?fit=357%2C181&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73145\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?resize=456%2C200\" alt=\"Icon courtesy of Symbolon; Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus\" width=\"456\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=456%2C200 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PoliceStats.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=456%2C200 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73145\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Icon courtesy of Symbolon, Noun Project; Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The department came to the decision after coordinating with both UCPD and UCSB administration. “Based on how much quieter Halloween was last year, they determined that they could actually decrease their coverage.” Gotschall said.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping that this is a good sign; that things are more manageable in Isla Vista and on campus and the need for the presence of police officers is less,” Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said.</p>\n<p>IVFP officers arrested less than 30 people during Halloween weekend last year, down from over 100 in years prior, and crime is expected to stay low this year. The department currently has no plans to bring horses into I.V. as mounted patrol units, but Gotschall said this could change in case of an emergency.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want unsafe parties, we don’t want people coming in from all over to cause mischief,” he said.</p>\n<p>Because Halloween falls on a Monday this year, less activity is expected on Halloween Day. Gotschall said approximately 188 officers were patrolling I.V. on both weekend days in 2011, the last time Halloween was on a Monday.</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, external vice president of local affairs, plans to continue alternative programming from last year. Businesses in the Downtown District participating in “Haunt the Loop” will share candy with trick-or-treaters, and volunteers will pass out water bottles to partygoers at “hydration stations” throughout Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board hosted Snoop Dogg for a sold-out concert on Halloween last year, and this year’s headliner will be announced in the three weeks leading up to Oct. 31.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73144\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73144\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/","id":4647,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[4646,4645,4644],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Students, Community Members Unite At Vigil For Andres Esteban Sanchez","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A crowd of over 100 people met outside the Associated Students Pardall Center Thursday night to honor UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez who passed away the morning of Sunday, Oct. 11.

He would have said, ‘Eddie, just finish the quarter, and then do what you’re going to do, but get through it.’”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65476\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"969475541\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65481\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65476\" data-attachment-id=\"65476\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/students-community-members-unite-at-vigil-for-andres-esteban-sanchez/sanchez_stephen-manga-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444894707\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"6400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sanchez_Stephen Manga-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65476\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65476\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahta, who was Sanchez’s roommate this year, said he has been unable to adjust to Sanchez’s absence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I woke up every day and I would see his face, just sleeping right there. Every day,” Bahta said. “Still, it’s weird to think I won’t see him just sitting on the couch or walking into the house because it just passes my mind that he’s gone. It doesn’t click; it hasn’t clicked yet.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nixon, Sanchez would have wanted his friends to focus on moving forward after enduring their loss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is sad that he has passed away, but he would want us to remember him as the wonderful, bright person that he was and not let this hold you down,” Nixon said. “Just remember who he was … don’t stop in your tracks, just keep moving because it’s gonna be ok.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year political science major Carissa Garcia said Sanchez had a passion for soccer and played center forward for the UCSB club soccer team as well as on national teams in Mexico.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw him Saturday and Sunday … We were watching the Mexico game and he was so happy because Mexico won,” Garcia said. “I remember some of his last words as he walked out the door… he walks out the door and he says, “I’m gonna go pro one day.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garcia also said Sanchez was a fan of the bands Pink Floyd and Sublime and enjoyed watching “Breaking Bad” and “South Park.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He had a really chill vibe. He was a FIFA king, beer pong king, too,” Garcia said. “Nobody can beat him at beer pong.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year UCSB student Rosalea LeBlanc, who lived on Sanchez’s floor in Santa Catalina last year, said she remembers staying up late with him talking about “The Beatles and conspiracy theories.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just remember how excited he got just when I would add my input. He makes you feel like you’re a valid person, and he really appreciated everything you would say. He took you seriously,” LeBlanc said. “That really says a lot about what kind of person he was. He made everyone feel special.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara City College student Marvin Ramirez said he spoke to Sanchez’s mother who described her son as enthusiastic and caring.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She wanted to let you know that her son was someone who was very intelligent, someone who was really hardworking and someone that was always very loving,” Ramirez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator and third-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza said although she did not know Sanchez personally, she admires his accomplishments. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65477\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2107801270\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65481\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65477\" data-attachment-id=\"65477\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/students-community-members-unite-at-vigil-for-andres-esteban-sanchez/sanchez_stephen-manga-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444895527\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"57\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sanchez_Stephen Manga-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65477\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-3-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65477\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just being a human being who was in need of help and attention and love and compassion, that enabled us to find strength to be able to honor his memory as a scholar, as a young man who made it to this university when, as people of color, it’s so hard to get here,” Melgoza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahta said he will remember Sanchez’s life by celebrating his achievements and positive character.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I loved Andy, I always will,” Bahta said. “But I’m not going to go on with life having this chip on my shoulder and crying about it every day.

Other activities throughout the event included a butterfly exhibit, a bounce house and a soccer game with police. Various businesses throughout I.V. offered flyer coupons to Meet Your Neighbors Day attendees.</p>\n<p>The new community center on Embarcadero del Mar opened Oct. 17, serving as an art exhibition for the day. The center displayed photographs, paintings and sculptures as well as a stage for an open mic session, a zumba class and yoga.</p>\n<p>Curator for the art exhibition and third-year art major Robert Perez said opening the Community Center on Meet Your Neighbors Day was beneficial for both events to attract a large crowd.</p>\n<p>“We want to attract as many people as possible to every event,” Perez said. “There’s so much going on today, there’s stages out in Anisq’Oyo’ Park and everywhere, so we thought it made sense to unify everything under Meet Your Neighbor Day.”</p>\n<p>Graduate student Aaron Howard said he showcased seven of his photographs of I.V. in the day-long art gallery at the community center.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think it’s a good way to bring people together and expose people’s work,” Howard said.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Taylor Nguyen said she appreciates the art exhibited being part of Meet Your Neighbors Day.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to see the artistic side of the community. I think that is something that is not always highlighted at events, but to see student artwork has been really impressive,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>Second-year mathematics major Gabriel Pragin said he helped organize Meet Your Neighbors Day and the community center launch. According to Pragin, it is very rewarding to see the event come together and I.V. residents enjoying themselves in the parks.</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to get us all to work together and be friends and meet each other in parks and have a good time listening to music, looking at art,” Pragin said. “It’s a way to get together and just be a community and support each other and have fun together.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumna and intern with the Christian organization Real Life Samantha Urena said Meet Your Neighbors Day is a good opportunity to develop stronger relationships within the community.</p>\n<p>“[Meet Your Neighbors Day] create[s] more of a community of respect and compassion and bonding over having some fun on a Saturday afternoon, not just getting drunk and making more acquaintances, but actually becoming friends with some people,” Urena said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy major Philip Griffin said he enjoyed listening to music and being outdoors during the all-day event.</p>\n<p>“[Meet Your Neighbors Day] is a really important event,” Griffin said. “It’s such a small town and we’re all so close it would be nice to have some more events that really unify everyone and create an overall sense of unity and friendship and trust.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

The fee will be used to partially fund a Community Services District (CSD) in Isla Vista to improve infrastructure, provide tenant-landlord mediation and institute community policing, among other services.</p>\n<p>According to Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3), the legislation outlining the Isla Vista CSD, the Santa Barbara Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) sets the rate at which the CSD may levy its UUT. LAFCO approved an eighth percent UUT in April.</p>\n<p>Along with several other I.V. stakeholders, Chuck Eckert, an Isla Vista property provider, assembled Isla Vistans Against Higher Taxes in September to build opposition toward the measure to approve the UUT, which requires a two-thirds majority to pass.</p>\n<p>One of Eckert’s main objections to the measure, he said, is its potential to increase the cost of living for I.V. renters. Not only will renters have to pay the taxes for their own utilities, he said, but any tax paid by landlords will be added to renting costs.</p>\n<p>Eckert said he and many other I.V. property providers oppose higher rent because such price hikes will make their units less “attractive,” prompting renters to look elsewhere for housing.</p>\n<p>In a radio show with KCSB 91.9 FM in August, Yes on E&amp;F campaign organizer Jonathan Abboud said each person will pay between $5 to $10 per month for the UUT — “about half a Freebirds burrito once a month.”</p>\n<p>Although unable to provide numbers during an interview with the Nexus, Eckert said he anticipates much higher costs as a result of a UUT.</p>\n<p>“It’s certainly going to be more than half a burrito,” he said.</p>\n<p>Eckert said the CSD will be ineffective in providing services to Isla Vista residents. Half of the funds raised by the tax will fund “bureaucracy,” he said.</p>\n<p>Citing a financial feasibility study organized by The Fund for Santa Barbara in Sept. 2015, Eckert said there will be an annual $512,000 revenue from the UUT. About half of that amount, $257,000, will go toward management and administration of the CSD, leaving $255,000 for other services.</p>\n<p>This, however, is not the only proposed means of funding CSD services. UC Santa Barbara has pledged an annual $200,000 to the CSD for seven years.</p>\n<p>Eckert also disapproves of Measure F because he finds it to be unfair; UCSB can have representation in the CSD board of directors despite not paying the UUT. According to AB 3, UCSB shall appoint one member to the CSD board of directors, yet, as the financial feasibility study reports, all utility consumption on UCSB land would be exempt from a new UUT.</p>\n<p>Despite starting a campaign against Measure F, Eckert has not come out in opposition to Measure E, the ballot measure to create the CSD in Isla Vista. As he put it, “one could be neutral on Measure E and still oppose Measure F.”</p>\n<p>But according to Darcel Elliott, the campaign manager for Yes on E&amp;F, opposition to Measure F is still opposition to Measure E. Disapproving of the means to fund the CSD, she said, will not allow the CSD to provide all of its enumerated functions.</p>\n<p>“You can’t have E without F,” she said.</p>\n<p>One might say that the fate of the CSD ultimately rests on the approval of a UUT at some point. AB 3 enumerates that, if voters do not approve the UUT before Jan. 1, 2023, the CSD shall be dissolved as of that date.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73143\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/isla-vista-landlords-oppose-measure-f/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73143\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/isla-vista-landlords-oppose-measure-f/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/isla-vista-landlords-oppose-measure-f/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/isla-vista-landlords-oppose-measure-f/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/isla-vista-landlords-oppose-measure-f/","id":4646,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4645,4644,4643],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
