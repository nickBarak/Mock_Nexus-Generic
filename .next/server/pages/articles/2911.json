I understand we are a beach college but a lot of Greeks are the most intimidated by the LGBTQ community.”</p>\n<p>Escobar-Henry said publicly admitting your sexual orientation as gay can lead to negativity from those who oppose the gay community.</p>\n<p>“I feel that ‘coming out’ is definitely a gateway to have hatred towards you,” Escobar-Henry said. “The hatred comes from ignorance and making jokes out of LGBTQ people in the media and public.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English and film &amp; media studies major Chloe Babauta also spoke on the panel and said because of her bisexual identity she has been followed and verbally assaulted in I.V.</p>\n<p>“One time, I was walking down the street in Isla Vista with a girl,” Babauta said. “I was holding her hand and was followed. Another time, I was with my lesbian friends and men tried to make me make-out with them. I felt threatened and in danger. This is why I do not party in Isla Vista anymore.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

According to Harris, the $8,304 funding the BSU received is going toward covering the two-day program and informational documents for parents and students on campus. Harris said the outreach program is the only program that prioritizes African American students.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60678\" style=\"width: 344px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60678\" data-attachment-id=\"60678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-10/finance-and-business-committee-hears-from-groups/finance-board-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=5472%2C3648&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5472,3648\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1423457519\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60678\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Finance-Board-3-1024x683.jpg?resize=334%2C222\" alt=\"Committee members hear students' proposals for funding.

Photographs published in his earlier book<em> Juvenile in Justice</em> have been on exhibit nationwide and used as a tool for advocates for juvenile justice system reform. Images from his new book are currently on display on the first floor of the library.</p>\n<p>Ross, who previously worked as a photographer for <em>Time Magazine</em>, <em>Newsweek</em> and the<em> New York Times</em>, said he wants his exhibits and books to spark change in the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p>“I’m not a judge; I’m not a probation officer. I’m an artist; I’m a human being,” Ross said. “I decided with my work I’m going to use art as a weapon.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kids can’t sue anybody. They have no rights. So it’s really easy to bully kids. – Art professor and photographer Richard Ross</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Ross, one of the underlying issues within the juvenile justice system is that “as a society, we bully kids.”</p>\n<p>“If you bully someone who is a person of color, you might get some pushback, you might be sued,” Ross said. “Kids can’t sue anybody. They have no rights. So it’s really easy to bully kids.”</p>\n<p>Ross said while there have been improvements made in the system since the publication of <em>Juvenile in Justice</em> three years ago, the situation for incarcerated girls has worsened.</p>\n<p>“The population of girls increases in relation to boys and girls have unique problems,” Ross said. “That’s why I published the book on girls to focus exactly on what’s going on with them.”</p>\n<p>Ross shared dozens of examples of his images, including one comparison between a detention cell in El Paso, Texas to one at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>“This holds the worst terrorist in the world. This holds a ten-year-old,” Ross said. “What’s the difference between the two? Who has the window? The terrorist, not the kid. I start presenting images like this to state and federal authorities . . . I start creating a bit of a buzz.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60470\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60470\" data-attachment-id=\"60470\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/art-professor-shares-images-of-jailed-youth/richard-ross_kenneth-song-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422984185\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Ross\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60470\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=335%2C223\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"335\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Ross said the plan to eliminate the use of solitary confinement at the Rikers Island complex, an institution he described as “nefarious,” is a move in the right direction, but that he will believe in substantial change “when he sees it.”</p>\n<p>“For four years I’ve been trying to get into Rikers and I’ve been told by the head of detention . . . by [Mayor] Bloomberg, by [Mayor] De Blasio, by judges, ‘You’ll never get into Rikers in this lifetime,’” Ross said. “New York State and North Carolina are the two states that default and have kids automatically tried or looked at as adults. It’s a terrible system and I hope Rikers gets better.”</p>\n<p>According to Ross, while solitary confinement is an issue of national importance, it also pervades the local justice system in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The state is supposed to act as the parent when the parent can’t,” Ross said. “But these are the closets that we put kids in. They’re under the guise of administrative segregation, time-out rooms and desensitization rooms. In Santa Barbara, I interviewed a kid that was in there for three weeks.”</p>\n<p>Ross said while visiting a detention center in Monterey Park, Calif., he came to understand that the large percentage of incarcerated youths are victims of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>“I asked the director what percentage of girls had been sexually abused when they come here,” Ross said. “He said ‘What percentage? Every one of them. All 88 girls in our custody have been sexually abused’ and then he said ‘and most of the boys.’ They’re all victims of abuse.”</p>\n<p>Jessica Sparks, an assistant with the Davidson Library Outreach Department and a third-year English and Renaissance studies major, said she was shocked by the sheer number of incarcerated youth that Ross’s project has revealed have been abused.</p>\n<p>“I thought it wasn’t that many, but hearing it was all of them it brings a whole new level of depth to the pictures downstairs,” Sparks said.</p>\n<p>According to Ross, many children in the juvenile justice system are suffering the consequences of their parents’ poor decisions.</p>\n<p>“A girl that was doing 35 years — she murdered somebody,” Ross said. “She was high on meth. Her mother gave her meth when she was seven. This girl has already served about ten years . . . she was sentenced at 14 and is going to serve until she’s 34.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Both my kids, and myself, avoided these kids’ situations because we had families that cared about us. We had resources from our family, from our community. These are kids that have none of that. There’s so many people that live paycheck to paycheck that are one step away from disaster and these kids are the result. – Richard Ross</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ross said one director of a detention center shared with him the difficulty of protecting transgender youth within the system.</p>\n<p>“Often they are thrown out of their family and have to respond with survival — sex to eat, to sleep, to live,” Ross said. “The director said [of a male to female transgender youth] ‘If I put her in with the girls, she’ll be hurt. If I put her in with the boys, she’ll be killed. I keep her in isolation, I know it’s against federal law . . . But she is not going to be killed on my watch.’”</p>\n<p>According to Ross, African American and Latino youths are at a higher risk of being tried as adults.</p>\n<p>“Latino youth are four time more likely to receive an adult sentence for the same crime as white children,” Ross said. “African American youth are nine times more likely.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and communication double major Alexis Lin, who took an art class with Ross last Spring quarter, said it is a glaring issue that the majority of the incarcerated are of color.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of youth get stereotyped into certain categories and that’s something that needs to be acknowledged,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>Ross said he often thought of the difference between his own children’s upbringing and that of incarcerated youth while visiting detention centers.</p>\n<p>“Both my kids, and myself, avoided these kids’ situations because we had families that cared about us. We had resources from our family, from our community,” Ross said. “These are kids that have none of that. There’s so many people that live paycheck to paycheck that are one step away from disaster and these kids are the result.”</p>\n<p>First-year English major Hector Sanchez Castaneda said he also thought of his family when he learned about the living conditions of incarcerated youth in America.</p>\n<p>“When I saw the pictures downstairs, on the first floor of the library, when I saw the little girl — she’s my sister’s age, eight-years-old,” Sanchez-Castaneda said. “It broke my heart to see a little girl like that with no family whatsoever to support her.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60469\" style=\"width: 280px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60469\" data-attachment-id=\"60469\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/art-professor-shares-images-of-jailed-youth/richard-ross_kenneth-song/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=1065%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1065,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422984014\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"170\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Ross\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60469\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song-682x1024.jpg?resize=270%2C405\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"270\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Richard-Ross_Kenneth-Song.jpg?w=1065&amp;ssl=1 1065w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60469\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art professor and photographer Richard Ross. <i>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>According to Ross, communities are better off when detention centers are closed and resources are invested elsewhere in the community.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been closing down a lot of these mass incarceration institutes, especially for kids,” Ross said. “We’ve turned a corner and crime hasn’t gone up . . . the data proves that the more you release kids and give resources to the community, the better the outcomes for kids and communities remain safe.”</p>\n<p>Ross said there are still significant changes that need to be made in the juvenile justice system and hopes his photos will play a part in communicating the need for reform.</p>\n<p>“What’s the common visual vocabulary: that if somebody sees a picture, you think about it,” Ross said. “I want to create that.

Currently around 50 percent of students waive Gaucho health insurance,” said Lau. “However they don’t account for the fact that currently, to be a student at UCSB you are required to have health insurance.”</p>\n<p>According to Lau, the Student Health Board’s new plan will financially hurt students, many of whom struggle to pay for tuition and school expenses already.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t really make sense to reduce financial aid for not having Gaucho Health Insurance when you’re making every student have it,” Lau said, “Essentially that means that they’re penalizing students for not using the Gaucho Health Insurance brand by reducing their financial aid package.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting Senator Zach Goulhiane of the UCen Governance Board reported that changes are being made to the campus mail system so that first-year students living in the Santa Catalina dorms will have to collect their mail at the UCen post office.</p>\n<p>“They’re planning on spending $93,000 to re-do pretty much all the P.O. boxes for the freshmen so all the FT mailboxes, all the University-owned mailboxes will be moved here [the UCen],” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>According to Goulhaine, the move is directed to increase foot traffic around UCen businesses and to simplify mail distribution.</p>\n<p>“They’re trying to get more traffic into the UCen so that more people will go around the bookstore and whatnot buying stuff here,” Goulhiane said, “And that way they centralize all the mail because now apparently it takes them a while to send it out.”</p>\n<p>Also during meeting, A.S. Recycling Program member Sam Breyfogle outlined the organization’s proposal to update recycling bin signs to reflect a new comingled recycling program that aims to provide specific instructions for waste management. The proposal is seeking funds from The Green Initiative Fund, a student-supported fund that funds eco-friendly projects on campus.</p>\n<p>“They [bins] were installed about 20 years ago. They currently say ‘newspapers, aluminum, plastic,’ and ‘glass’ as well as ‘trash,’” Breyfogle said. “We’d like to get signs that say ‘comingled recycling’ and underneath that a sign that lists out what can be recycled.”</p>\n<p>Breyfogle also said the organization wants to upgrade the BigBelly trashcans on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’d like to buy new bins for the interiors of the berthas,” Breyfogle said, “Many of the bins have holes bit through by rodents causing them to leak and make a complete mess of the interior.”</p>\n<p>After further discussion surrounding Gaucho Health Insurance, the Senate heard from A.S. Controller Amir Khazaieli about updates surrounding the iClicker rental program.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli explained that the goal is to make iClickers free for students to rent, but there will be a suggested $5 donation upon returning the iClicker to keep the program sustainable.</p>\n<p>“Based off our research, students are highly inclined if not really ecstatic to provide up to $5 to the association for providing such a service if it meant that that money was going to go to expanding such a service,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli addressed the specific concern of the $7 re-registration fee for students on used iClickers and suggested that donations generated from the $5 program could reduce the fee. Khazaieli also suggested potentially “striking a deal” with iClicker to get reduced rates.</p>\n<p>A.S. will be holding a finance meeting on Monday to “secure funding for the program,” according to Khazaieli.</p>\n<p>“If revenues are generated from the iClicker program … that money can go towards subsidizing this,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>The meeting concluded with senators passing two resolutions in support of a tuition hike op-ed and a BigBelly label and bin upgrade.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the February 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60534\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/senate-considers-iclicker-rental/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60534\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/senate-considers-iclicker-rental/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/senate-considers-iclicker-rental/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/senate-considers-iclicker-rental/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/senate-considers-iclicker-rental/","id":2910,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2909,2908,2907],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
