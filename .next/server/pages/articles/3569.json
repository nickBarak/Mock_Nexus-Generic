Seasoned trial lawyers and fresh faces out of law school knew that with a gavel in hand, the UCSB criminal justice professor was intelligent, probing and unpredictable all at once. His courtroom was his domain.</p>\n<p>After presiding over thousands of cases, the judge’s friends and co-workers – both in and out of the legal profession – are certain of one thing: The honorable Joe Lodge was absolutely committed to the ideals of his profession.</p>\n<p>“He tried very hard to bring justice to a coarse, harsh system,” said Benjamin Bycel, a prominent criminal attorney tapped to teach the remainder of Lodge’s criminal justice class at UCSB. “Joe tried to bring humanity and ethics into it. He wasn’t successful all the time and he was criticized for it, but his desire to consider the uniqueness of every case was well-respected.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When Lodge pulled into Santa Barbara in the late fifties things were different, Chief Assistant District Attorney Pat McKinley said. In Goleta and the surrounding area, the law was handed down through a Justice Court that met maybe two times a week – and judges did not even have to be lawyers.</p>\n<p>In 1958, the Goleta-Hope Ranch Justice Court judge was no lawyer. Senior Deputy District Attorney and friend Darryl Perlin said Lodge, fresh out of law school, decided to take a chance and give the incumbent a run for his money.</p>\n<p>“Joe Lodge, who knew very few people, did something which today is considered standard operating procedure in political campaigns, but back in 1958 it was unheard of,” Perlin said. “He decided that he would walk the precincts and introduce himself.”</p>\n<p>Lodge won the seat narrowly and never got up from the bench. Over the next half century, Lodge presided over his court in spite of severe back pain and a ten-year battle with lymphoma.</p>\n<p>“Judge Lodge could have retired 30 years ago at full salary but he didn’t,” Perlin said. “The reason was because of his love of the law and the job he did every day. He never missed work.”</p>\n<p>“You never knew exactly what to expect from him on the bench and I believe that’s exactly the way he wanted it,” William Makler, a defense attorney and former public defender, said</p>\n<p>Senior Deputy District Attorney Joyce Dudley said she first met the judge when she was just 19 years old. Lodge had ruled on a ticket she received for having an unleashed dog and she recalled how he told her to “sit” when she stood up out of place. The judge, she said, was sensitive and inquisitive but stood firm by his opinions.</p>\n<p>“He was a force,” Dudley said. “The man embraced life, embraced philosophy, embraced the law, embraced justice, and he was never interested in winning any popularity contests in terms of his rulings.”</p>\n<p>McKinley said that it is a known fact that plenty of lawyers disagreed with Lodge and that it was not easy to foresee his rulings.</p>\n<p>“He was unpredictable – unpredictable for both sides,” McKinley said.</p>\n<p>However, according to McKinley and Perlin, Lodge’s unpredictability was proof that he shot from the hip – and the fact that attorneys in court rarely moved to disqualify him is just the “proof in the pudding.”</p>\n<p>In 2002, a gala party was thrown for Lodge at the Montecito Country Club. The affair was, as his wife Sheila put it, “in lieu of” a retirement party. She said the judge was not about to step down from the bench.</p>\n<p>Perlin said it was also thrown because “it was not thought that he had much longer to live.”</p>\n<p>At the time, Lodge had been living with lymphoma for four years, McKinley said.</p>\n<p>“He handled [lymphoma] with a dignity and an openness that is rare in today’s day and age,” McKinley said. “He never really expressed fear of it. He beat back the cancer three or four times.”</p>\n<p>Perlin said that throughout Lodge’s battle with cancer, he continued to serve as a judge and professor.</p>\n<p>“Many a time, he would go for a cancer treatment in the morning and as soon as he had received it, he would be back on the bench as though nothing had happened,” Perlin said.</p>\n<p>According to Perlin, Lodge was a judge who would not quit, as he even out-lived his “memorial” party by six years.</p>\n<p>“It’s not often someone gets to come to their going-away party,” Perlin said. “But Joe Lodge didn’t go away.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16729\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16729\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-05-07/judge-joseph-lodge-1932-2008/","id":3566,"author":{"id":345,"name":"David Ferry"},"related":[3565,3564,3563],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Astronomers Strive For Global Network of Telescopes","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Santa Barbara's Las Cumbres Observatory is as immaculately clean as an operating room.

Instead, they look like large black boxes stacked on top of one another. It is hard to believe they cost $150,000.</p>\n<p>The next stop on the tour requires safety goggles. The machining room, which contains all the tools necessary to build a complete telescope, includes several pieces of equipment worth over $1 million. One of these machines is the vertical boring machine – a device used to shape cylindrical objects.</p>\n<p>The last stop of the tour leads outside the observatory to a shed in the parking lot. Inside the shed is Rosing’s prototype for one of his smallest telescopes: an approximately six-foot-tall cylindrical frame of metal. Connected to the structure is a computer, meant to document the telescope’s observations. The center of the metal frame holds a large, round, 40-centimeter in diameter mirror. This is definitely not a telescope meant for backyard observations. At the Las Cumbres Observatory, located at 6740 Cortona Dr., Rosing and his organization hope to build one of the world’s first intricate networks of telescopes across the globe.</p>\n<p>Do You See What I See?: A Global Network</p>\n<p>LCOGT is a privately funded, nonprofit scientific facility that plans to center its network of telescopes in Goleta. The organization will have all the telescopes connected via the Internet and will instantly pass on observations from one site to the next. LCOGT will deploy approximately 60 telescopes in at least six sites in different longitudes across the globe in both hemispheres, including Chile, South Africa, Australia, Hawaii and the Canary Islands.</p>\n<p>Lars Bildsten, a UCSB physics professor and theoretical astrophysicist, said the goal of LCOGT’s telescope project is to always have complete coverage of the sky. The project would also allow Bildsten to further his studies of the supernova – a large luminous explosion with the potential to radiate as much energy as the sun would emit over 10 billion years. Since supernovas only last a few weeks, being able to constantly observe them will make his research more thorough, he said.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested from the theoretical side of new data the network will provide,” he said.</p>\n<p>Rosing said once the project is completed, the telescope will allow researchers to respond to satellite reports of activity in the atmosphere instantaneously. Since LCOGT will place telescopes in locations all over the world with different time zones, Rosing said it will not matter what time of the day it is; it is always dark enough to observe the sky in at least one location.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have the first capability ever implemented at being able to do a very long series of observations of things that go bump in the night,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Rosing, such 24-hour surveillance will allow the scientific community to learn new facts about the stars. For example, he said that currently the vibrations of new stars can only be watched for about eight hours at a time. Without being able to watch the star for 24 hours straight, astronomers cannot fully understand the frequency of the star’s oscillation, he said.</p>\n<p>Space Is the Place: The Journey Ahead</p>\n<p>By the end of 2012, Rosing said his global telescope network will consist of approximately 40 0.4-meter telescopes, 20 one-meter telescopes and two two-meter telescopes. Currently, Bildsten said there is no standard size for telescopes, but the biggest ones are 10 meters, located at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Matt Dubberly, an LCOGT mechanical engineer, said a one-meter telescope will collect 100 centimeters of light, which is a much greater amount of light than the human eye can handle. On average, the human pupil is between 5.5-0.8 millimeters in diameter.</p>\n<p>Dubberly also said that all the one-meter and two-meter telescopes will be attached to 16 megapixel spectral cameras.</p>\n<p>“The cameras are 1,000 times more sensitive than your eye,” Dubberly said. “They get really high resolution pictures of faint objects out in space.”</p>\n<p>LCOGT Scientific Director Tim Brown said the sites for the telescopes were determined by how easy it would be to transport the telescopes, and whether or not Internet connectivity was possible. He said it is important to have Internet connectivity because the telescopes must be able to send information back to the database in Goleta.</p>\n<p>“[The telescopes] will be independent in the sense that each one can point anywhere in the sky at any target that’s visible to it at anytime,” Brown said. “But it will all be controlled from a central location.”</p>\n<p>The telescopes can also follow instructions sent from the central computer in Goleta and observe the same targets, he said.</p>\n<p>Bildsten said most sites will have three one-meter telescopes in case one breaks down. Brown said having three one-meter telescopes on each site will allow LCOGT to conduct different studies simultaneously in fields such as photometry, in which researchers study light intensity, and spectroscopy – the study of a material’s chemical composition via the light emitted.</p>\n<p>LCOGT will complete the first prototype for the one-meter telescopes by early 2009, Rosing said. By the end of 2010, the organization will deploy all the 0.4-meter telescopes, and by 2012, it will place all of the one-meter telescopes. Currently, LCOGT manages the two two-meter telescopes, called the Faulkes Telescope North – located at Haleakala in Maui, Hawaii – and the Faulkes Telescope South – located at the Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales, Australia.</p>\n<p>In addition to building telescopes, Rosing said the organization will require large amounts of data space to store all the information collected by the telescopes.</p>\n<p>“[The telescopes] will be generating a few hundred gigs a night of information, which will flow back to the large cluster computing facility,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>Even after all the telescopes are deployed, Rosing said the group must continue to maintain them by building and installing better cameras as detective technology improves.</p>\n<p>“Our plan for the next 20 years is to study and do as much science as we can,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>Brown said site preparation expenses – pouring concrete, putting in power-lines, placing telescopes and acquiring permits – cost at least $50,000. In addition, he said the 0.4-meter telescopes cost around $50,000 each to build, and the one-meter telescopes cost approximately $1 million.</p>\n<p>Universe-ity Collaboration</p>\n<p>Sometime between late summer and early autumn, Brown said LCOGT will place a 0.8-meter telescope at the UCSB-managed Sedgwick Reserve, located in the Santa Ynez Valley. This telescope will have an eyepiece on it, which means spectators can look through it, he said.</p>\n<p>Rosing said he chose to deploy a telescope at Sedgwick because LCOGT needed a large telescope to test and a relatively close dark sky site to test it.</p>\n<p>“After discussing it, it was obvious to us that making a telescope available to UCSB astronomers and students in general was an added benefit,” Rosing said.</p>\n<p>In addition, Rosing said Sedgwick has many outreach programs and a telescope would benefit those programs.</p>\n<p>“Part of the night is what goes on up in the sky, and it would be nice to be able to see it,” Rosing said. “We can do that from Sedgwick because it’s dark.”</p>\n<p>Rosing said the majority of engineering and manufacturing and all the software developments are done within LCOGT. However, he said LCOGT has an extensive collaboration in the astronomy field, including seven to 10 postdoctoral fellows connected with UC astrophysicists, UCSB, the University of Hawaii, UC Berkeley and the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</p>\n<p>In addition, Brown said LCOGT works with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope – an eight-meter telescope that will survey the entire sky and be operational in five years. Brown said the project also has other collaborations, including SuperWASP, a British organization that searches for new planets.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15987\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15987\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-02-26/astronomers-strive-for-global-network-of-telescopes/","id":3567,"author":{"id":344,"name":"Sabrina Ricci"},"related":[3566,3565,3564],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Years… and Counting","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-03-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For Maj.

Tasked with deposing the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and protecting the United States and her allies from the threat of weapons of mass destruction, the invasion force swiftly routed the Iraqi army.</p>\n<p>Seventy-six hundred miles away, back on our sunny campus, the war was the talk of the town. At least 1,000 UCSB students and staff members participated in a worldwide walkout, marching out of class and into Storke Plaza on March 5, 2003. In the coming weeks, rallies would continue on and off campus, and the pages of this paper’s opinion section would be stuffed with columns and letters about the prudence of preemption.</p>\n<p>However, five years later, some, like former marine-turned-political-activist Dave Hassan, have come to believe that the U.S. has separated itself from the situation in Iraq.</p>\n<p>“It’s really easy to just not be connected and just kind of being like, you know, ‘that sucks'” Hassan said. “The big difference between five years is, I guess, I’m connected.”</p>\n<p>Hassan – who has become vocal in the local peace movement since finishing his time in the Marine Corps as an Arabic translator – said that while he understands how Americans can push the war to the back of their minds, he said that “war is too fucking terrible for [him] to sit by.”</p>\n<p>“I think what really changed it for me was gaining a real sort of conception of what [doing my job as a Marine] really meant,” Hassan said. “When I saw people actually die, it really changed it for me. It shook me up. … I never actually shot anyone, but I have been responsible for people dying in the course of my job, and being responsible for that … actually changed my whole opinion. Gaining an actual connection to the Iraqi people. That’s what changed.”</p>\n<p>Gauchos in the Gulf</p>\n<p>Since 2003, UCSB’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps has sent between 40 and 50 graduates to the Middle East. And in those five years since the Iraq War began, Major Mike Salvo of UCSB’s Surfrider Battalion is proud to say that none of his cadets were wounded or killed.</p>\n<p>The ROTC program trains students throughout their time at the university and commissions cadets as 2nd lieutenants upon graduation. UCSB’s Surfrider Battalion Business Manager and Military Historian Patrick Coffield said last year was a great year for the program. The program commissioned 14 cadets as officers in the United States Army.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of UCSB ROTC graduates will see combat in the Middle East, Coffield said. He and Major Salvo estimated that 70 to 90 percent of graduates from the program find their way into combat situations.</p>\n<p>When asked about last year’s graduating class and why the service had received such a surge in enlistees, Coffield told this reporter to “Do the math.”</p>\n<p>Five years ago  – when the recent graduates were college freshmen – the memory of 9/11 was much more poignant, Major Salvo said, and the United States had just entered a war against one of the most maligned nations in the world.</p>\n<p>“People wanted to serve our country,” Coffield said.</p>\n<p>Brett Jordan, a 24-year-old native of Redondo Beach and 2006 UCSB grad, was part of that influx of students looking to serve their country. After four years of ROTC on campus, Jordan was trained for an additional six months and is now on his eighth month of service in the Anbar Province of Iraq.</p>\n<p> “My class was the first class to join post-9/11,” Jordan said. “We started school in 2002, so all of our class was the one that went in knowing ‘hey, we will definitely be going over there at some point.’ … A little daunting, but still good.”</p>\n<p>UCSB ROTC enrollment numbers are tapering down, however, and Coffield said he expects nine cadets to graduate this summer and another five the year after. Nationally, U.S. military recruitment is also declining, according to Department of Defense undersecretary David S. C. Chu.</p>\n<p>The seeming permanence of the war in Iraq, a negative view of military life and even the rising obesity rates – the military rejects a third of its applicants because of its physical fitness standards – were all cited as likely explanations for the decline.</p>\n<p>From Anbar, Two Different Views of the World</p>\n<p>Hassan and Lt. Jordan both served in the Anbar Province of Iraq. Jordan is currently stationed at al-Asad Air Base- the largest base in al-Anbar – and leads a truck company that drives freight liners packed with supplies throughout Iraq. Hassan was stationed at al-Asad a little more than two years ago, but spent most of his time in local towns.</p>\n<p>In Anbar, those two years made all the difference.</p>\n<p>Before September 2006, the region was famed for its violence, lawlessness and the harrowing battle of Fallujah. Since then, according to the New York Times, local Sunni tribes have come together to work with the U.S. military to oppose militant al-Qaeda operatives. The province is now one of the most stable in Iraq. Jordan agrees with the Times’ assessment and called it “one of the safest areas right now.”</p>\n<p>Hassan, who was stationed at al-Asad Air Base but spent most of his time in the cities of Al-Rutbah and Hit, described a different Anbar Province.</p>\n<p>“While I was there, there were a lot of attacks and we were in the process of leveling the place,” Hassan said. “We were bombing the shit out of the place.”</p>\n<p>Whether there is any correlation, both have come out of Iraq with very different feelings about America’s presence in the Middle Eastern nation.</p>\n<p>“We went in there and removed a government that wasn’t doing some things and the country needed help,” Jordan said. “When people say ‘no war, no war’, you know, war’s not fun. It never has been. But its necessary to do at times.”</p>\n<p>Hassan, on the other hand, said that he does not believe America’s presence in Iraq has or will help the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p>“What exactly is the end state we’re going for [in Iraq]?” Hassan said. “We empower death squads and war lords. … In what possible state of scenarios does that lead to democracy in Iraq?”</p>\n<p>Buried in Sand</p>\n<p>Generally, in Santa Barbara, the debate is similar. But the question of whether or not American boots on the ground in Iraq can salvage the country, naturally, has no exact answer.</p>\n<p>“There’s tears in a lot of people,” Michael “the Chaplain” Cervantes said yesterday at Arlington West. “They just don’t want to talk.”</p>\n<p>Cervantes – who is not a priest, but was dubbed “the Chaplain” by his fellow volunteer veterans because of his open ears – said mournful visitors from around the world tend to hold their hearts as they stand and look over the 3,000 small, white crosses planted onto the beach next to Stearns Wharf in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Michael Moore, a serviceman stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, said he believes the U.S. is “doing the right thing.” Holding his infant son yesterday while gazing upon the sea of crosses next to Stearns Wharf, Moore said he was touched by the memorial.</p>\n<p>“It brings tears to my eyes,” he said.</p>\n<p>Volunteers from the local chapter of Veterans for Peace set up the 3,000 crosses almost every Sunday morning to represent the lives lost in Iraq. Stephen Sherrill, the mastermind behind the project and the craftsman behind each cross, said when he started, the memorial had only 287 crosses.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-16182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-16182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-03-10/five-years-and-counting/","id":3568,"author":{"id":345,"name":"David Ferry"},"related":[3567,3566,3565],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
