We were somewhat out of our element, donned in work pants, gloves and wide-brimmed hats, on Don Israel’s farm in the small village of Ciudad Romero, El Salvador. With the sun approaching high noon, the heat made it hard work digging even a few feet of the ditch that would hold the piping for the irrigation system to be installed on the farm. Sydney Bennet — a first-year economics major at UCSB and “water-girl” for the day — called for everyone to take a break from working to hydrate. We layed down our tools and as we headed for our water bottles, the community leaders overseeing the irrigation project picked up the tools and continued work on the ditch. We watched them as they accomplished in a few minutes what had taken us an hour.</p>\n<p>“I don’t get it,” Sheila Ganjian — a fourth-year biology major who has plans of going on to medical school next fall — said. “How are we helping? Why do they need us?”</p>\n<p>They were pertinent questions, and ones volunteers on short-term service trips don’t always ask themselves. How does spending a week in a Third World country doing work that could be better done by the people of that country actually help? Wouldn’t the money spent traveling to that country be put to better use hiring native workers who desperately need the money or building infrastructure that the community desperately needs?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The American Jewish World Service (AJWS) attempts to answer these questions by transforming the short-term volunteer service trip into a learning experience. An organization inspired by Judaism’s commitment to social justice, AJWS strives to secure human rights and eradicate poverty around the world through grants, service trips, education and political advocacy. Alternative Spring Break trips are just one of the many service-learning travel opportunities offered by AJWS. Twelve students (including myself) recruited from UCSB and SBCC by Santa Barbara Hillel participated in an AJWS alternative Spring Break trip to El Salvador this past March.</p>\n<p>We knew we were going to a small village in El Salvador to do some sort of manual labor, but I don’t think anyone was fully aware of the type of experience AJWS had in mind. During orientation meetings we prepared for the physical labor aspect of the trip as well as the cultural side. We participated in activities designed to stimulate our cultural awareness and encourage us to immerse ourselves in the culture of the village. “Embrace the feeling of being uncomfortable,” they told us.</p>\n<p>Each day we were bused over to the farm and given tools to dig ditches for the irrigation pipes and holes for mango trees to be planted. It is rare to see a work project through to completion on an AJWS Spring Break trip, but we were fortunate enough to see the entire process of irrigating a farm.</p>\n<p>From AJWS’s point of view, however, the crux of the trip lays not in the labor but in afternoon and nightly discussion sessions aimed at getting us to reflect on our experiences and explore the meaning of social justice. Using a curriculum filled with Jewish texts and commentaries on global responsibility as our guide, we questioned our notions about global inequality and what our obligation really is to those in the world who are less fortunate than us. We learned about what it means to be in poverty, its causes and ways that we can help improve the quality of living for those in it. Through group dialogues we gradually came to understand that coming to El Salvador just to dig a few holes wasn’t doing enough. Rather, we’d be doing a greater good by learning as much as we could about the village and what makes it tick — what the biggest concerns are for its people and how they can thrive.</p>\n<p>As the week progressed, we began to develop a sense of the daily concerns of the village, not the least of which included U.S. policy toward Latin America. We were also fortunate enough to meet with Estela Hernandez, a woman from the Lempa River valley deeply involved in the work of La Coordinadora (a local organzation that oversaw our work), who was elected to the Salvadoran legislature a few weeks before our trip. When asked about her top political goals for her term in office, Estela responded that her top priority was to alert other nations — the U.S. in particular — to the issues affecting her people, and that she was grateful to have students from the U.S. come to learn about her community.</p>\n<p>These experiences helped drive home the point that we were there not to simply visit and then leave, but to bring back with us what we had learned and continue to help by gathering support for a just U.S. Farm Bill that promotes food sustainability in foreign countries as opposed to food aid, a short-term fix that undercuts local farmers.</p>\n<p>But not everyone was as grateful to have us there as Estela was. A sobering moment on the trip came when we visited a clinician’s office to learn about their health care system and kidney disease, which affects a disproportionate number of workers in Central America. We sat in the clinician’s office and asked her an assortment of questions about how health care works in the village. She gave long-winded explanations on topics such as who the clinic serves, how she became a doctor and what treatments she gives. When it came time for her to ask us questions, she only had one: “Why are you here?” Our group leaders’ answers about service and learning did not seem to satisfy her. She responded that it was puzzling to her how we could come for only a week and expect to have any impact, that we could do more by staying longer and teaching the local youth about hygiene and sexually transmitted diseases. As we continued to struggle to give her an answer she liked, her piercing gaze slowly diminished us and broke our hearts.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the clinician was right. Perhaps short-term volunteer trips have no point and are used more as an opportunity for us to travel the world than as a means to help. We did not need to be in El Salvador in order to learn about poverty, social justice, global responsibility and farming. Yet, each one of us was changed by the experience we had in the village. We went home feeling connected to El Salvador and to the people with whom we had spent each of our days there. You cannot connect with a group of people or learn what makes a village breathe by reading a book. You need to go there, eat their food, sleep in their homes and wake up to the sound of their roosters. You need to experience their daily work in the fields, put your hands in their soil and feel the singe of their scorching sun.</p>\n<p><em>Danny Sheinson is a third-year graduate student in statistics.</em></p>\n<p><em>For more information, please visit www.ajws.org or contact Santa Barbara Hillel.</em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

On Oct. 5, 2011, the American public was reintroduced to a genre that hadn’t been prominent in television for years, if ever: horror. Almost instantaneously, “American Horror Story” garnered a cult-like following, which has only seemed to grow with every new season of the anthology series. From the engaging imagery to the intricate storylines, there’s only so much one can fully process when watching “American Horror Story.” Often the show is taken for little more than entertainment value, and why not? It seems to do a good job at it.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Dec. 1, attendants of a show screening, followed by a talk and Q&amp;A segment with the show’s executive producer and UCSB alumnus Dante Di Loreto in Pollock Theater, got an inside perspective of what actually goes on behind the scenes of the mysterious and captivating series. As it turns out, there’s much more than meets the eye.</p>\n<p>Now in its fourth season, the series has brought back the same core cast to act out a variety of story lines, each exploring a different facet of American history and culture, from the Salem witch trials to the age of traveling freak shows and carnivals.  As it turns out, these seasons are not as divided as it may seem, and avid watchers of the show will soon begin to discover that the varying story lines are interconnected with each other. On this topic, Di Loreto diplomatically declined to offer any comment no matter how hard he was pried. Needless to say, this will call for many rainy afternoons spent re-watching the first few seasons (on Netflix) in search of clues.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The open question portion of the interview opened the floor to audience members to ask Di Loreto questions. Hearing the different questions revealed which unique aspect of the show each person liked most, and all the things different people can take from it. When asked why horror was chosen as the primary theme for the series, his answer was simple: it stimulates the senses. Evidently, horror sells for much of the same reason sex sells: It makes viewers feel something in their bodies that they don’t even need to wrap their heads around.</p>\n<p>Di Loreto also spoke candidly of his life leading up to becoming an executive producer, and all the steps it took to reach his position. This, of course, began with his time spent at UCSB as an undergraduate studying theater in the 1970s, when evidently students “were smoking in class and having sex with the teachers.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB alumnus offered advice on the most important part of becoming a producer, or anything in the entertainment industry, for that matter. His answer? “Friends.” Di Loreto stressed the importance of keeping close relationships with others who also hold a creative vision, and not being cynical about what you want to do. Through close relationships with like-minded people, avant-garde endeavors like “American Horror Story” are born.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/american-horror-story-producer-and-ucsb-alumni-comes-to-pollock/","id":6017,"author":{"id":743,"name":"Nadine Bedwan"},"related":[6016,6015,6014],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Electrosceptic’ Wow-ed by Gartner’s Performance, Despite the ‘Bleeps’ and ‘Bloops’","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Electronic music seems to be taking over the airways, but I have never been able to understand the allure behind it.

In fact, I hate it, and I always have. Whether it is house, techno, dubstep, trance or techno-house-step eurotrance, for me it all falls under the umbrella term of annoying white noise. My personal philosophy is that anything driven by bleeps, bloops, womps, oontzes or any combination thereof should be left out of the music category. Given my relentless distaste for such sounds, one could understandably assume that I did not care for Wolfgang Gartner’s performance at Extravaganza this weekend. As his set progressed, however, I found myself enjoying more and more the spectacle that was unfolding before me.</p>\n<p>As Wolfgang took the stage to play, my first instinct was to flee Harder Stadium and seek recluse in the safety of my apartment. Determined to at least try to broaden my horizons, I decided to simply retreat to the bleachers where I could observe the show from a safer distance. I went close to the very top, and had an excellent view of the mob that was quickly building up in anticipation of the coming storm. Many of my friends listen to electronic music, so I had heard a few of Wolfgang’s songs and thought I knew what to expect from him. What I witnessed next was, surprisingly, one of the most beautiful performances I have seen.</p>\n<p>I quickly realized that watching this type of music performed live in front of a huge crowd is much different than listening to it from a car stereo. Armed with his various synthesizers and sequencers, Wolfgang controlled the ebbs and flows of hundreds of onlookers with the prowess of an experienced puppet master. There was something transfixing about the way he could make them step, wave their arms, or jump in unison, all without uttering a word. While watching the crazed dances of a few ecstasy-driven concertgoers, the thought crossed my mind that this was probably the happiest moments they would ever experience, and I was honored to witness it. During one bass drop in particular, the collective orgasm that the crowd felt even sent shivers down my spine.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Perhaps my favorite part of Wolfgang Gartner’s performance was the fact that, out of everyone attending, he was clearly the one who enjoyed it the most. Too often do I see artists put on a half-assed show so they can collect their check and move on (certain Extravaganza headliners come to mind). In this case, the crowd fed off of Wolfgang’s energy, and it made the whole experience better. He was excited, which made the crowd excited, which made me excited. It was all very exciting.</p>\n<p>Coming out of Extravaganza, I could not say that I would be attending a rave anytime soon. Nor could I say that I liked electronic music anymore because of it. What I did gain was a better understanding of why this craze has swept the country over the past few years, especially within Isla Vista. There was a glimmer of hope that one day I might learn to appreciate these noises.</p>\n<p><em>Piers Fibige is a third-year political science and history major.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47188\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47188\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-25/electrosceptic-wowed-gartners-performance-bleeps-bloops/","id":6018,"author":{"id":505,"name":"PiersFibige"},"related":[6017,6016,6015],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Artsweek’s Favorite Villains of All Time","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There’s the spidery quirks of Cruella de Vil, the mad eyebrow game of Shan Yu, the utter insanity of Fred Figglehorn and the insidious charm of Richard III.

Let me preface this by saying I love dogs and don’t condone killing puppies to make coats, but still, I have to respect Cruella for her great fashion taste and boss attitude. Throughout the film, Cruella had a clear (okay, diabolical) goal and a set plan in mind to get things done. Rather than doing the dirty work herself, she employed two dowdy men to do the job and carried on her life of luxury and extravagance. For the most part, Cruella was the perfect picture of an independent woman with class and elegance, and she had an awesome collection of furs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">DR. HANNIBAL LECTER</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sophie Felice Ho, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Let’s talk charisma. In fact, let’s talk Hannibal. Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Protagonist in the third of a series of suspense novels, this cunning, cultured and multilingual psychiatrist not only delves in the brains of his mental patients — he eats them as well. He’s a cannibal with such class that he prepares gourmet meals from his victims’ flesh, served with a side of fava beans. He’s a master of irony, the man behind the chillingly-charming apology, “I do wish we could chat longer, but I’m having an old friend for dinner.” Besides the fact that he intends to literally have his old friend as dinner, his penchant for wordplay and courteous demeanor fools us all. Hannibal stands most intriguingly terrifying in my world of horror, luring victims in until it’s far, far too late to escape.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">DR. HEINZ DOOFENSHMIRTZ</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Erika Lee, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, the scatterbrained and forgetful evil scientist from “Phineas and Ferb,” is my favorite villain. A hilariously nonthreatening character, Doofenshmirtz is never taken seriously by any of the characters throughout the show. His one-sided rivalry with Perry the Platypus and his sinister plots to take over the tri-state area (that do not ever seem to succeed) never fail to entertain audiences of all ages. After it is revealed that the reason he creates his schemes and inventions is caused by the lack of recognition and love from his unhappy childhood, he becomes a more relatable and likeable character. What makes Dr. Doofenshmirtz so different from other villains is the fact that he’s not actually evil; he’s a human being with insecurities of his own. It also helps that his accent and famous line, “Curse you, Perry the Platypus!” is pretty fun to imitate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">SHAN YU</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kelsey Tang, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Fortune, beauty, love — these are typical goals that villains seek. Shan Yu of the Disney classic “Mulan,” however, seeks power. And in order to seize that power, he looks for complete annexation of China. What makes Shan Yu a respectfully cruel villain is his blindness to gender roles in a traditional, rigid setting that prohibits women from enlisting in the army. He recognizes Mulan as an equal opponent in strength and wit during a time period ridden with strict gender conventions. Shan Yu of the Huns, although unforgiving and brutal, still acknowledges Mulan’s capability. I’m impressed by his forward thinking, and I’m sure Mulan tacitly appreciated the acceptance.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">THE DALEKS</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Mackenzie Hart, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!” Anyone that follows the longest running sci-fi show of all time, “Doctor Who,” will recognize that this signature chant originates from the almighty villain of outer space: the Dalek. The Daleks are a strangely cute and simultaneously pesky race of cyborgs whose arms are composed of a plunger and a whisk that shoots lasers. As adorable as they sound, they are not the best kind of people — the reason why the Doctor is the last Time Lord alive is because the Daleks killed off all of the others, including his family. Although they appear to be relentless and stone-cold serial killers, it is revealed in an episode that they are not as inherently evil as they seem — underneath a Dalek’s armor is a little, lonely organism that has feelings too. They may be easy to hate; but as misunderstood little critters, they are hard not to like.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Chinelo Ufondu, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For many, Oct. 31 is a night filled with mischievous bliss and candy-toting children amiss, but for one it was the night where everything was destroyed. He was the most powerful, devious, sassiest dark wizard the world had ever seen. All cowered in his name — I urge you to not say it, for it could be the very last thing you utter. Those that dared to think he was vanquished clearly doubted the clever mind of You-Know-Who, who had a backup plan of survival and broke his immortal soul into pieces. Voldemort was a cunning badass of a wizard, equal parts smart and evil.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">YZMA</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Phi Do, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Flashy, bold and eccentric, Yzma from Disney’s “The Emperor’s New Groove” is always hatching grand schemes to get what she wants. One of her first plans to kill the emperor was to turn him into a flea, put him in a box, put that box in another box, mail that box to herself and smash it with a hammer (though she eventually settles for poison to “save on postage”). A woman of power, Yzma will go through great lengths to reach her goals, even when she gets dumped in a pile of jungle slime. She’s a woman of spunk who has her own roller coaster leading straight to the lab, as long as she presses the right lever, that is.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">MAN RAY</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alexandra DeSanto, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ma-ma-ma-MAN RAY! The most evil villain in all of Bikini Bottom has his own place in my childhood. The red and blue villain has his most famous scene when Spongebob and Patrick are watching over the lair of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. The best friends try to teach Man Ray to be a good person, resulting in Patrick dropping his wallet as a test. After grabbing the wallet and trying to hand it back to Patrick, Man Ray is refused repeatedly by Patrick, who claims, “Nope, not my wallet.” The exasperation on the face of the villain will forever have a place<br>\nin my memories, along with the giggles of me and my sister.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">THE JOKER</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alec Harnett, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My villain of choice would have to be from the adventures of my favorite comic series hero, Batman. Initially I would probably side with Mr. Freeze, but Heath Ledger’s performance as the Joker in “The Dark Knight” wins. The Joker is more menacing than the Riddler, a mysterious villain who sent dangerous gifts to his opponents, on which he would attach a small riddle that usually led to figuring out what the “present” was. Although similar in theatrical flair, the Joker is a crueler character; you do not know what’s coming until it’s already occurred and there is no way to stop him unless something extraordinary happens; at least the Riddler would leave a clue to let you know what was coming.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">FRED FIGGLEHORN</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Alex Wehrung, Reporter</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Fred Figglehorn in “Fred: The Movie” is one of the most defined villains in recent cinema: a stalker suffering from possibly schizophrenic hallucinations who will stop at nothing to get the girl he lusts after: Judy. What he intends to do when he “gets” her remains a mystery throughout the film. Fred is a truly terrifying presence. His high-pitched, constantly-screeching voice strikes terror into the hearts of his enemies and generally confuses everyone else.  He also demonstrates sociopathic tendencies when he pretends to invite people to his party, only to tell them they are not actually invited purely out of spite.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">RICHARD III</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Audrey Bachelder, Artsweek Editor</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Machiavellian Richard III is one of Shakespeare’s greatest masterpieces: a villain so criminally awful that it is almost seductive. Described as a horrifically hunchbacked man, Richard is grossly deformed and cannot walk “straight in front of a nymph.” So it’s a wonder that he is able to woo the beautiful Princess Anne, widow of the Prince of Wales whom Richard murdered.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">At first, Anne essentially tells Richard that he should go to hell, and Richard responds that he is fit for one more place: her bedchamber. He proceeds to tell her that her beauty kept him awake at night, and it forced him to kill her husband so that he might lay in her bosom for an hour. Anne, vain cat she is, unravels under the compliments, and she becomes a missus to the murderer. What is so invigorating about Richard is that he manipulates everyone around him and plays the role of an actor so well that his crudeness is taken for flattery.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57666\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/artsweeks-favorite-villains-of-all-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57666\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/artsweeks-favorite-villains-of-all-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/artsweeks-favorite-villains-of-all-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/artsweeks-favorite-villains-of-all-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/artsweeks-favorite-villains-of-all-time/","id":6019,"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor"},"related":[6018,6017,6016],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
