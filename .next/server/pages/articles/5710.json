He thrived on cultural trivia, arguments for the sake of debate and, most of all, plucky banter with his friends. After attending grad school at Georgetown, Steve traveled the world, bouncing from destination to destination, only to land at his final stop in Isla Vista. He had always been focused academically on math and science, but once he moved to I.V., he blossomed into the artsy-fartsy, free-spirited philosopher we all came to love. Then, with a few good friends and a strong peer group at his side, Steve opened a coffee shop called the Coffee Collaborative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Collab, as it was fondly addressed, was an offbeat and quirky shop on the corner of Pardall and Embarcadero. Never having been much of a businessman, Steve ignored traditional corporate tactics and, instead, transformed the Collab into a creative, alternative space. Although it didn’t seem exceptional to some, it was everything to its employees, regulars, locals and passersby. This became the home of debates, late-night talks, laughter, chess and community. It also became, perhaps infamously, a refuge for the lost, alcoholic, homeless and the poor. Regardless of how it was perceived from the outside, the Collab was always a place of belonging and forgiveness and was never a place for judgement — that was all Steve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One might even say that Steve was the purveyor of wayward souls. Perhaps he was so accepting of others because he, at heart, was a lost soul too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve was certainly not a hero, but he touched the lives of many young people; he spurred intellectual conflict, wafted at the edges of his beliefs and challenged those around him to do the same. Aside from being a philosopher, he was also an absurd comic and a wild storyteller. And although he was plagued by darkness, you’d never know it at the sound of his distinctive and well-loved laugh; it had a depth to it, came straight from the belly and would make you laugh along with him just at the sound of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like The Dude from “The Big Lebowski,” Steve always seemed to be caught up in some new fantasy or adventure. However aimless he seemed, his life was never dull and he was always able to find some sort of trouble or mischief. For those who knew him best, Steve was a complex, infectious and influential man full of love and turmoil. Whether he knew it or not, Steve was always surrounded by loved ones through his ups and downs, which was perhaps his greatest blessing. He will always be remembered by those who loved him as a staple, or perhaps a reflection, of Isla Vista and their time here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was and always will be a colorful thread in the fabric of our lives. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87176\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87176\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/","id":5710,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[5709,5708,5707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor","biography":"Not available","articles":[5709,5710,5717,6012,6093,6095,6096,6123,6125,6127,6128,6132,6151,6152,6160,6165,6172,6174,6175,6176,6178,6182,6187,6194,6195,6211,6215,6216,6218,6232,6247,6248,6252,6253,6260,6261,6314,6331,6343,6358,6393,6394,6396,6401,6412,6416,6423,6424,6439,6441,6446,6447,6456,6458],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Eleven Gauchos Qualify to NCAA West Regionals for Third Consecutive Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Track and Field","publish_date":"2017-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-30-at-3.55.18-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-30-at-3.55.18-PM.png?resize=980%2C618&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will once again have 11 Gauchos compete in the events set to take place at the University of Texas on Thursday in hopes of a top-12 finish to land a spot in the NCAA Final.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After stringing together a few stellar performances to end the season, including a tremendous showing at the Big West Championships at Cal State Fullerton, UCSB will once again have 11 Gauchos compete in the events set to take place at the University of Texas on Thursday in hopes of a top-12 finish to land a spot in the NCAA Final.

They will be led by the efforts of seniors Maxine Goyette, in the 3000m steeple, and Matthew Kuskey, throwing the javelin, both of whom are making their second consecutive Western Regional appearances.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Goyette finished with her best time ever in the 3000m steeplechase with a mark of 10:28.43 while taking silver during the Big West Championships last week, which thereby moved her to third all-time at UCSB in that event.

In just her sophomore season, she has moved into second all-time at UCSB in both of those events, and now she will be looking to build upon her early success in her first Western Regional appearance. She will be joined by senior Shannon Trumbull, as they both will represent UCSB in the women’s 400m hurdles.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting athlete to keep an eye on would be junior Jenna Hinkle, who has consistently improved her finishing times throughout her career and is also coming off an astounding 2016 cross country season, during which she established herself as a national contender after finishing fifth in the Stanford Invitational with a time of 20:31.1.</p>\n<p>She will be competing in the women’s 1500m after taking home gold for the second year in a row at the Big West Championships last week. Her PR of 4:16.67 last year is currently ranked No. 26 in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>Senior Tori Usgaard has done it all for the Gauchos since joining the program four years ago. Her versatility includes competing in the heptathlon, long jump, high jump, 4 x 400m and 100m hurdles, which are just some of the ways she has contributed to UCSB’s success in recent years. She will compete in the long jump when traveling to Austin this week after finishing with a mark of 19-04.25 at the Big West Championships.</p>\n<p>Concluding the women participants is senior Valerie Nestor, who, like Goyette, is peaking at the right time, considering she marked a personal best at the Big West Regionals with a 195-08 hammer throw. This will be her first time being invited to the Western Regionals in the hammer throw, and she has consistently made tremendous strides in her craft year after year to get to this point.</p>\n<p>Senior Adam Avila will be the sole male Gaucho competing in a running event. After claiming Big West Silver in the 3,000m steeplechase as a sophomore, Avila earned gold while in Fullerton with a time of 9:00.43, helping the Gauchos take the top-two conference spots in the event. Using back-to-back sub-nine minute efforts in the event over the course of seven days, Avila qualified for the NCAA First Round with a personal best time of 8:59.40.</p>\n<p>The remaining men’s track athletes will represent UCSB in throwing events, including senior Matthew Kuskey, senior Stephen Leach, junior Chris Ross and junior Kordell Hampton. In just his second season throwing the javelin, Kuskey qualified for the NCAA First Round in the event. He took home gold at the Big West Championships last week in the javelin with a throw of 218-08. He aims to return to the NCAA postseason and crack the UCSB All-Time list in the event. Ross will join him in the javelin at the Western Regionals after finishing second to Kuskey at the Big West Championships with a PR mark of 202-02.</p>\n<p>Hampton, UCSB school record-holder in the discus, came within an inch of his best mark to grab Big West silver. The junior, on his second to the last throw, found his place on the podium and notched his second-best career mark at 181-01. This will be his first appearance in the Western Regionals.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Leach will compete in the shot put after coming within a foot of his PR to score points in one of the deepest Big West shot put fields ever. Finishing eighth at the Big West Championships with a mark of 52-10.25, Leach looks to improve upon his achievements and be a formidable contender in the Western Regionals.</p>\n<p>Competition begins Thursday, May 25, with the 400m dash and concludes Saturday, May 27, with the 4x400m relay. As mentioned, the top-12 contenders will advance to the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championship set to take place from June 7-10 in Eugene, Ore.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78110\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/eleven-gauchos-qualify-to-ncaa-west-regionals-for-third-consecutive-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78110\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/eleven-gauchos-qualify-to-ncaa-west-regionals-for-third-consecutive-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/eleven-gauchos-qualify-to-ncaa-west-regionals-for-third-consecutive-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/eleven-gauchos-qualify-to-ncaa-west-regionals-for-third-consecutive-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/eleven-gauchos-qualify-to-ncaa-west-regionals-for-third-consecutive-year/","id":5707,"author":{"id":313,"name":"Austin Cole"},"related":[5706,5705,5704],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"An Open Letter to the UCSB Department of Geography","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2020-07-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/geography.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/geography.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Graduates of the UCSB geography community respond to a recent tweet put out by the geography department.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCSBgeog/status/1268645285170823168\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweet sent out by the UC Santa Barbara </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Department of Geography that was co-authored by department Chair Stuart Sweeney stated, “If there is anything we can do, please let us know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, Sweeney, there is plenty you can do.

It shows in the patriarchal culture the department embodies and perpetuates. It shows in the bankrupt values and ideologies the department institutionalizes and advocates. It shows in the department’s silencing and absencing of anything and anyone who questions or challenges its faulty and racist foundations and structure. It shows in the department’s legacy and habit of narrow white ways of knowing, thinking, acting and being. This is so apparent to us, because we have lived it. We have been laughed at for raising questions of difference. We have been told by you we do not belong.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It thus is not so surprising to us that your hollow letter of concern to the geography community glosses over the death of George Floyd in such passing as to be completely tone deaf, at best, and purposely dog-whistling at worst. Floyd’s murder is not even the intention or attention of your sentence or concern. You say, “We realize these are indeed troubling times on many fronts,” and you associate what is troubling with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">events that</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">followed </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his killing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be amusing to note, if not for the direness of this reality you contribute to, that your reference to the vile and unjust public execution of Floyd is myopically entangled within your seemingly indelible white privilege: how faculty must “grapple” with having to work from home. Is that really the reach of your concern? Is that really the best that you can do?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently, it is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">event of Floyd’s murder</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> deserves explicit recognition, direct condemnation and corrective actions. As do the murders of Breonna Taylor, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Ahmaud Arbery, Stephon Clark and so many other Black people at the hands of those who are supposedly there to serve and protect. Does this trouble you? Or, do the “many fronts” of concern you mention express the vocal and visible challenges now being presented to the white hegemony the department has for so long promulgated and promoted? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You and every UCSB chair of geography before you have led a department that has policed the gates of opportunity and kept them away from Black, Brown and Indigenous scholars. You and every chair of the department before you have, on several occasions, presided over a faculty that has turned down exceptional Black and Brown hires, including an African-American woman, a woman of African origin and a Nepalese woman, only to hire more white faculty. You and every chair before you have embodied a department that has done nothing to level the playing field with your privilege. The word “diversity” is spoken at faculty meetings as a token nod to progressive values, but you do nothing to make the department more welcoming to and inclusive of non-white students and potential Black, Brown and Indigenous faculty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know what we DON’T need: more diversity seminars, webinars, colloquiums and forums that you can check off your to-do list. We DON’T need Black and Brown students and faculty to shoulder the burden of changing a system that claims “freedom of thought” but ends up keeping that platform for white voices, values and modes of geographical thought, methodologies, scholarship and activism.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You and every UCSB chair of geography before you have led a department that has policed the gates of opportunity and kept them away from Black, Brown and Indigenous scholars. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a discipline that literally has the world as its focus, your myopic views and behaviors are an embarrassment and a failure. You uphold the racist and colonial legacy of geography by not confronting this very real history of the discipline, and you advocate and perpetuate these racist and colonial tendencies today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this truly brings you discomfort, if there is a modicum of sincerity in your message, you may then be asking: what CAN I do? The answer is: begin to change the entire structure of your department from within to work for corrective justice inside and outside your halls of privilege. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start teaching about the racist and colonial history of the very discipline you purport to represent. Step outside your comfort zones of white privilege and incorporate into all classes geographical issues of race and racism, privilege and marginalization, gender and identity, and resource destruction and exploitation. Actively recruit Black scholars and other scholars of color. Actively work with, take direction from, and cite and publish with Black, Brown and Indigenous scholars. Actively examine the biases in your own work, in your own choices, and in your own institutions and power structures. And explicitly recognize and vocalize that electing a faculty of color as chair is far overdue. Actively work to change and correct this. And for the sake of all and any gods, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">educate yourself</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this is what you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can do</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And if there is any grain of sincerity in the department’s message, all of these steps must begin to be taken </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NOW</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Recalling the words of Dr. King:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that       over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, yes, these are indeed troubling times. Especially when your thoughts, given in abstract sympathy and for dubious ends, only serve to re-traumatize and build dams against a student body that has faced discrimination from your department since day one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your brief, ambiguous message presents and represents the full extent that this department is willing to go to in order to acknowledge what is happening outside the ivory tower, and we mean </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ivory</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the only purpose it serves is to give comfort and satisfaction to those already enjoying the white privilege and power that tower provides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your next actions are as a chair and as a department — and make no mistake, silence and upholding the white status quo </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is action </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— will be revealing of the sincerity or insincerity of your message to us, marginalized members of the UCSB geography community. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">G</span><span style=\"font-weight:

We can hardly remember what it was like before the debut of the iPhone in 2007 — just 13 years ago.

I have spent 95% of my time during the past two and a half months indoors in my apartment in Isla Vista. COVID-19 has forced an evolution to remote learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote learning is efficient, or at least it was intended to be. The idea is simple: By cutting out some of the unnecessary parts of daily life at a university, such as commuting and coming and going from class to class, we save time. It is meant to be a direct connection to knowledge and professors. Yet my experience is that there are a lot more factors to take into account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, not going to school breaks the psychological state of studying. Rolling out of bed and opening my 32-inch display screen, which I also use to watch YouTube and play games, doesn’t make me feel like studying. I try my best to avoid using my laptop for leisure during the day, but it’s unavoidable. It requires much persistence to stay focused. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is simple: By cutting out some of the unnecessary parts of daily life at a university, such as commuting and coming and going from class to class, we save time.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compare this to sitting in a classroom, which is quiet and has hundreds of people around you studying. Even if you drift away for a bit, you usually come right back to focus because it “feels” like the right thing to do. As far as efficiency is concerned, while cutting back some inefficient activities, remote learning also introduces new ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, because it is more or less a forced change, a lot of details have not been figured out. For example, many lecturers are not used to writing on a tablet and screen recording, so now, they make videos talking over prepared slides. As a result, students can no longer see the steps of derivation, and they lose their natural signs and annotation in graphics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue is with homework grading. The process usually involves students handing homework into a collection box before a deadline; then, the TA would collect them and distribute them to graders. Now, many classes use the GauchoSpace built-in function, which is, to put it mildly, bad for anything that requires stepped grading and commentary. Luckily, some commercial solutions exist, and many classes in S.T.E.M. subjects are utilizing them. It is impressive to see classes quickly learning to use these new tools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, I think COVID-19 has forced innovation and exploration on the individual level, and remote learning will be a good thing in the long run. We are prepared to find a new way of living and learning with more resilience.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Jerry Ling</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hitherto, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has already</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> surpassed 2 million in America</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which represents </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over a quarter of the known cases</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the world. As the most powerful country with access to some of the best medical care and most advanced technologies, it is worth considering why there are a rising number of cases in the U.S. because this pandemic affects not only the overall economy of the nation, but also every one of us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I appreciate that UCSB had changed its teaching mode to online before the coronavirus was widely spread. With this opportunity, I have returned to my home country, where the situation is mostly under control. Thanks to my professors, I do not have to stay up late to participate in live meetings because of my current time zone. In hindsight, I believe that although remote learning does have its deficiencies, it is undoubtedly an effective measure under these unusual circumstances.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, I believe that although remote learning does have its deficiencies, it is undoubtedly an effective measure under these unusual circumstances.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have been successful in keeping our classes up and running by leveraging our technology. Besides some of the negative experiences that remote learning may bring us, I think that it can also benefit us in many ways. For example, students save time they would normally spend commuting, therefore freeing up more time for focusing on their studies. They are also able to watch the recorded lectures repeatedly to strengthen any points in their classes they do not understand. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we have had to abandon face-to-face conversations, I think this is an acceptable change. Nothing is more important than our collective safety. Turning to the discussion on online examinations, I do want to stress that teachers should be more flexible and considerate with students. We are all uneasy because of the current circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From my point of view, remote lecturing has been quite successful at UCSB. However, I am suspicious about the assertion that students can return to the campus in September. Although I have complete faith in UCSB’s resilience, I believe it is too early to make decisions. The situation seems to be persistent and since this type of lecturing is working, I think we should continue to learn online in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Robert Chen</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid problems like Internet connectivity and time zone differences, I chose to remain in Santa Barbara during this period of remote learning. I was pretty optimistic about the epidemic at the time, and I thought that the situation would surely improve before summer vacation. So, I rented a house with my friend in Goleta and was ready to get used to this new learning method. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, spring quarter did not proceed as successfully as I anticipated. As a pre-chem student, I had to take two labs this quarter. It was very inconvenient to conduct both of the lab courses in an online format. Students had no access to manipulate data and make measurements by ourselves. Although TAs would record experiment videos for us, the experiments were not conducted by our own hands, and there were always some problems that we could not understand. We had to repeatedly stop and ask questions when finishing our lab reports, which was time-consuming. In addition, the lab manuals were partly revised because of the online learning. In one class, we needed to spend an extra two to three hours to complete each lab report. It seemed we did not truly grasp the knowledge we needed to learn in labs, and we wasted a lot of time.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope that my flight in June will not be cancelled and that I will be able to get back to my family.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did see some positive results from online learning. Many of my courses were recorded. This meant that I could choose when to study according to my habits. I did not have to get up early to catch the bus to campus and have to feel tired. I obtained a lot more sleep than I usually have and was more energetic when studying. In this way, online learning was helpful; however, I found I was not disciplined at home without a structured campus schedule. It was hard to be persistent with online learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 virus outbreak turned out to be much worse than I expected. I hope that our in-person interactions will return as soon as possible. My roommate got a flight to return home two weeks ago, so I am the only one left in the house. The air tickets are very expensive and difficult to purchase now. I hope that my flight in June will not be cancelled and that I will be able to get back to my family.</span></p>\n<p>– <em>Candace Chen</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-95010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-95010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/","id":5709,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[5708,5707,5706],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
