They added one run to their lead in the top of the third inning to make the score 2-0.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the third frame the Trojans woke up as they rallied a four-run inning, due in large part to senior out fielder Timmy Robinson’s three-run homer, to take the lead at 4-2.</p>\n<p>They then added one run in the fifth as well as the sixth, thanks to another Robinson home run, to extend the lead to 6-2.</p>\n<p>In the sixth inning USC put away the Gauchos scoring three more runs courtesy of junior catcher Jeremy Martinez two-RBI double, and Robinson’s sac-fly RBI.</p>\n<p>UCSB tried to respond scoring two runs in the seventh after redshirt junior out fielder Andrew Calica’s two-RBI triple but it would not be enough as it eventually fell to the Trojans 9-5. The loss snapped the previous nine-game winning streak Santa Barbara was on.</p>\n<p>Pitchers Joe Record, a sophomore redshirt, and Chris Clements, a sophomore, both struggled in the game. Record (3-2) picked up the loss after allowing five runs on seven hits in four innings while Clements allowed four runs on five hits in 1.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Before the tough loss that snapped their streak, the Gauchos extended it to nine after another home victory. Solid pitching was the key in this game as the team of Noah Davis and Kyle Nelson held the Trojans to two runs.</p>\n<p>USC began the scoring in this game after senior David Oppenheim hit an RBI double down the left field line to take the early 1-0 lead. Its lead was extended to 2-0 in the third after an error by the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB began its comeback in the bottom of the fourth frame when Adams hit a two-run double to tie the game at 2-2. It then took the lead in the fifth inning after an RBI single by sophomore DH Austin Bush which brought Calica home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added one run in both the sixth and eighth inning thanks to freshman Michael McAdoo’s RBI fielder’s choice and redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno’s RBI triple respectively.</p>\n<p>Davis (2-0), a freshman, pitched a solid game allowing one earned run on four hits and struck out four batters on six innings pitched earning him the victory.</p>\n<p>Nelson also continued his excellent season picking up his second save after pitching three innings and allowing three hits and no runs. The sophomore has only allowed one run the entire season.</p>\n<p>To begin the three-game series, Santa Barbara came into the match-up looking to avenge the loss that knocked them out of the regionals last year. Coming in hot, off two previous weekend sweeps, it was ready to get some sort of revenge.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out swinging and put away USC early. It out hit USC 12-6 and scored 10 runs while holding USC to one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began the scoring putting three runs on the board in the bottom of the second inning courtesy of one Trojan error and a two-run homer by Adams, his fourth of the year.</p>\n<p>They added two more runs in the fourth inning courtesy of Calica’s RBI single and a balk committed by the pitcher led to senior Ryan Clark scoring making the score 5-0.</p>\n<p>USC added one run in the fifth inning but it was not enough as UCSB proceeded to score five runs over the next two innings to secure the 10-1 victory. It was the sixth time it scored 10 or more runs in a game.</p>\n<p>Clark had a solid game going 3-4 (.750) with one RBI and two runs scored. Another notable hitter was junior utility Billy Fredrick who went 2-4 (.500) with one run scored and one RBI.</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Shane Bieber (4-1) picked up his fourth win of the season after going seven innings and allowing only one run on five hits while registering two strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The big lead allowed coach Checketts to throw in freshman pitcher Kevin Chandler to get some solid playing time. The right-hander pitched two full innings, almost as much as he pitched in his previous four games combined, and allowed one hit, no runs while striking out two batters.</p>\n<p>The weekend was another solid one for the UCSB baseball team. It won another series and although it’s winning streak was stopped, there is no doubt that the team is having a great season thus far.</p>\n<p>However, it will be important to see how Santa Barbara bounces back after a loss. Also the team will be away from home for the next seven games so it will be interesting to see how that could possibly affect the team.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Tuesday, March 29 against Pepperdine at 3 p.m at Eddy D.

But with the help of perfect timing and a movie that changed her mind, Xu decided to open her wallet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw a Korean movie about policemen who watch drug dealers from a fried chicken place across the street. The fried chicken place was about to close down, so they bought the place to watch the drug dealers,” Xu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three days later, Xu offered to purchase Sweet Alley from Sun on a whim, who had been struggling to find a new owner for months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw [Sun’s] advertisement, and then the next day, I asked him if [Sweet Alley] is still on the market. He said, ‘Yes.’ And then the next day, I gave him the deposit.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With renovations set to begin next month, Xu wants to welcome customers with a completely new interior. On top of selling the frozen yogurt equipment, she plans to tear down old walls and refurnish the entire store; she is also flirting with obtaining a light liquor license. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The internal wall will be knocked down and moved further back, and I’ll add a small countertop so this whole area can be a sitting area,” she said, pointing to the concrete slab where customers used to walk up to get their frozen yogurt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TVs and dessert are also on Xu’s short list of amenities to include at her Vons, on top of the boba she plans to bring daily from Phresh Teas, a restaurant of hers dedicated to serving a variety of different tea creations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the unit’s small footprint, Xu estimates she will need roughly half the amount of employees she has staffed at her other restaurants. Instead of hiring former Sweet Alley employees, Xu said she will be “pick[ing] from Uniboil staff” and offering them a spot at the new store. Xu expects Vons will be managed by the wife of the current Uniboil head chef.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure authenticity, Xu said Vons flies trainers directly from South Korea to host trainings for employees whenever a new store opens — a franchise policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Uniboil, which follows a more traditional restaurant style, Xu plans to make Vons more expedient so customers can just “grab and go.” If a customer simply wants to buy food and leave, Xu estimates they can be on their way in as little as 10 minutes. If customers would like to stay and eat, however, they’ll have plenty of time to choose when to come in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, I’m thinking Monday through Thursday, we’ll do 3 o’clock to 11 o’clock and 3 o’clock to two in the morning Friday through Sunday,” Xu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If fried chicken isn’t enough to fill customers’s stomachs, Xu said desserts will be available as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll be selling boba cake — a milk tea cake with boba on it — and also coconut jellos, which is made of coconut juice and real coconut with jello inside. We’ll also be selling Hong-Kong style desserts and street food,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further impress palates, Xu said she is working with a local chef who is skilled in making authentic “Chinese street snacks.” She said the chef currently works from home and only delivers food from his house. If everything goes according to plan, Xu said, those street snacks may soon be on Vons’ menu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xu also plans on developing a “really strong delivery system.” Not only will this allow Vons to serve food beyond its own walls, but it will also help the store remain competitive, as most restaurants in I.V. offer some form of delivery service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she has a lot of work ahead of her in the coming months, Xu said she is looking forward to the day she can flip the “closed” sign outside the store, which will be sometime in the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once complete, Xu said Vons will be the sole restaurant in I.V. where customers can sink their teeth into Korean-fried “flats” and “drums” — the industry-standard cuts of chicken that are commonly fried into delicacies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no good fried chicken around here. We only have KFC — not even a Popeyes or Wingstop. We don’t have anything. That’s why I think this will be a really good idea for a chicken place,” Xu said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 version of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

They will now look to avenge their rough start to conference play when it takes on a solid opponent Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara won the series after taking two of three from the Rainbow Warriors but is losing the series history which stands at 17-10. However, in recent years the Gauchos have taken 10 of the last 15 games.</p>\n<p>Currently, UCSB is in the midst of a 13-game home winning streak and if it can take the first two games from Hawaii it will set a new school record for most consecutive home wins, 15.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is also off to its best record at home start in school history at 17-1 beating its previous mark of 16-2 which was set in 1984.</p>\n<p>In order to pull off the upset and beat an almost unbeatable Gaucho team at home, the Rainbow Warriors will need to rely on senior star Jacob Sheldon-Collins.</p>\n<p>Currently, the shortstop has the second best batting average in the Big West with a .401, is tied for the conference leads in hits (57), and leads the team in on-base percentage (.443) and runs scored (20).</p>\n<p>He is helped by freshman catcher Kekai Rios who has the sixth best batting average in the Big West at .339. This season, the young Hawaii native has also hit a game-winning home run this season. Sophomore first baseman Eric Ramirez leads the team in RBI with 26.</p>\n<p>These great hitters will be facing off against pitcher Shane Bieber. The junior currently has a 3.30 ERA with a 7-2 record.</p>\n<p>Bieber has pitched three straight complete games with the last one being his worst after going eight innings allowing seven runs and 13 hits. He will look to turnaround his performance and hopefully tie his career high, eighth win of the season.</p>\n<p>The pitcher will also look to be helped by the great hitting staff of the Gauchos. Coming off a solid game on Tuesday is second baseman J.J. Muno.</p>\n<p>The sophomore went 2-4 (.500) with two runs scored including the game-winner in the eleventh inning. He is tied for the team lead in home runs with four on the season and currently bats .269.</p>\n<p>Another solid hitter is designated hitter/first baseman Austin Bush. The redshirt sophomore is first in RBI (26), first in slugging percentage (.475) and third in batting average (.308).</p>\n<p>This weekend will be an interesting one for the Gauchos as they will need to go back to their winning ways and make a splash in conference play.</p>\n<p>They were projected to finish fourth in the Big West in the preseason poll, however, the talent this team has and the determination it has displayed proves they have the capability to finish much, much higher.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces-off against Hawaii Friday, April 29 at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Saturday’s and Sunday’s game will be at the same location but at 2 p.m. and 1 p.m. respectively.</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: A previous version of this article said the Gauchos needed to sweep the weekend series to set the school record for most consecutive wins at home. The Gauchos only need to win the first two games to reach 15 straight wins, beating the previous school record of 14.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
