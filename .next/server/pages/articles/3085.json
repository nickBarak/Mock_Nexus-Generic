Yang. Also during Public Forum, Hani Tajsar of Students for Justice in Palestine addressed the Senate regarding an Israeli bus company that recently designated separate bus lanes for Palestinians.</p>\n<p>According to Haile, BSU intends to make the UCSB campus more welcoming to minority students through the new proposals — which include hiring two new black psychologists on campus, gaining access to contact information for black alumni, the implementation of a permanent student activism center and holding deans of each college accountable for the recruitment of black faculty.</p>\n<p>According to Haile, UCSB should hire two Black psychologists since it currently lacks such adequate support systems for minority students, with this deficiency due to the university’s racial demographics and general campus climate.</p>\n<p>“The campus, as a whole, is not very friendly to students of color,” Haile said. “Our numbers are very, very low so our support services are very low.”</p>\n<p>As an immigrant and first-generation college student from a low-income family, Haile said acclimating to life at UCSB has not been an entirely smooth experience, and said this feeling is one felt by many students on campus.</p>\n<p>“Once [you] get here, you’re essentially taken out from your support system,” Haile said. “All of a sudden you’re in a more hostile environment than you came from.”</p>\n<p>Another topic presented during Public Forum was a request by Students for Justice in Palestine calling for the Senate to divest from companies that can be considered supportive of human rights violations in the region, singling out an Israeli bus company that recently launched segregated bus lanes for Palestinians, according to Tajsar.</p>\n<p>Tajsar, member of Students for Justice in Palestine, addressed the Senate and urged its members to divest from companies supportive of segregation and other infringements on human rights.</p>\n<p>“Separate is not equal in any context,” Tajsar said. “We should all take into account human rights and justice as a huge priority … [and] divest from any company that has any sort of financial investment in [violations of] human rights.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ASMeet_AlejandroGonzalez_3-6-13-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1669648234\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50560\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50537\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-07/gauchos-battle-for-position-host-titans/asmeet_alejandrogonzalez_3-6-13-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ASMeet_AlejandroGonzalez_3-6-13-5.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1362525967\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"113\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"ASMeet_AlejandroGonzalez_3-6-13 (5)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ASMeet_AlejandroGonzalez_3-6-13-5.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ASMeet_AlejandroGonzalez_3-6-13-5.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50537\" alt=\"ASMeet_AlejandroGonzalez_3-6-13 (5)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ASMeet_AlejandroGonzalez_3-6-13-5-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ASMeet_AlejandroGonzalez_3-6-13-5.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ASMeet_AlejandroGonzalez_3-6-13-5.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>ALEJANDRO GONZALES / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Hani Tasjar, of Students for Justice in Palestine, spoke in last night’s A.S.

SCORE focuses on any issues regarding students of color on campus and helps fund over 100 UCSB multicultural organizations, according to SCORE Co-Chair Navkiran Kaur.</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, this weekend’s conference was one of the group’s most important events of the year.</p>\n<p>“We fund the delegation of UCSB students to go to the Student of Color conference which is an annual statewide conference,” Kaur said. “The other huge thing we do is this Facing Race conference, which is our own UCSB-wide annual conference.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaur, violence was chosen as this year’s topic due to the prominence of issues like gun control and terrorism in national discourse.</p>\n<p>“We felt violence was a very prevalent topic in today’s time, what with the professional violence that occurs in India, the different issues with gun control going on, terrorism, like so many different ideas of violence, it’s not just that mainstream idea of a gun,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>One of two guest speakers, Outreach Coordinator and Santa Barbara Unified School District consultant Ismael Huerta spoke on the importance of family ties and secure communities for future generations as a way of avoiding the spread of violence.</p>\n<p>Along with the set of lectures, SCORE held 16 different workshops available within three distinctive time ranges throughout the day. A workshop on the growing trend of terrorism as a method of violence hosted by A.S. Outreach Coordinator for Human Rights Board Will Ellis entitled “Who’s the Real Terrorist?” detailed the classification of certain groups as terrorists and the various outcomes that have resulted from creating stereotypes.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Lizeth Lomeli attended Ellis’s workshop and various other lectures during the event after learning about Facing Race through Womyn’s Commission. According to Lomeli, learning about terrorism from the point of view of those who have been wrongfully discriminated against opened up her perspective.</p>\n<p>“It was super interesting because I’ve never gotten that point of view from, I guess, people who have been called terrorists or have faced issues in post-9/11 aftermath society,” Lomeli said.</p>\n<p>Another workshop, “Migrant Realities” explained immigration policies from the past and their effects on the immigrant population of today.</p>\n<p>“I have parents who are immigrants and it was really interesting to hear those points of views from students who are undocumented now and just the bravery and courage that it takes for them to continue being in school and in an environment where they are risking everything to somehow better themselves,” Lomeli said.</p>\n<p>Attendees were also able to utilize caucus spaces, which served as meeting rooms for students who were interested in specific topics such as Mixed Heritage and Womyn of Color. Along with the guest speakers, workshops and meetings, Facing Race included entertainment at the end of the day’s events featuring Mexican folklorito dancers, SCS Zhangra Punjabi folk dancing and Iaorana te Otea traditional and modern Polynesian dances.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science and French double major Jonathan Fackler, a member of the Sigma Chi Omega fraternity, participated in his fraternity’s singing performance at this year’s Facing Race.</p>\n<p>“We were doing the performance and we thought ‘hey let’s check out the event and support our fellow fraternity members’, and it turns out, you know, this event was really well-coordinated,” Fackler said. “There were a lot of people, a big supportive crowd, food, snacks, the performances were amazing and it was really entertaining.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6> This article appeared on page 6 of February 25th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50329\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50329\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-25/associated-students-hold-symposium-about-violence-effects-on-underrepresented-students/","id":3082,"author":{"id":198,"name":"Carly Bates"},"related":[3081,3080,3079],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

They attributed all of this to the disruption in their pay, an issue they said plagued both undergraduate and graduate students.</p>\n<p>“When we are unable to fulfill our financial obligations as students, such as paying tuition and fees, we are penalized,” UAW member Mariah Clegg said, reading the letter to Yang and other administration members seated around the table.</p>\n<p>“Why shouldn’t the university be held accountable for compensating workers for the losses caused by its failure to pay workers on time?”</p>\n<p>UAW presented several demands to the administration in their letter, the most urgent of which asked UCSB to pay all workers what they are owed by Feb. 1.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people are told that someone is working on it, but it’s not always clear what that means, if there’s any sort of timeline,” Lisa August-Schmidt, sergeant at arms on the UAW Statewide Executive Board, said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>“In general, what I’ve found to be incredibly frustrating in dealing with the university via Labor Relations or directly, [is that] they’ve been really unwilling to acknowledge how big of a problem this is.”</p>\n<p>Administrators continually noted throughout the meeting that while they knew about the pay problems and had been actively working to fix them, they had been unaware of many of the ripple effects of the delayed pay. They thanked the members for bringing it to their attention.</p>\n<p>Marshall admitted there was a “flaw in the design” of UCPath and said the administration was working to help address students’ grievances.</p>\n<p>“We’re meeting about this every week and trying to make it work,” he said during the meeting. “I think we’ve made some progress, but every new payday is another test of the system.”</p>\n<p>The union members shared personal anecdotes regarding their own experiences with UCPath to emphasize the urgency of the problem.</p>\n<p>One member said she had been overpaid by $900 during Fall Quarter 2018. After returning the money then, she said she received a letter on Jan. 15 saying that she needed to pay the money back by Jan. 14, or it would be sent to collections.</p>\n<p>“On top of missing pay, many workers were faced with credit card late fees, unexpected transportation costs when bus passes were denied due to late fee remission, and were forced to skip meals to make ends meet. One worker’s car was repossessed for not making timely payments,” the letter stated.</p>\n<p>UAW representatives and administrators agreed that communication was one of the largest issues exacerbating the payment issues; both noted that there was not one office that students could approach if they were experiencing payment issues.</p>\n<p>One of UAW’s demands was to establish a single point of contact “so that workers’ problems do not have to go through multiple bureaucratic layers before coming to the attention of UCPath,” the letter stated.</p>\n<p>Throughout the meeting, Yang asked his administrators about what issues could be solved immediately, expressing concern that there were still students not being paid on time, leaving them unable to pay rent.</p>\n<p>He was especially thrown off by the figure listed in the letter, which stated that “none of the thirty-some tutors and readers in the Accounting program were paid at all during fall quarter as a result of complications with UCPath.”</p>\n<p>Since its implementation at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018, UCPath, a program aimed at streamlining the way all UC workers get paid, has caused an uproar among student workers at UC campuses, primarily graduate students.</p>\n<p>The union first filed a grievance regarding UCPath issues on Oct. 19, according to August-Schmidt. The union put out a survey on Oct. 8 regarding UC Path’s issues; they have received over 500 responses across the UC system so far.</p>\n<p>One of the difficulties with the new system is that it consolidated payroll at UC Riverside, meaning that individual campuses had less power to address any issues that emerged.</p>\n<p>UAW workers at UCSB felt that the deployment of UCPath at other campuses should be delayed until the full scope of problems it has caused has been solved.</p>\n<p>“There hasn’t really been a satisfying acknowledgment of the kind of havoc this creates in people’s lives,” August-Schmidt said.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Feb. 2]</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at evelyn@dailynexus.com.
