The meeting also addressed the success of this year’s Deltopia festivities and the continuing security of I.V. in future years with regard to the festival.</p>\n<p>The reputation and presence of Greek organizations on campus was also discussed, with an emphasis on looking toward greater unity between Greek organizations and the university for future events.</p>\n<p>The senators heard from representatives from C.A.P.S about the organization’s future plans and needs. Assistant Clinical Director of C.A.P.S Turi Honegger said a new wellness center is going to open in I.V. in 2015.</p>\n<p>“I have seven offices that are going into Isla Vista,” Honegger said. “It’s going to be above the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic. Four of those offices are going to be dedicated to full-time psychologists. That will be available for all students and any I.V. resident can get a consultation.”</p>\n<p>According to Honegger, the C.A.P.S program is very popular with a significant portion of the student body, bringing in nearly 25 students for initial mental health assessments on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>“That’s over one hundred a week, and over the course of a quarter that’s over five percent of the student body,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S Student Mental Health peer Janice Ong said the mental health peer program could use more space.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing as best we can to provide mental health services to students, but expansion can be done in this situation,” Ong said. “For example, as of now we don’t have a dedicated space for students to come in to talk, usually when drop-ins happen we try our best and maybe a clinician can give up their office for twenty minutes for us to use.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year psychology and sociology double major Ali Guthy introduced the Senate to the Dear Governor Brown campaign which starts Friday and aims to educate students regarding the “financial irresponsibility within the UC system stemming from Governor Brown’s plans for higher education.” The campaign mainly focuses on his plans for expediting graduation and expanding online education.</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the irresponsible use of information by the governor’s office is “disconcerting” to the A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>“The governor’s office has desired to increase summer sessions as a way to expedite graduation rates,” Guthy said. “But they weren’t aware that Pell grants and other aids don’t cover summer sessions. And summer sessions are usually more expensive because they are paid by units.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said she is concerned about the lack of a long-range budget planning for the UC system which is aggravated by Brown’s endeavor to make budget allocations on a short-term basis.</p>\n<p>“They acknowledged that they did not have long term vision when they were planning the budget,” Guthy said. “When you’re conceding that you don’t have long term vision when you’re funding a major institution like University of California, it’s seriously problematic.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the governor is cutting funds from the wrong places, and she disagrees with the suggested changes.</p>\n<p>“The governor is being insistent on trimming the fat of the UC,” Guthy said. “Unfortunately, it seems like the ‘fat’ he is trying to trim is the student resources and services that we get. I would characterize it as trying to industrialize the student experience. Moving it [education] online and making it faster doesn’t make it better.”</p>\n<p>Guthy discussed the halted plans for redesigning the A.S. main entrance, saying A.S. would seek funding from alternative sources for the proposed new entrance from campus to the A.S. main office due to its predicted cost amounting to $10,000 as opposed to the projected $5,000.</p>\n<p>“My plan is to go to the UCen Governance Board and talk with them about potentially contributing to the design and funding, if that’s something we’re still interested in pursuing,” Guthy said, “because there is a renovation fund for the UCen, so I’m curious to see if they would be willing to contribute to that project.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk spoke to the Senate about Deltopia’s success and the upcoming planning for next year’s event to ensure continued success of the event. Schunk said he is currently recruiting participants from the Office of Student Life in order to get involvement from a diverse pool of students.</p>\n<p>“This coming week we are going to be having what I am calling ‘Del-scussion,’” Schunk said. “It’s going to be an opportunity for everyone to get together and have a dialogue about what they liked about this Deltopia and what they really didn’t like.”</p>\n<p>Schunk discussed updates on district boundary bill AB 3, saying consensus had been reached on taxation powers. Schunk also said funding was coming from the Fund for Santa Barbara, The Santa Barbara Foundation, Santa Barbara County, the university and Assemblymember Das Williams’ office.</p>\n<p>“Were still working on deciding on board structure and actual boundaries of the district,” said Schunk. “The issue is not so much where is the money coming from anymore. It’s who’s the financial host going to be.”</p>\n<p>Schunk also discussed a tentative plan for Greek organizations within I.V., suggesting a series of Greek workshops centered around educating Greek life on their responsibility to the campus and I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“Part of the goal there is to empower Greek students and make them feel as if they can be stewards of this community,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>The senators also voiced different opinions on whether UCSB Extension students who do not pay A.S. fees should be able to attend student-only events like Extravaganza.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said extension students should be allowed to attend with additional fees.</p>\n<p>“They could be allowed to attend, but they would have to pay,” Lau said. “So for example, The Warm-Up was five dollars for us, but Extension students would pay way more than that.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology and feminist study double major Daisy Fernandez said allowing extension students into campus events could open the door for too many non-affiliated students.</p>\n<p>“Program Board does not like this idea at all because this opens the door to other people, like SBCC students or members of the public saying, ‘Hey they get to buy tickets, why don’t we get to buy tickets?’” Fernandez said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Perennial top-tier teams such as USC and LMU were also in the mix of college teams recruiting him, as well as many professional scouts.</p>\n<p>After graduating Bishop Amat High School in La Puente, Calif., the Baltimore Orioles drafted Young in the 25th round of the 1994 draft, yet he chose to enroll at UCSB on an athletic scholarship instead.</p>\n<p>Young struggled his freshman season with a .239 batting average and was forced to switch defensive positions when he first arrived at UCSB. Brontsema and the Gaucho coaching staff succeeded in transforming a high school outfielder into a first-team, All-Big West shortstop and third baseman throughout the three years Young was a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“The defensive switch was an important move, and the right move for his career,” Brontsema said.</p>\n<p>Young would eventually prove Brontsema’s tactics to be of value, as he went on to win the Golden Glove award for one of the best defensive players in the MLB while playing shortstop for the Rangers.</p>\n<p>“It was a great accomplishment for him,” Brontsema said. “The award is a testament to his work ethic and drive.”</p>\n<p>Young will use what he learned during his time walking the fields of Caesar Uyesaka stadium today, at AT&amp;T park as a Texas Ranger. First pitch is set for 5 p.m. from San Francisco.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28294\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/alumnus-starting-world-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28294\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/alumnus-starting-world-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/alumnus-starting-world-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/alumnus-starting-world-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-27/alumnus-starting-world-series/","id":2844,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[2843,2842,2841],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Author Lectures on Social Pressure of Technology","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3152-1.jpg?resize=306%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3152-1.jpg?resize=306%2C306&ssl=1","description":"Writer and fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture at the University of Virginia Matthew B.

Crawford gave a lecture on modern technology and the mind Tuesday night in Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>Hosted by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, Crawford’s talk, “The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming an Individual in an Age of Distraction,” discussed a phenomenon called the “crisis of attention,” which explores the distractive capabilities of modern day technology and reliance on social media for purposes of comfort and confidence. Crawford’s goal is to convince individuals, particularly youth, to be more aware of their surroundings and less consumed by technological distractions such as television and cellular devices.</p>\n<p>According to Crawford, societal pressures exist that encourage people to stay up-to-date with trends and popular entertainment as opposed to such topics such as classic literature. Crawford said engrossment with modern technology has been “normalized.”</p>\n<p>“I’d be sitting down on my comfortable couch about to read Plato and rediscover my love for complex philosophy,” Crawford said. “I would read a few pages, realize that my favorite TV show is on, so I switch on the TV and now I’m not a societal freak and can talk to some people about it. If I just read Plato and tried to talk to someone about the next day, they’d think I was a bit of a freak.”</p>\n<p>Crawford said ‘”distractibility” is facilitated by technology and provides a colorful, attractive world as opposed to a dull world without the distractions.</p>\n<p>“The more we delve into these distractions, whether it be Facebook or Candy Crush or whatnot, we start to view the normal world as more bland and tasteless,” Crawford said. “It doesn’t offer the same amount of fun and entertainment that your marshmallow treat phone application has. So then we get hungry for it, and we go running back to our phones.”</p>\n<p>Crawford also said self-esteem and sense of worth is tied to the attention users of social media get on social media sites.</p>\n<p>“To be distracted is to be entertained and awed by all these fake experiences,” Crawford said. “Our self-dignity depends on social media which then creates a fragile self, which makes us dependent on constructed experiences to make up for it.”</p>\n<p>Goleta resident Michael Jung said as a teacher he often encountered students who were unable to detach themselves from technology and relied on phone applications to solve problems.</p>\n<p>“I taught high school [trigonometry] and I just couldn’t believe how many kids would just sit and play on their phones if I left them alone,” Jung said. “One girl even asked why we need to learn math if there’s ‘an app for that.’ To be educated, that’s why!”</p>\n<p>Jung also said he found it refreshing to see young people take interest in activities and experiences other than technology.</p>\n<p>“When I see people actually take an interest in other things — traditional art, music, dancing — I feel better,” Jung said. “I know technology hasn’t consumed every part of their life.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident Margaret Rhiner said she believes youth need to be reminded to enjoy their physical environment and interact with people around them.</p>\n<p>“They don’t realize it anymore, or maybe they’re just numb to their surroundings,” Rhiner said. “I go to the beach and I’m baffled to see all these kids on their phones instead of admiring the water or playing in the sand. Young people don’t talk to people anymore and they’re all obsessed about the next big invention.”</p>\n<p>Crawford said students should take advantage of campus and its surrounding scenery while they still have the opportunity.</p>\n<p>“If you’re a UCSB student, you’re living on the edge of the Pacific Ocean,” Crawford said. “You will never, ever, live anyplace like this again. I mean, unless you’re a billionaire or something. I think of a 20-year-old walking on the beach with his head stuck in Facebook and it just breaks my heart. Live a little. It’s worth it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62134\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62134\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-08/author-lectures-on-social-pressure-of-technology/","id":2845,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2844,2843,2842],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Year in Women’s Prison, A Night at Pollock Theater","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Carsey-Wolf Center presented a special screening of the Netflix television series “Orange is the New Black” (OITNB) on Wednesday night in Pollock Theater as a part of their TELEtalk series, wh...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62217\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62217\" data-attachment-id=\"62217\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/a-year-in-womens-prison-a-night-at-pollock-theater/oitnb_photo-courtesy-of-nbclosangeles-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OITNB_Photo-Courtesy-of-NBCLosAngeles-1.jpg?fit=600%2C448&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,448\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"OITNB_Photo Courtesy of NBCLosAngeles-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OITNB_Photo-Courtesy-of-NBCLosAngeles-1.jpg?fit=250%2C187&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OITNB_Photo-Courtesy-of-NBCLosAngeles-1.jpg?fit=600%2C448&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62217\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OITNB_Photo-Courtesy-of-NBCLosAngeles-1.jpg?resize=500%2C373\" alt=\"As part of the TELEtalk series, Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black” was screened at Pollock Theater, after which Allison Anders (above) held a Q&amp;A.

After a screening of S02E06, “You Also Have a Pizza,” the director, film and media studies faculty member Allison Anders, held a Q&amp;A session ending with a reception in the lobby. The event was co-sponsored by the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity and the Department of Film and Media Studies and Davidson Library’s “UCSB Reads,” which chose Kerman’s memoir as this year’s campus-wide reading selection.</p>\n<p>When film and media studies faculty member Cynthia Felando asked Anders how she began watching the show, Anders said “OITNB” is one of the few shows she has “binge watched.”</p>\n<p>“I watched everything and I thought it was a really brilliant pilot, and of course I loved the fact that there was so many women in one show. It was amazing to me,” Anders said. “I love it that Piper was so well equipped for prison — it was just like the greatest thing to me that all of her sort of yuppified, kind of hipster stuff was not going to fly in prison. But yet it also became how she coped.”</p>\n<p>Anders said race, class and age are balanced in the series, and that the characters’ shared situation equalizes their different backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“That is the genius of Jenji Kohan, who created the show,” Anders said. “Whether it is a guard or inmate, there is a humanity there. There is a heart under that, there is a person who is struggling, and I thought that was just amazing with these characters — all of the characters, really.”</p>\n<p>Responding to an audience member’s question, Anders said she is an active feminist in the midst of the film industry’s gradual acceptance of women in the business.</p>\n<p>“I do feel like it is getting better,” Anders said. “It gets better in small increments each year. It is remarkable how far behind the industry is, and I do not understand why.”</p>\n<p>Felando said Anders, who has directed films such as “Gas Food Lodging” (1992) and “Mi Vida Loca” (1993), and episodes of “Sex in the City”, “The L Word” and “The Mentalist,” has had a full and fulfilling career.</p>\n<p>“Film and episodic television, and now streaming with Netflix,” Felando said. “It is like the gamut.”</p>\n<p>Assistant University Librarian for Outreach and Academic Collaboration Rebecca Metzger said UCSB Reads has brought people together with its screening of “OITNB”.</p>\n<p>“UCSB Reads is meant to bring the UCSB and Santa Barbara communities together to read and discuss a common book,” Metzger said in an email. “While the UCSB Library plans and hosts most of the programming, we encourage others on campus and in the community to organize their own events around the book, too.”</p>\n<p>Campus groups such as the Literature Club and the Queer Book Club have read OITNB, and the Associated Students campaign Invest in Graduation Not Incarceration, Transform Education (I.G.N.I.T.E.) hosted events focusing on the book, according to Metzger.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had faculty from the Department of Counseling, Clinical and School Psychology talking about local rehabilitation programs for inmates, and faculty from the Theater &amp; Dance Department talking about empowering incarcerated youth through theater and faculty from English and the Writing Program talking about the drama of prison narratives,” Metzger said in an email.</p>\n<p>UCSB Reads had a speaker from the university Office of Judicial Affairs talk about how the restorative justice process is applied on campus to students who violate university policy.</p>\n<p>“That discussion was attended by many students in the Teacher Education Program on campus who wanted to know how to apply restorative justice to the K-12 setting,” Metzer said.</p>\n<p>Through UCSB Reads, Metzger said restorative justice issues have been brought to a local level and made meaningful for students in their work and research.</p>\n<p>“You only have to stop by the lobby of the UCSB Library to view our exhibition of photographs of girls in the juvenile justice system by Art Professor Richard Ross and read the comment book to understand the impact of these issues to our students and community,” Metzger said in an email. “There are students here who have been in juvenile facilities, or whose parents or other family members have been in or are in prison.”</p>\n<p>The last UCSB Reads event on Orange is the New Black will be Wednesday, April 15 at 8 p.m. when Orange is the New Black author Piper Kerman will deliver a free, public talk titled “The Real Story Behind ‘Orange Is the New Black’” at Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
