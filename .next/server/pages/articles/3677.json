Comprised of business proposals and neighborhood compatibility ratings, the merit-based application is how Santa Barbara County plans to license its most qualified applicants, according to Gina Fischer, a representative from the 3rd District office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Fischer, the board of supervisors had originally planned to open a recreational dispensary application process in July 2o19 under a lottery system. But at an I.V. Community Network meeting in July, residents questioned the lottery system’s effectiveness; raffling away a license, Fischer said, opens the door to “a huge amount” of speculation about a retailer’s intentions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facing concern from her constituents, 3rd District Supervisor Joan Hartmann proposed a merit-based application in lieu of the county’s lottery system at the Board of Supervisors’ August meeting, Fischer said. There, the board voted 4 to 1 in favor of the new application.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One advantage of the merit-based application, which has already seen success in the cities of </span><a href=\"https://www.santabarbaraca.gov/business/license/cannabis/past_permit_solicitations.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.chulavistaca.gov/home/showdocument?id=18432\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chula Vista</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is that it spells out what the lottery system couldn’t: a way in which applicants can demonstrate in their applications that the needs of the community are a priority, Fischer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What do they do for the community? Are they a local business? Do they source locally?” Fischer asked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applicants answer those questions in the form of a “community benefits package,” a portion of the application where prospective retailers showcase their community outreach and detail how their business operations would be tailored to the needs of residents, she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The merit-based application will be scored in two parts. First, an independent third party contractor and “select county staff” will review and score each application, Fischer said; then in a second phase, county staff members will review each application for neighborhood compatibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The two scores will be combined for a rank-ordering. The highest ranked application in each area will have 90 days to complete its business license application,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county will then award one license to the top applicant in each of the county’s six “community plan areas”: Orcutt, Los Alamos, Santa Ynez, Eastern Goleta Valley, Isla Vista and a combined Summerland and Toro Canyon, according to the ordinance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each “community plan area” is appropriately zoned for a recreational cannabis storefront and takes “sensitive receptor areas,” such as schools, day cares and youth centers, into consideration through a 750-foot “zoning buffer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has a day care on campus. So the 750-foot boundary starts at the end of the light tunnel on Pardall and you would measure 750 feet [from there]. So any commercial zone and any commercial space within that buffer would be ineligible,” Fischer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the zoning buffer, another stipulation is that applicants must either own the unit they plan to turn into a storefront or have “written authorization from the owner to operate a cannabis operation at the site,” the ordinance read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because cannabis is still federally outlawed, applicants cannot partner with a business owner who is using a federally-backed bank lender for their commercial property. For the few units in I.V. that fall within the county’s commercial cannabis zone and are owned outright, Fischer said applicants were “promising [those property owners] the moon.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would bet my year’s salary that, within the zone that’s eligible, everybody who owns a commercial property has been approached by one dispensary or another, whether they’re local or far away,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the neighborhood compatibility scores are contingent on the county’s six neighborhood meetings, which were originally scheduled to take place through April and May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In light of social distancing restrictions, however, those meetings are postponed. And without them, the licensing process “cannot begin until the community meetings are completed,” said Barney Melekian, Assistant County executive officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We pulled the item from the Board agenda and won’t bring it back until we can provide an updated timeline,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jonathan Abboud, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) general manager, the I.V. CSD is focused on facilitating “the best possible public participation and figuring out what the community benefit should be from the dispensary” in I.V., such as donating to a local nonprofit. Beyond that, however, the I.V. CSD has been relatively uninvolved with the process, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The window for applicants to apply for a license will last one week and was originally slated to open sometime this July. But the timeline, including the application submission, review and scoring periods, will be delayed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Fischer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But far ahead of the scheduled deadlines, some recreational cannabis shops have their eye on the gold mine of Isla Vista, where the most successful applicant would have direct access to one of California’s </span><a href=\"http://www.usa.com/rank/california-state--population-density--city-rank.htm?hl=Isla+Vista&amp;hlst=CA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most densely populated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> areas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One applicant, </span><a href=\"https://www.coastaldispensary.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coastal Dispensary</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the City of Santa Barbara’s </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/09/21/coastal-cannabis-dispensary-opens-on-chapala/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> licensed storefront, has already held several meetings in Isla Vista to gauge the community’s atmosphere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Devon Wardlow, director of Public Affairs, and Myles Peck, director of Business Development, Coastal Dispensary is looking to its success as the City of Santa Barbara’s </span><a href=\"https://www.santabarbaraca.gov/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=213149\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highest-scoring</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> applicant as a model for its application to the county. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are 100% invested in Isla Vista. Given that the CEO and the majority of our executive team all went to UCSB, this is a huge opportunity. And on a personal level, it really matters to us,” Wardlow said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cookies, a San Francisco-based dispensary that also expressed interest in having a storefront in I.V., did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In compliance with the ordinance, Coastal Dispensary has locked in an I.V. property that falls within the county’s commercial cannabis zone – located next to Buddha Bowls. Peck estimates that the roughly 4,000 square-foot storefront will staff about 20 employees and will run from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of aesthetics, Peck said that the I.V. storefront’s design would follow that of its predecessors and will feature an atmosphere that is “bright,” “open” and “clean.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the design is more than just aesthetics, Wardlow said. It also breaks down the idea that “‘Hey, this is a pot shop,’ to ‘this is a legitimate big-time business that is contributing to the economy in California across the board and to the local economy,’” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow maintained that Coastal Dispensary’s connection to the I.V. community is what sets their application apart from others. To bolster Coastal Dispensary’s “community benefits package,” Wardlow said she is enlisting the help of prominent community members, such as I.V. Food Co-op general manager Melissa Cohen and I.V. Foot Patrol Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Down the line, Wardlow added that she plans to partner with another five to seven community members from “different facets of Isla Vista” to gain additional input for the benefits package.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, Coastal Dispensary has held two different informational sessions in I.V., most recently in  </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-26/cannabis-professionals-search-for-community-opinions-on-possible-isla-vista-dispensary/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">February</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There, the dispensary fielded questions and concerns from residents about the prospect of a recreational cannabis storefront in town.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community benefits aside, Peck also said that the dispensary is working on a way in which it can tailor its products to the demographics of I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will cater our menu,” he said. “So for a student who is looking for a $2 or $1 joint, we’re going to carry more of that. A lot of stuff that will cater to what the college kids need will be in terms of budget and pricing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of price point, Wardlow maintained that every Coastal Dispensary product is sourced from regional growers within the state. But the allure of budget-friendly cannabis and lab-tested products may not be enough to entice students — who commonly purchase cannabis through unregulated means — to visit the store, Peck said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re going to be fighting that for a while,” he remarked. “Once you get experience with going in and buying stuff at a real shop — it’s convenient and it’s fast and it’s quick and it’s safe — you’re going to like it. That does start to drive home with the customer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Wardlow said Coastal Dispensary would carry over its cross marketing campaigns with neighborhood businesses, loyalty programs and discounts to the new store, all of which would be “more robust in I.V.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If their application is chosen, Wardlow said that Coastal Cares, the company’s employee community service program, would be “tailored specifically” to issues that are pertinent to the I.V. community, such as basic needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a contract with the City of Santa Barbara, the dispensary agreed to donate 2% of its profits back to the community; though a work-in-progress, Wardlow said she hopes to include something similar in her community benefits proposal to the county. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You haven’t seen something like this where a brand new industry has the potential for massive economic changes for the state,” Wardlow said. “And I think that’s really exciting to be an operator in this situation because how we work is going to determine how successful this is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to keep Santa Barbara as the gold standard of retail cannabis.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

university’s Slavic studies, geology and military science librarian. In addition to her duties as a librarian, she studies vexillology, the study of flags and their historical and symbolic significance.</p>\n<p>Platoff’s interest in flags began as a childhood obsession. As a young girl, she recalled collecting flag patches and recruiting friends and family to help her gather them.</p>\n<p>Today, she has a collection of over 3,000 flags and is the leading North American expert on National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) flags and regional flags of Russia and the former Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>Platoff says flags are very symbolic and emotion-filled objects that can represent different ideals for different groups. She said an understanding of the connection between emotions and politics could help people understand the take-a-knee movement.</p>\n<p>“To some people, the take-a-knee movement is about the flag,” she said. “There is so much emotion tied up in them that people read them different ways depending on their personal background and history.”</p>\n<p>The take-a-knee movement began when 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick remained sitting during the National Anthem at a football game in August 2016, which since then sparked different football players to kneel during the anthem.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t understand the perspective of African Americans … or perhaps other groups that do not enjoy equal treatment under the law, you would see it as an affront to the flag,” Platoff said. “But if you look from their perspective, you can understand why the take-a-knee movement has taken off.”</p>\n<p>Platoff believes she has the best flag collection in North American relating to NASA, as well as flags made in Russia or the Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>Through her vexillology research, Platoff has found connections between the United States and Russia through both countries’ experiences with nationalist groups. She says flags are oftentimes controversial symbols because they can be interpreted differently depending on an individual’s personal history.</p>\n<p>Platoff said a new nationalist group in Ukraine uses the flag of the old Ukrainian Insurgent Army, a former nationalist group from World War II which fought both with and against the Nazis, as the symbolic representation of their group. Ukraine has a mix of Ukrainian and Russian culture.</p>\n<p>“When a Ukrainian sees this flag, they see it as a Ukrainian national symbol,” she said. “But when a Russian sees that flag, they think it’s a fascist symbol.”</p>\n<p>She compares this situation with the United States’ struggle surrounding the Confederate flag in the United States.</p>\n<p>“When you see the Confederate flag you may think it’s a racist symbol, but someone from the South will see it as a symbol of their Southern heritage,” Platoff said.</p>\n<p>Platoff developed her flag expertise when she worked as a librarian at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where she became interested in different NASA flags. Within her current collection, Platoff has flags that have flown on Gemini and Apollo space missions.</p>\n<p>Platoff’s work with NASA’s flags also extends past her collection, as she wrote the official NASA history of the flag used in the Apollo XI mission, as well as a paper for the University of California negating moon landing conspiracies.</p>\n<p>She explained that conspiracy theorists were examining the wrinkles of a flag on the moon, which appeared to be blowing in the wind — impossible in a place with zero gravity. She refuted their claims by noting that the flag was created with two rods running perpendicular to the vertical pole, allowing for the illusion of movement.</p>\n<p>Platoff has also held many positions within North American Vexillological Association (NAVA), serving as the first and second vice president, and is now the director of NAVA’s digital library.</p>\n<p>Platoff says she is most proud of the publication of her first published work on flags in NASA, “Where No Flag Has Gone Before: Political and Technical Aspects of Placing a Flag on the Moon.” The paper won the prestigious Captain William Driver Award, which is presented at NAVA’s annual conference.</p>\n<p>“No one had really written anything about the political aspects in deciding to put a flag on the moon and the technical engineering problems associated with it,” she said. “This was the first work to sort of look at those together.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Platoff believes she has the best NASA, Russian and Soviet Union flag collection in North America, not the best North American flag collection.  </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 26, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
