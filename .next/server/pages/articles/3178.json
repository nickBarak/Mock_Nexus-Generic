id=\"caption-attachment-86227\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vargas discussed several topics, most notably the concept of “home.” <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Margaret Klawunn, the vice chancellor for UC Santa Barbara’s Student Affairs, spoke briefly before the lecture, explaining that its purpose was to zero in on the diversity of undocumented people not often represented in the media.</p>\n<p>Professor Lisa Sun-Hee Park, chair of the department of Asian-American Studies at UCSB, introduced Vargas by highlighting the significance of his lecture.</p>\n<p>“Almost thirty 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we have made borders and walls essential fixture[s] of our national identity,” Park said.</p>\n<p>“It is an ineffectual shortcut and unimaginative copout from dealing with the realities of a global world.”</p>\n<p>Vargas’ appearance comes at a time when the nation approaches the possibility of another government shutdown over funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall.</p>\n<p>Vargas referenced this topic in his opening.</p>\n<p>“It’s really a privilege to be here tonight, considering the government may shut down again in the next couple of days, because we can’t seem to want to talk about immigration without talking about walls,” he said as he began his remarks to the crowd.</p>\n<p>The theme of the night’s lecture was “home.” Vargas used his allotted time to attempt to tease out the contradictions in how “home” is conceptualized as an undocumented immigrant.</p>\n<p>Vargas started the discussion by bringing up a seemingly trivial Bank of America email he received about his readiness to purchase a home.</p>\n<p>“I saw this email on my iPhone, and the subject line is, ‘Ready to buy a home?,’ and Trump had just gotten elected President,” he said. “At that point I heard from at least 30 undocumented people of all ages who are considering leaving the country.”</p>\n<p>Vargas said he had seriously considered leaving the United States for Canada, citing the prevalence of Filipinos in Toronto and the famous film festival named after the city.</p>\n<p>Then he received a letter from the chief of staff for Nancy Pelosi, current Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, inviting him to attend Trump’s first State of the Union as her guest.</p>\n<p>He spoke about his decision to publish an essay for the <i>Washington Post </i>jointly with his attendance, saying he felt it was risky considering Trump’s attitude toward immigrants, legal or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Vargas puts his contention to those opposed to his existence plainly, sharing the opening line of his previously published essay with the audience: “This is my country, too.”</p>\n<p>Vargas read aloud a passage from his essay explaining why he felt compelled to attend the State of the Union despite earlier considering relocating to Canada.</p>\n<p>“I decided to show up tonight [at the first State of the Union address] because that’s what immigrants, undocumented and documented, do: We show up. Despite the obvious risks and palpable fear we show up to work, to school, to church, to our communities, in big cities and rural towns.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86226\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86226\" data-attachment-id=\"86226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/activist-jose-vargas-comes-to-campbell-hall-discusses-experiences-as-an-undocumented-immigrant/immigration_riley-esguerra_online-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=2000%2C1405&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Immigration_Riley Esguerra_ONLINE-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=888%2C624&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86226\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=888%2C624\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86226\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Vargas stressed the importance the immigration explosion presents historically, soberly noting the inability of “native-born” Americans to have this pressing conversation surrounding undocumented immigration.</p>\n<p>“This country can barely have a conversation about [the] Black Lives Matter Movement without having a panic attack. This country can’t even talk about Native Americans with any sort of nuance and any sort of import,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we’re going to expect that this country can talk about 43 million people? It’s not a surprise that we are where we are.”</p>\n<p>Around 30 minutes into his lecture, Vargas addressed the central, basic question regarding immigration, legal or not: “Why do people move?”</p>\n<p>Vargas delved into issues with U.S. foreign policy, particularly that of imperialism and colonialism, regarding his home nation of the Philippines. He referenced a conservative Tea Party event in North Carolina that he attended, where he said his response to a condescending question about Filipinos presence in the U.S. was, “Sir, <i>we are here</i> because <i>you were there</i>.”</p>\n<p>Vargas also called attention to the different ways that mass movements of people are framed.</p>\n<p>“Why is it that when white people move it’s called courageous, necessary … Manifest Destiny [and] White Man’s Burden. Yet when people of color move, what’s the question? Is it legal? Is it a crime? Will they assimilate? When will it stop?”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of his talk, Vargas revisited his recent book and the process behind it, detailing how the separation of the book into the themes of lying, passing and hiding came about.</p>\n<p>“My editor did something that was really horrific. She said, ‘I want you to go home for the holidays and I want you to list the Top 20 most painful experiences of your life,’” Vargas said.</p>\n<p>“I listed 22. When I broke them out everything had to do with either lying, passing and hiding.”</p>\n<p>For Vargas, filling out an employment form for the San Francisco Chronicle was an especially poignant moment. At the time, Vargas was not a lawful permanent resident nor did he agree with the categorization of himself as an “alien.”</p>\n<p>Marking himself as a citizen would constitute perjury, as a sentence on the application reminded him. Despite this, he checked himself off as a citizen.</p>\n<p>“There was nothing else to check so I checked citizen, and whenever I checked it I actually convinced myself I was gonna go earn [citizenship].</p>\n<p>Vargas was told later by a lawyer this past offense — a false claim to citizenship — may be the reason he never becomes a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p>Even worse, he said he was ‘hiding’ from his mother, not having seen her in 25 years. She herself has been waiting for 16 years to come in the legal way from the Philippines.</p>\n<p>Vargas closed the speech by asking the audience to raise their hands if they were U.S. citizens. He implored those with their hands raised not to take their citizenship for granted.</p>\n<p>“We have a human right to move because migration is natural, and governments, including this one, should not limit those rights,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Home is actually not something I should have to earn.”</p>\n<p><em>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 14, 2019 of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.

Mingo provided suggestions for specific books and advised Jackson to consider a variety of genres and perspectives and to find books for the pop-up that represent each. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I drew from books on my personal bookshelf, books I would want my students to read but we do not have space for them on the syllabus, books that are great introductions to nontraditional fields, books that can easily make must-read lists, and more,” Mingo said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Solomon and Amingo hope this year’s pop-up will be the beginning of a project that will resurface on campus in following years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope this will be the start of an annual opportunity for students to select books that they may not be familiar with, join in dialogue with others who also  select the same books, and extend their education beyond the classroom,” Mingo said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Solomon, the idea behind the pop-up goes back to one of the fundamental underpinnings of the university: the value of diversity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The whole purpose of being at a university this large and the whole purpose of diversity… [is that] people to learn something that might not have to do with their own understanding of life and like experience.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins led the Los Angeles and New Haven chapters of the Black Panther Party for 14 years after she originally joined in 1968, </span><a href=\"https://www.erickahuggins.com/bio\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to her website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Black Panther Party was a </span><a href=\"https://www.freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/Black%20Liberation%20Disk/Black%20Power!/SugahData/Books/Cleaver.S.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seeking the liberation of all oppressed peoples by toppling capitalism, according to their former Minister of Information, Eldridge Cleaver.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Black Panther Party was known for its radical approach to organizing and meeting the material needs of Black and other oppressed groups with free breakfast and groceries programs, free clinics, political education and armed protection from police abuse according to </span><a href=\"https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/longmoreinstitute/bundles/230640\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">former chairwoman of the Party Elaine Brown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexandra Gessesse, UCSB’s Black Student Union financial director, introduced Huggins that night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ericka Huggins taught herself to meditate as a means to survive incarceration … since then she incorporated spiritual practice into her community work and as a speaker and facilitator, teaching it as a tool for change,” Gessesse said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins started off her lecture on the topic of having an “attitude of gratitude,” which over the years helped ease the pain of incarceration and being subjected to solitary confinement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you feel like a speck of pepper in a sea of rice, remember gratitude,” Huggins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also served as her first of many motions for audience participation, asking those in attendance to reflect briefly on someone or something they are grateful for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins prefaced her later remarks on identity, activism and change by describing what it means to be aware of humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most all the isms — sexism, racism [and] classism — all of them are really not based in hatred. They look like they’re hateful, but they’re based in fear. Which is an irrational emotion for any of us to have.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins further posited that said “isms” aren’t to be attributed to individuals but to the institutions that manufacture and reproduce them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s structural … Remember that no one man or woman or group of men and women is responsible. It was here before they got here and before the ones before them,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins then segued into identity from these statements, pointing out the significance of coinciding identities existing in one body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if we say my identity is human, which it is for all of us, there are other identities folded in … all in this one body,” Huggins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you are a man and a gay man, those are coinciding identities. If you are a man and you are heterosexual, [those are] coinciding identities. When the two men meet there could be some learning there … if our socialization didn’t get in the way of the two men talking, and that socialization teaches us to be fearful of what we don’t know.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins transitioned into discussing activism, first by explaining what it meant to embody the essence of activism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Activism is what you do, how you participate in creating the transformation you want to see in this world. In other words it’s the dues you pay for taking up space on the planet.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is not a monolithic thing … [but] it needs to be a little bit beyond Facebook, okay,” said Huggins, joking with the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins, in between her humor, didn’t leave out the somber reality that can accompany activism, particularly of people like herself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe you think that an activist has to live the kind of life that I lived. You don’t want my life. I assure you. It’s not romantic. It’s not pretty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins spoke about change and transformation, noting her time in Upstate New York, learning from children who were researching the life cycle of a butterfly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t just change. They transform,” Huggins said a boy exclaimed to her at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins connected this anecdote to her and the Black Panther Party’s struggle for a transformation of society beyond the previous change achieved in the 1960s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A change would be civil rights, which are the rights you are due by law … human rights, if they’re honored, would be the rights you are due by your very birth. That is transformation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins laced the concepts of identity, activism and change together by advising the audience to step outside of the boxes built up around them and rejecting those imposed upon others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whatever you were told about yourself and about others, if it doesn’t hold them up as fully human, you can let go of it … The universe won’t dissolve into the cosmos if we let go of some old, tired, whatever it is, but it’s important that we begin because freedom, is an inside job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few students after the lecture offered their thoughts on which passages resonated most with them, and discussed the connection to the current political climate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish the talk was longer because every time I thought I knew something, her views on life told me different,” Aryn Jackson, a third-year communication major said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson related to Huggins’ belief that no one identity can fully explain the qualities of a person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nashelle Brown, a third-year film and media studies major, related the lecture to political polarization in the U.S. She pointed out that immense tension can impede change as well as the transformation that Huggins defined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s favorite quote encapsulates Huggins’ lasting message of the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“None of these privileges are anyone’s fault; it’s how we use it.”</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus<i>.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.

Director Jeanne Stanford.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Merchant, the demands played an integral role in her decision to work at UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was inspired by the agency and activism of students to ask for what they need and to use their voices and resources to get their needs met.  I would not have left LA … if it had not been for the opportunity to respond to the call of Black students who were feeling unsupported, underrepresented, and invisible,” Merchant said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant, who grew up in Los Angeles but spent “15 summers in a row in Chicago where my parents were born,” said her parents moved to California to provide her with more opportunities than they believed she would have in Chicago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They instilled pride in being Black, demanded that I speak up for myself, and regularly told me that I could do anything that I put my mind to,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming a psychologist was a natural choice for Merchant, who said she has always been the person that friends confided in and looked to for advice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I chose to go to graduate school with the thought, ‘Everyone tells me their deepest darkest secrets and talks to be about anything, why not get paid to be me?’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant’s areas of focus are women’s health, academic success, overall student wellness and “empowering and supporting students who may feel marginalized and specifically students from the African Diaspora,” according to the C.A.P.S. website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have always worked in settings in which I advocated for underrepresented populations and helped give voice to the voiceless,” Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant cited her own personal experiences as the reason she cares so much about helping others find solutions to their problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My personal reproductive trauma, having a daughter (Nailah Asha) that died the day before her first birthday in 2006, led to me learning the statistic that Black college educated women are twice as likely to have an infant die than a white woman who drops of out high school,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My loss and this data, fueled my passion for being part of the solution that reduces levels of stress of people who look like me (and anyone else I come in contact with) because too many babies and mothers are dying unnecessarily due to the structural and institutional racism across the life span, lived and passed on through generations, and it needs to stop.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant hopes to help Black students find peace and a sense of belonging and safety through counseling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At predominantly white serving institutions, more often than not, many students of color, and especially Black students find themselves fighting against being treated as inferior and as if they don’t belong before they even step into a classroom,” she wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students of color, particularly Black students, may not feel as comfortable asking for help as others for a variety of reasons, Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes it’s a lack of trust in institutions, but there are also cultural stigmas for students of color who might be shamed for talking about their family’s private business or who worry about being called crazy, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is much easier to seek help if one feels as if someone understands their struggle and reduces the burden that students have felt to teach the counselor about the struggle to be Black at a white serving institution before they can get the help they need.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her time so far at UCSB, Merchant’s proudest accomplishment is establishing for Black students that she is there to support them and that she truly sees them. Since her and Barfield’s time at UCSB, Black students have utilized C.A.P.S. in larger numbers, Merchant said, and lately the program has been working to reach out to students more as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as she works to support Black students on campus, Merchant faces her own struggle on a predominantly white campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It has been lonely and overwhelming as the only Black female psychologist in CAPS,” she said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being a Black staff member at UCSB mirrors the Black student experience in many ways and having community is essential and important for me too” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BSU Demands Team recently released a set of demands in early February, addressing the need for more Black student advocacy on campus, both institutionally and one-on-one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant believes the completion of these demands, particularly the construction of a building named the “Malcolm X Center for Black Student Development,” would increase Black student retention and graduation in a significant way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that it would be very supportive, empowering, and meaningful for Black students to have a place that they can call their own, where they feel a sense of belonging, and are encouraged, in word and action, to be their best selves.  Where they are guaranteed to see people who look like them and to trust that their needs are important and their existence is validated,” she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand for a freestanding building for Black students was one written into the first demands released in 1968. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all need to take more responsibility for our role in improving the mental health of all students.  This is not just the responsibility of psychologists in the counseling center but it is everyone’s responsibility,” Merchant wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“However, with respect to Black students who I believe make up the second smallest ethnic group on campus, greater efforts need to be made to create, sustain, and enrich the experiences and environment for Black students,” Merchant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are people working independently on initiatives to improve Black student admission, retention and graduation rates, Merchant believes that centralizing those operations is key to being accessible to Black students who need help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also believes that while Student Affairs has prioritized diversity, inclusion and equity, individual professors and academic departments need to be held accountable for creating classrooms where Black students are not made to feel out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many Black students and other students of marginalized populations enter classrooms on the defense due to how they are treated by classmates as well as professors,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many professors are not held accountable for their complicit behavior and students suffer.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [11:12 a.m.]:<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Merchant’s first name is Meridith, not Meredith. This mistake was due to an editing error and has been corrected. </span></em></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus<i>.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
