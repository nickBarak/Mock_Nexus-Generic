Foot Patrol officers apprehended a suspect — dressed, painted and hair-sprayed entirely green — on suspicion of public intoxication and disorderly conduct shortly after midnight on Nov. 1.</p>\n<p>After the jolly green reveler noticed that he had caught the attention of local authorities, he strolled into oncoming traffic in opposition to officers’ requests that he accompany them to the curb for a sobriety test and narrowly avoided being struck by a westbound vehicle. The emerald escapist then fled on foot up Del Playa Drive, promptly colliding with a stop sign on the corner of Camino Pescadero.</p>\n<p>However, the Green Lantern never gives up without a fight and, in a superhuman feat of agility, remained upright and continued his flight with several deputies in pursuit.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the hope that his green face paint and hair coloring would serve as better camouflage off the street, the fleet-footed suspect sought refuge in a nearby residence on DP. As the cops followed him into the house, he made a ninja turtle-worthy leap over the back fence into another nearby residence.</p>\n<p>Following the indignant cries of the Del Playa residents — none of whom wished to press trespassing charges — officers eventually apprehended the mischievous leprechaun inside a third DP residence.</p>\n<p>Upon his arrest, the captured fugitive articulated that he wanted to provide deputies with a formal statement. However, after the suspect was transferred to the I.V. Foot Patrol station for processing, his remarks were found to be incoherent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42775\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42775\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-10/police-blotter-75/","id":3818,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3817,3816,3815],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie","biography":"Not available","articles":[3135,3510,3513,3519,3808,3817,3818],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Deputies were on patrol on the 6500 block of Del Playa Rd. in the wee hours of the morning when they noticed a lone lady stumbling down the street.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Stupid is as stupid (and Bacardi) does…</strong></p>\n<p>Saturday, Feb. 19 —</p>\n<p>Deputies were on patrol on the 6500 block of Del Playa Rd. in the wee hours of the morning when they noticed a lone lady stumbling down the street.<br>\nThe concerned cops asked if the woman knew where she was going, and she assured them that she was going to turn right and continue walking two blocks — which the cops couldn’t help but point out would lead her straight into the ocean.<br>\nThe sassy chick sloppily snickered, admitted she had four cocktails, some of which mayyyyybe had Bacardi in them.<br>\nWhen officers learned that the drunken damsel in distress was without a cell phone, a benevolent copper offered to help her call a friend.

The man responded three times with the same string of numbers and no street address. When asked how much he had to drink, he responded he had 16 shots that night, which he said was more than he typically consumes.<br>\nEventually, the officers also had to ask where his pants were. The Undie King had no idea, but said he was a tad cold.<br>\nOfficers arrested the man and transported him to Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, sans pants, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34638\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34638\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/","id":3815,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3814,3813,3812],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"During a nightly stroll through Camino Pescadero Park on the 6500 Block of Del Playa Drive at around 11 p.m. on Friday, deputies happened upon a young female giving a golden shower to the grass — an...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>During a nightly stroll through Camino Pescadero Park on the 6500 Block of Del Playa Drive at around 11 p.m. on Friday, deputies happened upon a young female giving a golden shower to the grass — and her hands, feet and legs — against the fence of the park.</p>\n<p>When asked for identification, the mysterious woman began handing officers trash from the bottom of her purse and then offered up her camera in the hopes her latest materials for a wittily-titled Facebook album could serve as proper photographic identification.</p>\n<p>Although she initially denied having consuming any alcoholic beverages, the sodden Swede eventually conceded she had “a few shots of liquor” as she struggled to stay upright en route to a seat on a nearby bench.</p>\n<p>The situation continued to worsen as IVFP deputies arrested her for public intoxication due to her spectacular failure at spelling her own first name (switching some Ds with Ts and missing a few crucial vowels).

Realizing her impending incarceration, the suave Swede’s optimism turned to threats against national security … and undergarments.

Summoning his inner wild side, the juiced juvenile used the bottle as his personal machete and took a determined swing at one officer. While Pineapple Skyy may be good at knocking out freshmen just graduating from wine coolers, it was significantly less effective on trained law enforcement officials; the suspect was quickly disarmed and muzzled up with a personal pair of handcuffs.</p>\n<p>Despite his constraints, the fermented-fruit-sipping fiend was not yet ready to throw in the towel. When officers discovered a glass bottle of marijuana in the boy’s pocket, he took advantage of the distraction and, having already lost the fight, went with the other instinct and scrambled down Sabado Tarde Road with his hands still cuffed. Though cuffs can often make people quicker in the bedroom, the same cannot be said for the cantering criminal, who was quickly chased down and tackled … again.</p>\n<p>The suspect ended his tropical tonic-fueled adventures along with several other primal pals in the Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42565\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42565\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/","id":3817,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3816,3815,3814],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
