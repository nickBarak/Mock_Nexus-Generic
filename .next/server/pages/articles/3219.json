After years of preparation, teams get their chance to reshape their rosters and hopefully reel in some of the league’s top talent.<br>\nRecent off-seasons have not disappointed. In 2010, we were all witnesses to the infamous “Decision,” where after months of speculation, LeBron James told the world he would be taking his talents to the Miami Heat along with Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.<br>\n2011 was hell on earth for NBA fans as a lockout extended the offseason an extra two months. Laker fans however will forever remember it as the year of the infamous David Stern veto, a decision that sent Chris Paul across the hall to the Clippers locker room instead of the Lakers.’<br>\n2012 was the year of the “Dwightmare,” when after months of flip-flopping, Dwight Howard miraculously ended up in a Laker uniform along with Steve Nash, beginning one of the most disappointing seasons in sports history.<br>\nThe 2013 offseason has already seen multiple blockbuster deals reshape the entire NBA landscape.<br>\nThe first blockbuster came from the Celtics, who shipped off Head Coach Doc Rivers to the Clippers to replace Vinny del Negro, while Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce were sent to the Brooklyn Nets to form one of the strongest starting lineups in basketball.<br>\nThe most anticipated move of the off-season came soon after, and for the second straight offseason it involved Dwight Howard.<br>\nAfter a dreadful season with the Lakers, the one they call Superman chose to leave and join James Harden and the Houston Rockets. The move will surely add to the league’s newest rivalry between the Rockets and Harden’s old team, the Oklahoma City Thunder. The two young teams are set to dominate the western conference for years to come.<br>\nGolden State made moves to acquire Andre Iguodala from the Nuggets, adding a leadership presence to another young, rising western conference team.<br>\nThe Clippers didn’t stop after acquiring their new head coach, sending away Caron Butler and glorified backup point guard Eric Bledsoe to Phoenix for Jared Dudley and JJ Redick.<br>\nCleveland wasn’t able to fulfill Dan Gilbert’s promise of winning a championship before LeBron James did, but they might be headed in the right direction after signing former Laker center Andrew Bynum. Along with Kyrie Irving, Cleveland may have the best point guard-center combination in recent years.<br>\nThere were a few surprising moves by some of this year’s high profile free agents, starting with Josh Smith, Brandon Jennings and Chauncey Billups joining the Detroit Pistons. Monta Ellis signed with the Dallas Mavericks, Al Jefferson left Utah to join the Charlotte Bobcats, and OJ Mayo joined the Milwaukee Bucks coming off his best year yet.<br>\nNew Orleans, in their first year being known as the “Pelicans,” may also be a team on the rise after acquiring guards Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans  in separate deals.<br>\nOther than the Celtics, the NBA’s glory franchises have made only small adjustments to their teams.<br>\nThe Heat have stayed basically the same, with their biggest move being the re-signing of “The Birdman” Chris Andersen.<br>\nNew York moved some pieces around to acquire center Andrea Bargnani from the Raptors, while also re-signing J.R. Smith and guard Pablo Prigioni.<br>\nThe Lakers have moved on from the Dwight Howard saga and have made small one-year signings, including guard Nick Young and center Chris Kaman. With Steve Nash being the only contract on the books for the 2014-15 season, the Lakers are positioning themselves to bring in a star like Carmelo Anthony next summer to take the torch from the great Kobe Bryant.<br>\nWith that, nearly all of the offseason’s biggest moves are likely done. Fans will now go back to counting the days until they can see their team’s newly adjusted rosters in action.<br>\nJust two more months and normalcy shall return. Heat fans will continue to enjoy dominance, Thunder fans will be hungry to get back to the finals, Laker fans will be pretentious as always and Bulls fans… Well, Bulls fans will probably continue to wait for Derrick Rose to come back. Good old NBA.</p>\n<p><em>This story is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo Courtesy of  Wikipedia.org. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51818\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/recapping-the-nba-offeseasons-biggest-storylines/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51818\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/recapping-the-nba-offeseasons-biggest-storylines/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/recapping-the-nba-offeseasons-biggest-storylines/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/recapping-the-nba-offeseasons-biggest-storylines/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/recapping-the-nba-offeseasons-biggest-storylines/","id":3219,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[3218,3217,3216],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

A positional resolution requires a two-thirds majority to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate is composed of 24 senators, not including Internal Vice President Steven Ho; as of Wednesday morning, three senators have excused themselves for the entire meeting but will be sending proxies in their places. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is a tie, Ho will be responsible for casting the tie-breaking vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution aims to divest from 13 companies: Boeing, CNH Industrial, Caterpillar, Cemex, General Dynamics, General Electric, L-3 Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Siemens, United Technologies Corporation and Valero Energy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents invested over $127 million in these companies during 2018, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the news that divestment would be happening on Wednesday, both anti- and pro- divestment groups created Facebook events aimed at getting more people to attend the meeting and express their opinions about the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/852504278434889/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anti-divestment Facebook event</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, created by Students Supporting Israel, described the resolution as an “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anti-Israel BDS resolution.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We oppose this resolution and we need your presence to demonstrate student opposition to this divisive resolution,” the Facebook description states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/408181696426375/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pro-divestment Facebook event</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, created by Students for Justice in Palestine, states that the resolution “is intended to create a critical dialogue about companies participating in human rights violations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the resolution has been largely symbolic, because while it calls upon the UC system to divest, the A.S. Senate has not had any actual power itself to divest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this year’s resolution notes that A.S. has invested $55.771.96 in DFA Emerging Markets Social Core Portfolio; $19,627.06 in PIMCO Emerging Local Bond Fund; $1,589.28 in iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF; $1,353.00 in iShares MSCI EAFE ETF; and $2,351.25 in iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If tonight’s resolution passes, these investments would stop, Off-Campus Senator Christian Ornelas confirmed.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution in full can be viewed below: </span></p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-Divestment-Resolution.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-Divestment-Resolution.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p>\n<p><em>Updated [4:33 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

I have decided that the best way to say “bye” is to say thank you to all the people who I have worked with these last couple years, so here it goes.</p>\n<p>My editors are definitely on the top of that list of people to thank, so thank you Paul-Michael and Kristen. You guys have been awesome all year. Thanks for letting me cover such great sports and for working with me over the year. Hopefully I wasn’t too much of a pain for anyone.</p>\n<p>Also, to everyone at the <i>Nexus</i> who I don’t have usual contact with but make this whole thing function: thank you so much! I wish I would have gotten to know you all so this was more meaningful, but, sincerely, thanks.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I also know I have to give a huge thank you to each and every person that I have worked with in each sport I have covered. I appreciate it each and every time you guys are willing to speak with me.</p>\n<p>This year, I was the regular sportswriter for women’s volleyball and men’s baseball and, to be honest, I was always worried if talking to me would jinx the team or player because I’m superstitious like that, so hopefully none of you are like that and hated talking to me. I also hope I never bothered anybody too much; if I did and you actually end up reading this, I’m sorry.</p>\n<p>In volleyball, I have to again say thank you to Head Coach Kathy Gregory because she made covering her team a really great experience. For anyone who has never met or talked to Kathy Gregory, you’re really missing out because she is downright awesome. So thanks, Kathy; you made me feel very comfortable each and every time I interviewed you and you really helped me out a lot and it is always appreciated.</p>\n<p>Covering baseball this year has been a blast. It is far and away my favorite sport and so getting to follow the team and create a rapport with those guys has been really cool. I’m glad their season has gone so well because it has sure made my job much easier.</p>\n<p>After one game, I spoke with Head Coach Andrew Checketts and apologized for being his third post-game interview. He assured me it was always fine to give multiple interviews after they won. As any sportswriter will tell you, it is always the best-case scenario to talk with the team after a win. I’m always sitting there hoping that the Gauchos win because it will make everyone more willing to talk about the game. I always feel weird asking people after a loss about the game; no one is happy about that, not even me, and I’m supposed to be unbiased.</p>\n<p>That being said, thanks Coach Checketts a ton for taking my calls and speaking with me post-game after wins and losses. Thankfully there were more wins this year and hopefully they keep on coming. Also, thank you to all the players I have called for previews and recaps for taking time out of your day to talk to me. I really do appreciate that.</p>\n<p>Now I feel like I need to say bye to the school in general. It’s a common saying that time flies by when you’re having fun and man, that could not be truer at this school. I’m almost sad I’m getting out of here after four years because there is just no way I will live like this again. I am afraid my life has peaked in my early 20s. What place and people are cooler than Isla Vista?</p>\n<p>To anyone that will be coming back, I am a little jealous of you and I hope you enjoy yourselves. To the sports teams, players and coaches that I have worked with, if you even read this, again thank you so much and best of luck to each and every one of you; I mean it. I am kind of bummed I won’t be here with the <i>Nexus</i> to follow the success of these teams, but I know they are going to only get better, so everyone go support! Seriously, these games are so fun and we are so good, you’ll have a good time, trust me. Also I would like to thank any of my readers. I have no idea if people follow what I do or not, but if you are out there, thanks for reading what I have to say; that’s really cool of you. Also, hi Mom! She reads my stuff online.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily

students each year. <em>Courtesy of Pamela Velazquez</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ucsbclop.com\">College Link Outreach Program</a> (C.L.O.P.) is a three-day, two-night program in which 150 underrepresented students across California are invited to the UCSB campus to explore opportunities for higher education.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. was originally created through the collaborative efforts of Hermanos Unidos, a Chicanx organization for University of California students, and Sigma Alpha Zeta, a multicultural group for women of color. The two organizations joined forces in 1999 to bring an inaugural group of 40 low-income students to the campus, according to the C.L.O.P. website.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. is an all-expense paid program that is fully funded by multiple Associated Students (A.S.) entities, including A.S Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC), Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.), Finance and Business (F&amp;B) and the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.).</p>\n<p>The program is also funded by individual donors and fundraisers, which take place throughout the entire school year.</p>\n<p>Over the past 20 years, the program has since expanded to serve 150 students each year. Students gain insight into the college experience by participating in workshops and attending mock lectures and overall gain exposure to campus resources.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. Coordinator Pamela Velazquez, a third-year sociology and Chicanx studies double major, has been involved with C.L.O.P. for the past three years.</p>\n<p>“I think our students often lack representation, so being able to see someone like you on a college campus can make a huge difference,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>“Institutions of higher education need to do a better job at reaching our students, but since it is not being done, it is up to us and programs like ours to really reach those students and impact them.”</p>\n<p>To get involved with C.L.O.P., high school students have to partake in an application process. C.L.O.P. outreach facilitators visit 20 participating high schools throughout Winter Quarter to encourage students to apply. Students then submit their field of interest, extracurriculars, community service hours and a two to three page personal statement explaining their motivations for attending college. Applications are due the March prior to the event.</p>\n<p>Several C.L.O.P. alumni have gone on to help lead the program themselves, including Entertainment Facilitator Kassandra Perez, a third-year financial math and statistics major.</p>\n<p>“My outlook has tremendously shifted now that I am part of the team because I see on a greater level how much this program is able to influence students,” Perez said in an email.</p>\n<p>“As a C.L.O.P.Per (our nickname for participants) I saw how the program impacted and helped me, but now that I am part of the team it is so rewarding to see all the students that have benefited from the program.”</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. participants are hosted by UCSB students in the Manzanita Village and San Rafael residence halls, a process that is facilitated by C.L.O.P. housing coordinators in collaboration with RHA. Participants eat in the various dining commons on campus throughout the course of the program, according to Velazquez.</p>\n<p>Participating students attend several workshops, including admissions, financial aid and A-G requirements workshops. These workshops are hosted by UCSB Admissions and Financial Aid staff, Perez said.</p>\n<p>“It is important to provide these students with this information because many of them will be first generation college students, and their parents/families may not be able to provide them with the insight they need to pursue a higher education,” Perez said in an email.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“C.L.O.P. is a way to remember that although we have made it this far and we continue to grow our experiences, a lot of students who were once like us are not.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Not having this information and not knowing what to do often discourages these students from applying to college.”</p>\n<p>Participants also attend several lifestyle workshops, including the “Gender Fishbowl,” in which they are separated into groups to discuss the difficulties that face young men and women of color. They also participate in the “Get a Life” workshop, which aims to represent the inequalities that certain social and class backgrounds face. After each workshop, facilitators lead a discussion to debrief each activity, highlighting the underlying meanings for students to take away.</p>\n<p>Several other events include an interactive chemistry demonstration and a “Know Your Rights” workshop, which teaches students how to proceed in situations that involve law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes we have students that may have difficulty when it comes to approaching police. They may have different feelings about the police in their own communities, so…we show them exactly how they should conduct themselves when approached,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. coordinators also put on a Resource Fair to highlight the opportunities that higher education has to offer. Several departments such as the Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E.) and Undocumented Student Services will be in attendance this year, in addition to the local fire and police departments, according to Velazquez.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. concludes with a barbeque on the beach and a closing ceremony, during which all teams and C.L.O.P. contributors are recognized in a closing video. For its 20th anniversary this year, C.L.O.P. will feature alumni and their experiences in the program via video submission.</p>\n<p>The program is also offering a new scholarship designed to help past C.L.O.P.Pers as they continue their journeys through higher education, another component of the program’s 20th anniversary celebration. The scholarship will involve an application process and be offered to one member of each grade.</p>\n<p>C.L.O.P. has placed an emphasis on expanding its social media presence in the past years as well, which has significantly contributed to the growth of the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m really proud of our social media so far. We have really started working with it to reach students, we know its the best way to reach them at their age,” Velasquez said.</p>\n<p>WIth social media campaigns like #CLOPWorks on the C.L.O.P. Instagram page, students are able to send in stories of how C.L.O.P. helped them and what their future plans were after attending the program, according to Velasquez.</p>\n<p>“Our students will ask questions about financial aid and classes, and that’s also the way we are able to connect to them through surveys or anything like that,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>Perez has a dynamic perspective on the impact of C.L.O.P. on the lives of students, having experienced being both a team leader and “C.L.O.P.Per” herself.</p>\n<p>“As a high schooler coming from a low-income family, I always knew I wanted to go to college, but always felt discouraged because I never thought that someone like me would be able to afford college or even be able to make it to college,” Perez said in the email.</p>\n<p>“C.L.O.P. benefited my life because prior to coming to the program, I didn’t even know what UCSB was, nor did I ever think I would ever apply here. Now I can proudly say that C.L.O.P. definitely influenced me to attend UCSB and give back to my community and students like myself.”</p>\n<p>Like Perez, Velasquez is passionate about C.L.O.P.’s impact on the lives of participants, as well as the necessity for such outreach programs on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“C.L.O.P. serves as an opportunity to inspire others and to grow as a college student as well. Sometimes college kind of takes a toll on us and we stop seeing what really matters and really caring about our communities,” Velazquez said.</p>\n<p>“C.L.O.P. is a way to remember that although we have made it this far and we continue to grow our experiences, a lot of students who were once like us are not.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
