A few road tournaments later, UCSB was looking good with an 8-4 record with all of its losses coming against top-six opponents in which the games were competitive. Santa Barbara encountered a hiccup versus San Jose State, but then reeled off a five-game win streak.</p>\n<p>At this point the Gauchos stood tall with their best 20-game start in program history. Only one of their losses came from a team ranked below them in the national rankings.</p>\n<p>The next game was the start of conference play on the road against UC Davis. UCSB came up short in this game and never reverted to its winning ways. The team had more than two weeks off until it traveled to Hawaii to play three games.</p>\n<p>In Hawaii, the Gauchos narrowly defeated San Diego State and were outplayed by Hawaii and USC. UCSB came home to face a red-hot UC Irvine team who was riding an eight-game win streak. The Gauchos were handled by the Anteaters and with only two games remaining, the reigning Big West tournament champions were looking for answers.</p>\n<p>Still searching for their first conference victory, Santa Barbara hosted Long Beach State on senior day in front of a great crowd. Sophomore utility Kate Pipkin tied the game up in the final three seconds of regulation in what turned out to be the most exciting game of the season. Desperate for the victory, the Gauchos battled with the 49ers in six overtime periods, but fell short, dropping to 0-4 in conference matches.</p>\n<p>As deflating as the loss was, the team remained poised and focused on the task ahead: Cal State Northridge. Northridge was winless at home coming into the game and it hadn’t won a Big West regular season meeting since 2015. In a close, hard-fought game, UCSB blew its lead and ultimately lost by one goal.</p>\n<p>Even after ending conference play winless, the Gauchos were still a team to be afraid of in the tournament since they showed promise earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s first game of the Big West Tournament was against none other than Long Beach State, the team that spoiled their senior day. Despite the fact that it was the three seed versus the sixth seed, UCSB had every reason to believe it could win following the hard-fought battle it put up in the two programs’ last meeting.</p>\n<p>After leading for most of the contest, the Gauchos allowed three unanswered goals late and lost by one goal yet again.</p>\n<p>With a sixth-place finish in both the regular season and the tournament, this was not the season the Gauchos had in mind. However, it’s understandable, considering the number of new players that needed to be incorporated.</p>\n<p>The season may not have ended in a terrific way, but there were still plenty of noteworthy performers on the team. Senior utility Taylor Shore ended up leading the team in goals, steals, ejections and field blocks, while Pipkin, the transfer from Indiana, found her role leading the team with 26 assists. Other seniors like attacker Brenna Thomas, utility Jenna Solberg and defender Sophie Trabucco did a little bit of everything in their final seasons.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Sarah Kreiser also chipped in all over the place with her aggressive attacking and defending. Freshman utility Sarah Snyder was second on the team in goals while other freshmen like attacker Natalie Selin and utilities Kate Coski and Abbey Grosse contributed as well with 38 goals combined. Another standout freshman was goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, who finished the season with the third most saves in the Big West.</p>\n<p>With six outstanding seniors graduating, some of the younger players will need to step into bigger roles next season in order to make it successful. As Head Coach Serela Kay continues to build a culture and bring in talented players, this program has great years ahead of itself.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/season-in-review-ucsb-womens-water-polo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/season-in-review-ucsb-womens-water-polo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/season-in-review-ucsb-womens-water-polo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/season-in-review-ucsb-womens-water-polo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/season-in-review-ucsb-womens-water-polo/","id":4907,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4906,4905,4904],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini","biography":"Not available","articles":[1887,4900,4904,4905,4906,4907,4920,4921,4923,4924,4925,4926,4927,4928,4929,4930,4931,4932,4933,4934,5557],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Winless Worries: UCSB and CSUN Look for First Conf.

CSUN hasn’t won a regular-season conference game since 2015 and will hope to avoid repeating last season’s finish of zero conference wins.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Last weekend’s nail-biting defeat to Long Beach State extended UCSB’s losing streak to three games. A victory on the road against a struggling Matador team could provide a late jumpstart of momentum heading into the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>In addition to its seven-game slump, Cal State Northridge’s losing woes include 10 losses in their last 11 games. Over the span of their losing streak, the Matadors have allowed 12 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Notably, CSUN is winless at home this season while UCSB is 2-3 in true road games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a chance to earn their third win over the Matadors this season after defeating them twice in February. Santa Barbara controlled the two previous meetings, securing victories with 11-8 and 11-6 finishes.</p>\n<p>As many teams have experienced, Northridge had absolutely no answer for senior utility Taylor Shore, who poured in four goals in each game. Nonetheless, Shore’s scoring ability is one of many components that help to produce goal-scoring opportunities for her teammates as well.</p>\n<p>This is an opportunity for Shore to get back to her scoring ways, building off her two-goal performance last weekend.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of great players on our team. Even last game we had six different girls that scored seven goals, so it’s not just Taylor [Shore]” Assistant Coach Sierra Peltcher said. “It’s great that other people can step up even if Northridge were to cancel her out.”</p>\n<p>Looking to challenge UCSB’s scoring attack will be Matador junior attacker Madeleine Sanchez, who has risen to the top of the Big West in goals scored on the season. Sanchez’s 60 goals this season is still not enough to top her total of 73 goals last year in her sophomore campaign.</p>\n<p>Only eight players in Big West conference history have recorded more than 73 goals in a single season. Sanchez is one of the few threats to score on a Northridge team that averages the least amount of goals per game (8.14) in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ freshman goalkeeper, Kenzi Snyder, will make it difficult for the Matadors to score with her tremendous play as of late.</p>\n<p>Last weekend the Santa Ana, Calif. native recorded 13 saves and was the focal point to UCSB surviving during its extensive overtime bout. Snyder’s 192 saves this season ranks second in the Big West and first among Big West freshmen. With a strong anchor in the defense, UCSB is capable of disrupting the recent success of the prolific Sanchez.</p>\n<p>As the struggles of Northridge continue, Santa Barbara can bury the Matadors at the bottom of the standings with a victory. The Gauchos are concentrating on what they can control as they head into this crucial part of the year.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our season right now is just focusing on ourselves and working on our plays and tactics,” Peltcher said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will battle Cal State Northridge on Saturday at 12:00 p.m. at Matador Pool to finish off the regular season.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the April 13, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77161\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/winless-worries-ucsb-and-csun-look-for-first-conf-wins-in-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77161\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/winless-worries-ucsb-and-csun-look-for-first-conf-wins-in-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/winless-worries-ucsb-and-csun-look-for-first-conf-wins-in-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/winless-worries-ucsb-and-csun-look-for-first-conf-wins-in-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/winless-worries-ucsb-and-csun-look-for-first-conf-wins-in-season-finale/","id":4904,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4903,4902,4901],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Unfazed by Regular Season, Looks for Fresh Start in Conference Tournament Vs.

The standout redshirt senior defender Christina Kotsia scored a hat trick, while junior utility Virginia Smith netted two goals in the 8-7 nail-biter.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we have to do anything differently,” Kay said. “We went to six overtimes with them so it was anybody’s game, so our game plan doesn’t change.”</p>\n<p>Last weekend Long Beach came up short against Big West regular season champion UC Irvine in an attempt to establish itself as one of the conference best.</p>\n<p>The 49ers only mustered three goals, all from the second half, but held the Anteaters, who finished undefeated in conference play (5-0), to just six goals in the defeat.</p>\n<p>UCSB is 2-2 against LBSU all-time in the conference tournament, most recently in 2015, when Santa Barbara defeated Long Beach in overtime in a game for fifth place.</p>\n<p>The last four meetings between these two sides have all been decided by just one goal.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos can get their revenge on the 49ers, they will matchup against the No. 2 seed Hawaii Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>UCSB took down Hawaii in last year’s tournament final 11-5, a loss that is certainly still in the heads of the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>If UCSB loses to Long Beach State, it will play the loser of UC Davis versus Cal State Northridge in the fifth-place game on Saturday.</p>\n<p>With a four-game losing streak, their longest since February 2016, the Gauchos are ready to give it their all this weekend in their title defense.</p>\n<p>As for the mindset of the team, the reigning Big West Coach of the Year kept it simple: “Finish strong.”</p>\n<p>The last two Big West Tournament champions have been the hosts of the event, Hawaii in 2015 and UCSB last year.</p>\n<p>All the highs and lows of this campaign come down to this one tournament that will define the season for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Long Beach State on Friday, April 29, at 2 p.m. at the Schaal Aquatic Center at UC Davis.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77362\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-unfazed-by-regular-season-looks-for-fresh-start-in-conference-tournament-vs-lbsu-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77362\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-unfazed-by-regular-season-looks-for-fresh-start-in-conference-tournament-vs-lbsu-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-unfazed-by-regular-season-looks-for-fresh-start-in-conference-tournament-vs-lbsu-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-unfazed-by-regular-season-looks-for-fresh-start-in-conference-tournament-vs-lbsu-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/ucsb-unfazed-by-regular-season-looks-for-fresh-start-in-conference-tournament-vs-lbsu-friday/","id":4905,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4904,4903,4902],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls Flat in Conf.

The 49ers kept the trend going as they began to turn this game around.</p>\n<p>Long Beach senior defender Christina Kotsia went on a sole run of three straight unanswered goals to give the 49ers their first lead of the game with 7:10 left in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Less than forty seconds later, UCSB tied it up with a cross cage skip shot goal from senior utility Taylor Shore.</p>\n<p>The final six and a half minutes of regulation were scoreless as the game was headed to overtime even at 6-6</p>\n<p>LBSU took the lead in the first overtime thanks to sophomore defender Annabel Harman’s second goal of the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB failed to score in each of the overtime periods resulting in a 7-6 loss in the first round of the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>The loss put them in the fifth-place game versus Cal State Northridge, who were defeated by the hosts UC Davis in the first round.</p>\n<p>The three previous matchups between UCSB and CSUN this season averaged a total of 17 combined goals.</p>\n<p>This time around only 8 combined goals were scored, the lowest combined goal total that UCSB has been a part of since March 2015.</p>\n<p>After the first quarter Northridge led 1-0 as both sides struggled to get anything going on offense.</p>\n<p>Less than a minute into the second quarter, Thomas tied it up for the Gauchos with a remarkable lob shot as the shot clock expired.</p>\n<p>Junior attacker Madeline Sanchez got the lead back for the Matadors at the 4:49 mark in the second quarter with one of her four goals in the game.</p>\n<p>Those four goals increased Sanchez’s season goal total to 74 which ranks T-8 in Big West single season scoring history beating her total of last season by one goal.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Big West leading goal scorer has scored 2.55 goals per game this season, placing her fourth all time in Big West history.</p>\n<p>With four minutes remaining in the second frame, senior utility Jenna Solberg fired the ball past the goalie from short range to even the score up at 2-2.</p>\n<p>The first half ended with Northridge on top of Santa Barbara by the score of 3-2.</p>\n<p>UCSB tied it up in the third quarter from a Pipkin lob shot in transition, however this was the last goal of the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Sanchez went on to score two goals for the Matadors to end it at 5-3, securing fifth place in the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished in last place in the conference tourney for just the second time in school history.</p>\n<p>Even though this season didn’t pan out as they wished, the Gauchos have a very young and talented core that have a bright future ahead of them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
