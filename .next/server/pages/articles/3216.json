Senate in 2013. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is the only UC student government that has not passed a resolution to divest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s resolution was authored by Letters and Science Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno and is student sponsored by Dylan Kupsh and Fatima Abdel-Gwad. </span></p>\n<p>“[W]e, the Associated Students of UCSB, direct the ASUCSB Investment Advisory Committee, UCSB, the University of California Treasury, and the UC Regents to withdraw investments in securities, endowments, mutual funds, and other monetary instruments with holdings in any of the aforementioned companies or subsidiaries thereof,” this year’s resolution states.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This resolution aims neither to condemn a country, a people, or a community nor to determine a political solution or cast moral judgement, but is solely aimed at ending our University’s support of companies that enable human rights violations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kupsh, who is an active member of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), emphasized the above idea when a draft of the resolution primarily written  by SJP was first released for public comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tonight’s Senate meeting will begin at 6:30 p.m. and will be held in Corwin Pavilion. There are only two items on the agenda: the resolution to divest and the Spring Quarter 2019 elections ballot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As this was written as a directional resolution, 50% + 1 senators must vote yes in order for the bill to pass. The divestment resolution last year </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/senate-fails-to-vote-on-divestment-after-senators-walk-out-of-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">never came to a vote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as senators disagreed about whether last year’s resolution was directional or positional. A positional resolution requires a two-thirds majority to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate is composed of 24 senators, not including Internal Vice President Steven Ho; as of Wednesday morning, three senators have excused themselves for the entire meeting but will be sending proxies in their places. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is a tie, Ho will be responsible for casting the tie-breaking vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution aims to divest from 13 companies: Boeing, CNH Industrial, Caterpillar, Cemex, General Dynamics, General Electric, L-3 Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Siemens, United Technologies Corporation and Valero Energy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents invested over $127 million in these companies during 2018, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the news that divestment would be happening on Wednesday, both anti- and pro- divestment groups created Facebook events aimed at getting more people to attend the meeting and express their opinions about the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/852504278434889/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anti-divestment Facebook event</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, created by Students Supporting Israel, described the resolution as an “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anti-Israel BDS resolution.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We oppose this resolution and we need your presence to demonstrate student opposition to this divisive resolution,” the Facebook description states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/408181696426375/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pro-divestment Facebook event</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, created by Students for Justice in Palestine, states that the resolution “is intended to create a critical dialogue about companies participating in human rights violations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the resolution has been largely symbolic, because while it calls upon the UC system to divest, the A.S. Senate has not had any actual power itself to divest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this year’s resolution notes that A.S. has invested $55.771.96 in DFA Emerging Markets Social Core Portfolio; $19,627.06 in PIMCO Emerging Local Bond Fund; $1,589.28 in iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF; $1,353.00 in iShares MSCI EAFE ETF; and $2,351.25 in iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If tonight’s resolution passes, these investments would stop, Off-Campus Senator Christian Ornelas confirmed.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution in full can be viewed below: </span></p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-Divestment-Resolution.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-Divestment-Resolution.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p>\n<p><em>Updated [4:33 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

As a young league, and with many critical of the women’s game, the WNBA has had to prove itself time and time again.

Headlined by the “Three to See” in Brittney Griner, Elena Delle Donne and Skylar Diggins, these rookies are going to make huge impacts on their teams right away.</p>\n<p>At 6’8’’ and the ability to really dunk, Griner is going to change women’s basketball. The obvious No. 1 pick in the draft, she brings a defensive presence to a Phoenix team that’s already plenty deep with talent.</p>\n<p>Delle Donne has the versatility that will allow her to become a great player in the WNBA. Though not 6’8’’ like Griner, at 6’5’’ Delle Donne is no slouch in the post, but she can also score from anywhere on the court and has the ball handling skills of a guard.</p>\n<p>Then, there’s point guard Diggins, who can get in the lane or drain the three-point shot. She brings leadership to a Tulsa team that should have a successful season since moving from Detroit.</p>\n<p>All in all, the rookies this year won’t be sitting on the bench but will be determining the success of their franchises.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Competitive Games Every Night</strong></p>\n<p>The WNBA only has 12 teams with six in each conference, so that means that every team is stacked. Unlike in the NBA, there’s no taking a night off. With the WNBA season only being 35 games long, every night counts when determining those coveted four playoff spots in each conference.</p>\n<p>In the past, there were teams like Tulsa or Washington that were always in the cellar of their respective conferences, but not this year. Trades and the WNBA draft have taken care of that. Of course, there are still frontrunners in the league, but every night is going to be a competitive battle and a fun game to watch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Phoenix Mercury</strong></p>\n<p>Possibly the biggest frontrunner in the WNBA is the Phoenix Mercury. After a disappointing season last year, in which the entire starting lineup was injured for the majority of the year, the Mercury acquired the No.1 draft pick and therefore picked up the incredible Griner. Griner will certainly be huge. As a run-and-gun team that in 40 minutes would prefer to score into the 100s (they average more points per minute than most NBA teams), Griner will bring a defensive presence to the squad and her rebounding will simply facilitate the fast break.</p>\n<p>However, even as the future of the WNBA, Griner isn’t the focus of Phoenix because they also happen to feature the best player in the world: Diana Taurasi. The scoring champion almost every year since entering the league, Taurasi can take her defender off the dribble or will sink NBA-range threes. Possibly the biggest competitor in the league and with every basketball award/accomplishment already, she has incredible strength and a great basketball IQ.</p>\n<p>Add to that the versatility of Australian Penny Taylor, Candice Dupree, young point guard Samantha Prahalis and DeWanna Bonner, and you’ve got a Mercury team that’s going to be nearly unstoppable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Indiana Fever</strong></p>\n<p>If there’s one team that could take the Mercury down, it’s the defending champions, the Indiana Fever. The Fever are always competitive. Leading the team is the WNBA’s best defender, Tamika Catchings. She wreaks havoc on the other team on the defensive end as the league’s all-time steals leader but on the offensive end can kill you, too. She is comfortable playing in the post or on the wing and can absolutely change a game.</p>\n<p>Her running mate, Katie Douglas, returns after spraining her ankle in the Eastern Conference Finals last year. Yes, the Fever went on to win a title without one of their best players. Douglas, who is a pure shooter and clutch handling the ball, will certainly have some motivation to win another title, as she wasn’t able to be on the court to win her first last year.</p>\n<p>Last season, to win it all, the bench players had to step up, and they did. It created a Cinderella-story ending to the season and all those players returns. Indiana is a veteran squad with plenty of weapons, so while Phoenix on paper may be the team to beat, never count out Indiana.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>An Extended Three-Point Line</strong></p>\n<p>As one of the rule changes to this season, the WNBA is moving back its three-point line. The arc moves from 20 feet, 6-1/4 inches to 22, 1-3/4 inches, the same as the international distance. While moving the line back might make some people think there will be fewer threes, I don’t think fans will see a decrease at all. Virtually all WNBA players play overseas during the offseason and are therefore accustomed to this distance. Even with the old line, there were players making NBA-distance threes.</p>\n<p>With the three-point line moved out, this will only spread the court more and give more space for the players to work with. Plus, it’s another movement toward showing that the women can really play.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So, for anybody that’s never watched the WNBA, I suggest you give it a chance. It’s definitely going to be a season to remember.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/","id":3213,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3212,3211,3210],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Staff Writers Say Their Goodbyes","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/caleb-and-tanner.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/caleb-and-tanner.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"So here it is; my final article for the Daily Nexus.

I was pretty stumped on what to write about and how to write it. In the past when I didn’t know what to write on, I’d choose something that I am very passionate about, usually in-depth baseball articles. However, I thought that my last article required a broader topic with a little bit more of a grandiose style. So I was thinking about trying to incorporate my graduation, and subsequent departure from UCSB, into an article about sports. So here it is.</p>\n<p>Last week I wrote an article on the New York Yankees’ closer Mariano Rivera. I discussed his announcement that he will retire after this season, and that he leads the American League with 18 saves at the age of 43. That article made me realize that I’m at a point in my life where I am seeing the turnover from one sports generation to the next. Very soon the days of Kobe Bryant, Peyton Manning, Derek Jeter, Tom Brady, Kevin Garnett and Mariano Rivera, among so many others, will be gone.</p>\n<p>If I were younger when I realized that the sports generation that I grew up idolizing was leaving, I would have been devastated. I would have resisted such a monumental change to my world. I would have found myself desperately holding on to all of the observations, beliefs and feelings on players, teams and strategies that I had just witnessed retire. Then I finally realized that these observations, beliefs and feelings were outdated. My fantasy league rosters, sports video game performance and everyday sports arguments were slowly withering. I can’t watch and form intelligent opinions on today’s sports with the same observations, beliefs and feelings that I have gathered from the previous generation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So here is the epiphany. The reason why I love sports and why they are truly genuine is because sport and competition is progress. Humans are imperfect, so we love to see the pursuit toward it. We are attracted to perfection. Sport and competition is the constant struggle for perfection — the struggle to beat everyone and to be on top. The sports world is run by the Goliath dynasties who write the history books through their success, but it is the underdog that we need. The underdog is the progress, the player/team/idea that upsets the status quo and keeps the sports world going. I have learned to embrace the new and young with the knowledge of our past. Don’t try to maintain success or become complacent; always get better because everyday there is an underdog working to beat you.</p>\n<p>So in light of graduation, don’t fear or be saddened by leaving UCSB; keep it alive and build on your experience. Don’t be complacent with the thought that UCSB was the lone high point in your life and everything is downhill from here. Live for the pursuit, and for the good times yet to come. Don’t be sad it’s over. Be happy it happened. If we can do that, we can give leaving UCSB, Isla Vista, our new friends and all of our memories a purpose.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/","id":3214,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3213,3212,3211],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.
