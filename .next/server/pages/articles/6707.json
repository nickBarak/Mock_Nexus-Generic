","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Atlanta’s Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, who make up the trio known as Migos, have always made music that is more than just <i>music</i>. They breathe the voice of hip hop’s most vibrant city, they craft anthems for a young and energetic generation and they drop some of the filthiest bangers on the face of this planet. Simply put, it’s more than music. It’s culture.</p>\n<p>Many Migos mixtapes and albums have come and gone, but the hip hop community, internet and culture were especially buzzing for this one. The group had been lurking in the background after the overdone and frankly overrated “Pipe It Up,”and with the dab trend having died out, many dismissed the group as superficial gimmick rappers. But everything changed in October with the single “Bad and Boujee.”</p>\n<p>“Bad and Boujee,” as Donald Glover pointed out in his Golden Globes name-check of the track, is extremely important — for Migos, hip hop and all of us. “Bad and Boujee” showed the world not only that Migos are back stronger than ever, but also that they are making much more than gimmick hits. This song is the thesis statement, manifesto and earth-shattering proclamation of <i>CULTURE</i>, the album and the construct. The infectious bounce of this hit is why the hype is so present around this album, and upon the first listen, this hype is absolutely warranted.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The album opens up with the title track, “Culture.” Featuring DJ Khaled, this song utilizes the most appropriate hypeman possible because, whether you like him or not, Khaled has established himself as a cultural icon over the last year. The next few tracks keep the album’s opening extremely high energy, as heavy-hitting singles “T-Shirt,” “Call Casting” and “Bad and Boujee” follow.</p>\n<p>The rest of the album, which features entirely new material, is extremely consistent with strong production, smooth southern flow and a few well-placed features. Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and Travis Scott, who all mesh perfectly with Migos, have standout roles. “Kelly Price,” featuring Travis Scott, particularly shows the group’s versatility as they weave in and out of a downtempo beat with melodic verses. This album’s strength lies in the ability to go in on a harder beat and contrarily sing well on a slower one. Other highlights include the head nodder “Get Right Witcha,” and a Zaytoven-produced piano banger called “Big On Big.” The contrasts between each track are noticeable and keep the listener engaged throughout the album. The only noticeable flaw is the drawn-out length of some of the songs.</p>\n<p><i>CULTURE</i> is extremely important for the careers of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, as it is the most seriously they have been taken and is the first true album from the group that will be listened to as such. After early breakout hits like the Drake-remixed “Versace” and club favorite “Hannah Montana,” Migos were all about internet presence. They made hot singles that were played for fun at parties, often memed on the internet, and nothing more. However, after signing onto Kanye’s G.O.O.D. Music label and this release of a cohesive and consistent album on the coattails of “Bad and Boujee,” Migos are finally serious hip hop contenders.</p>\n<p>The brilliant X factor in this group’s success is the Migos’ conscious realization of their influence in spaces that transcend music. Upon listening to this album, it is extremely apparent that their approach has changed from a hit-making formula to something both enigmatic and fluid. Quavo, Offset and Takeoff have used Atlanta to create music that is not for profit appeal but for the appeal of themselves, their roots, their experience and their audience. Migos have started a dialogue with their audience that we must engage in — for ourselves, for the music, for each other, for the culture.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/","id":6707,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6706,6705,6704],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales","biography":"Not available","articles":[5770,5788,6540,6607,6625,6638,6648,6652,6659,6688,6699,6702,6707,6744,6760,6765,6807],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Atomics Are a Blast from the Past","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.44.59-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.44.59-PM.png?resize=948%2C362&ssl=1","description":"Not only are these siblings taking the music industry by storm, but also the modeling world.

Some would say the Smiths are “genetically blessed” or “musically talented”—close to having it all. I’ll say they’re definitely something else. With a mere entrance they seem like they’re from the 70s, which may stem from their early upbringing and roots in Spanish Fork, Utah, a small town one hour south of Salt Lake City.</p>\n<p>“We got instruments for Christmas when we were younger. When we first started, we lived in Utah, so we just set up all our instruments in the family room. We’ve been playing since then, but it was probably seven or eight years ago when we said, ‘Let’s form a band and play shows.’ We had our name, ‘The Atomics,’ and that was it. We’ve been doing this for a long time, but it keeps transitioning,” Daisy spilled.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With Lucky on drums, Pyper on bass, Daisy on guitar and Starlie on lead vocals, these siblings are invincible.

Pyper impressed the audience with her dance moves, iconically falling to the ground with her guitar. The song, “Cuz You’re in Love,” was featured in a recent H&amp;M campaign video. It’s slow sound and wave-like beat transformed the audience from jumping up and down to a nonchalant sway. The Smiths closed their set with their latest song, “Voulez Vous,” which was released in October and is available for listening on SoundCloud.</p>\n<p>Not only are these siblings taking the music industry by storm, but also the modeling world. All four are signed with Next Models, Los Angeles. Pyper discussed balancing music with modeling, “Well, I can’t choose between the two because they’re so different, even though they’re both in the entertainment industry. Like with music I’m a bit more free, I play what I want and dress how I want,” she said. “With modeling, everyone’s doing what they want to me and I’m trying to create an image for them. Scheduling wise it’s good because modeling is during the day. There’s set times and our photo shoots are usually in the morning, so I can always do music at night. It’s fun to do both.”</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Voulez Vous by THE ATOMICS\" width=\"888\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F286907145&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=888&amp;maxheight=1000&amp;dnt=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The amazing thing about this family band is how eclectic and original their sound is, yet it’s retro psychedelic. “When we first started playing together we played surf music, so we did a lot of Ventures covers,” Daisy added. “Our influences differ a lot depending on which band member you’re talking to. Like I play guitar, so I love like Dick Dale and Chuck Berry. Lucky loves old school hip-hop beats, while Pyper loves disco music and Starlie loves jazz and soulful singers.”</p>\n<p>With so much to juggle as band mates, modeling partners and siblings, the Smiths’ still get the job done.

We’re going to be in Europe doing shows, so I think it’s going to be a lot of traveling, which is always fun with my siblings,” Pyper said, reflecting on what’s to come in the next few months. “I hope that we can develop our music more because a lot of our songs are different. I hope that we can focus in on a sound we all really love and become tighter as a band.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75421\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75421\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/the-atomics-are-a-blast-from-the-past/","id":6704,"author":{"id":694,"name":"Fiona Moriarty-McLaughlin"},"related":[6703,6702,6701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Switchfoot and Relient K Rock the Arlington","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-04-at-2.28.15-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-04-at-2.28.15-PM.png?resize=900%2C529&ssl=1","description":"Energy surged through the crowd as fans of both groups moved and sung along to new songs and favorite hits alike.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On Thursday evening, alternative rock bands Relient K and Switchfoot performed at the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara as a part of the “Looking for America Tour Part II.” Energy surged through the crowd as fans of both groups moved and sung along to new songs and favorite hits alike. Both bands had plenty of these to perform, as they’ve been active since the late ’90s, and each released an album earlier this year. Switchfoot’s July 2016 album, <em>Where the Light Shines Through</em>, provided the tour’s name with one of its tracks, “Looking for America.” Relient K’s eighth album, <em>Air for Free</em>, was released later that month.</p>\n<p>The show began with Relient K taking the stage, designed to resemble the yard of a quaint cabin in the woods, complete with a white buffalo and a strip of artificial turf. This scene was characteristic of the band, who are “quirky, super-relatable … not-typical rock stars,” as attendee Chad Jordan described. As soon as the band took the stage, they launched into the opening strums of their hit song, “High of 75.” This beginning, met with emphatic applause, preceded upbeat songs such as “Who I Am Hates Who I’ve Been,” “Be My Escape” and “Sadie Hawkins Dance.”</p>\n<p>The music was interspersed with introductions and light-hearted stories from lead singer Matt Thiessen. In a particular moment of nostalgia, he mentioned that during a past tour stop, he purchased 30 shirts at a now-defunct Santa Barbara clothing store. Later in the set, Thiessen noted his band and Switchfoot’s partnership with a charity organization called CURE International, which provides surgeries for conditions such as cleft palates to children who would not ordinarily be able to receive them. Thiessen encouraged the audience to visit the organization’s booth outside, also mentioning to the audience that the first leg of the tour resulted in over 100 surgeries for children.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Relient K concluded their set with their 11-minute song, “Deathbed,” from their fifth album, <em>Five Score and Seven Years Ago</em>. The album version of the song features Jon Foreman, the lead singer of Switchfoot, at the very end, so many fans of the groups undoubtedly hoped he would come on stage to sing his part. Sure enough, when the song neared his cue, the singer came out, embracing Thiessen as he played the piano, then advanced to the microphone to sing. It yielded a very powerful end to Relient K’s portion of the concert.</p>\n<p>Once Relient K’s cabin background and décor was replaced by various monitors, the stage was set for Switchfoot. Each member of the group, save Jon Foreman, came to the stage, with Foreman’s silhouette depicted on a monitor. Foreman began to sing “Holy Water,” and soon made his welcome arrival on stage. The group followed this with one of its earlier hits, “Meant to Live,” shortly after which Foreman wasted no time interacting with the audience. After beginning “Bull in a China Shop,” the lead singer climbed down from the stage and into the audience, balancing on the theatre seats with support from enthusiastic attendees and went back about five rows into the audience before returning to the stage. Foreman made his way into the audience later in the concert as well, creating a very personal experience, especially for those seated near the front.</p>\n<p>After playing a fair amount of more recent songs, especially those from their most recent album, the band played one of their earliest hits and a powerful ballad, “Only Hope.” Toward the beginning of the tune, Foreman urged the audience to turn on their cell phones’ flashlights and sway them with the music, following that up with a request for the stage lights to be shut off. The result was a theater solely illuminated by the spectacle of the tilting lights. The song itself possessed a certain impact as well; attendee and physical therapist Taisa Skovorodkl said she “totally fangirled out on ‘Only Hope,’ cause it was like memories of high school all over again.”</p>\n<p>After several more songs, Thiessen and Relient K’s drummer, Dave Douglas, returned to the stage to contribute vocals, then left Switchfoot to give a proper end to the concert with their most popular hit, “Dare You To Move.” The song was prefaced with Foreman relating that he first sung it shortly after dropping out of college, and that no matter where you are, you don’t know what tomorrow may hold.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/switchfoot-andf-relient-k-rock-the-arlington/","id":6705,"author":{"id":704,"name":"Isaac Mikulski"},"related":[6704,6703,6702],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Elephante Brings Dreamy Beats to the HUB","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elephante-1-26-17-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The energy was already high nearly an hour before Elephante came on, and the Hub filled up quickly for the sold-out show.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past Thursday, Los Angeles-based DJ, Elephante, mesmerized students in the Hub with electronic remixes and resounding drops.

Sarthe played a continuous set, moving from one song to another quickly and smoothly through soundboard effects. He’s a loud, big personality, interacting with the crowd and encouraging everyone to “Get weird.” The energy was already high nearly an hour before Elephante came on, and the Hub filled up quickly.

The upbeat mix of dance, house and mellow EDM is easy for even the most casual electronic music fans to enjoy. He kept the crowd moving all night and students sang along to whimsical lyrics. His brand of music is perfect to let sparks fly; couples danced all throughout the crowd. Elephante’s beats are a clear rebellion against the buttoned-up corporate world, celebrating the simplest moments of electric excitement.

By 10:30 p.m., all you could see was the hands of dancers in front of you illuminated by colorful stage lights on a perfectly transformed dance floor, backed by a beer garden. Flanked by the bookstore and surrounded by popular on-campus restaurants, the Hub really feels like home. Watching artists perform there has an interesting appeal because of how greatly transformed it is from the bustling student center it is during the daytime. It enables UCSB music lovers to magically transform from top scholars to dancers after nightfall.</p>\n<p>A large part of Elephante’s appeal is his background, particularly how he stood up to his family and peers and went after his musical goals. Dropping out of school to pursue a career in the music industry is risky, but it’s undoubtedly paid off for him. Seeing and supporting growing artists is a great way to get exposed to new music and, in Elephante’s case, a great example of a student following their heart. Having an up-and-coming artist play in the Hub is a unique experience we as UCSB students get to experience. There is such a contagious excitement in a room full of young people pursuing their dreams and watching others succeed as well.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/elephante-brings-dreamy-beats-to-the-hub/","id":6706,"author":{"id":705,"name":"Olivia Yazzolino"},"related":[6705,6704,6703],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
