The Aggies rallied, trailing by as few as three points before UCSB regained command, taking a 32-23 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Big Al quickly picked up two fouls within the first two minutes of the second half, giving the junior center four in the game and forcing the Gauchos to turn elsewhere for offensive production.</p>\n<p>Following Big Al’s fourth foul, Bryson scored seven straight points for the Gauchos, giving the team an 18-point lead with 16:31 remaining in the game, its largest lead of the game. Davis would creep to as close as an eight-point deficit, but the Gauchos’ early second-half advantage proved to be insurmountable.</p>\n<p>Despite playing only 16 minutes, Big Al still managed to post a respectable eight-point, 10-rebound performance and now ranks second in the nation in rebounds per game. A pair of sophomore forwards in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler were called upon to play more minutes with Big Al in foul trouble. Each played 17 minutes, with Brewe registering eight points and Beeler pulling down seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>Both proved valuable down low for the Gauchos, as the team controlled the glass with a 43-20 advantage in rebounds on the game.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon continued his stellar play with 11 points, six assists, four rebounds and only one turnover. Harmon ranks second in the nation in his assist to turnover ratio this season.</p>\n<p>Still, the star of the game was Bryson, with his 19 points and seven rebounds. He now ranks second on the team in scoring, right ahead of senior guard Kyle Boswell, who finished with six points on the night.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Corey Hawkins was the only Aggie to register double-digit scoring with 16 points. As a team, Davis shot 38.6 percent from the field compared to a 44.2 percent clip for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now sit in second place in the conference, one game behind Irvine and a game ahead of Long Beach State. With only two games remaining in the regular season, Santa Barbara needs Irvine to drop a game to force a tie for first place in the conference. Each team won on its own floor against each other this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces Hawaii on Thursday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/gauchos-defeat-uc-davis-in-televised-game/","id":548,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[547,546,545],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Moves Into Tie for First in Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Basketball-v-Fullerton-MargaritaBaliyan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Basketball-v-Fullerton-MargaritaBaliyan.jpg?resize=921%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos defeat Fullerton 80-65","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off of a close win over UC Riverside Thursday, the UCSB men’s basketball team needed a win over Cal State Fullerton Saturday to move into first place in the Big West.

Harmon knocked down a pair of threes and matched Fullerton’s entire team with 10 points just eight minutes into the game.</p>\n<p>“Anytime we can get a win like that in a fashion where everybody’s playing well, hustling and executing, it’s always a great feeling,” Harmon said.</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos extended their lead to 27-10, it was smooth sailing. The Titans went on a run to cut the deficit to 32-21, but with less than 30 seconds left in the half, Harmon found sophomore forward Taran Brown for a two-hand facial dunk, sending UCSB to the half with the momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s always exciting to get a dunk because you get the crowd into it and you get your teammates all going crazy on the bench,” junior center Alan Williams said. “It’s an opportunity to increase your level of energy and it’s on [your teammates] to match that.”</p>\n<p>As he has all year, Williams dominated both offensively and defensively. From the opening minutes, the big man played with an extra bounce in his step, making it look easy on his way to a 22-point, 18-rebound double-double on 8-11 shooting.</p>\n<p>The Titans fought back for the entire second half, led by guard Michael Williams. The senior single-handedly kept his team in the game, scoring a game-high 29 points and knocking down 5-10 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos always found an answer, however. Big Al gobbled up every rebound he could reach in the second half, and a one-hand highlight dunk off a loose ball pushed UCSB’s lead back up to 46-29 with just under 13 minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>With just four minutes to go, a three-pointer by Michael Williams cut the Gauchos’ lead to 63-54. The next time down the court, Bryson answered with another UCSB dunk, pushing the lead back up to 11 and dismantling any hope of a Titan comeback. Santa Barbara closed out the final minutes by knocking down free throws on their way to an 80-65 win.</p>\n<p>“It got a little closer [in the second half] but it was nice not to have to fight until the bitter end,” Bryson said. “We’re on a good track right now.”</p>\n<p>Harmon ended the night with 20 points and 10 assists while committing zero turnovers. In his last nine games, he has accumulated 49 assists and just three turnovers.</p>\n<p>“There’s no way we’ve had a player go through a stretch like this since I’ve been here,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He’s been amazing and has just gotten better and more confident as the season’s gone on. He’s absolutely a stud and he’s getting better.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to the road for a first-place showdown against UC Irvine this Thursday.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of Feb. 24th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/ucsb-moves-into-tie-for-first-in-big-west/","id":545,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[544,543,542],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Anteaters in Battle of First Place Teams","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.30.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCI-27_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1.30.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCI-27_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB battles UC Irvine Thursdau night on the road in a matchup of two teams tied for first place in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team has played some important games this season against the likes of Cal and UCLA, but no game this season may be more important than tonight’s road matchup against UC Irvine, the team tied atop the Big West standings with the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Irvine enter the contest tied for first place in the Big West, each with a 9-3 conference record this season. UCSB is 18-7 overall and has won two straight games, while Irvine is 18-10, previously losing its one-game lead on the Gauchos with a loss to Cal State Northridge last Saturday. Needless to say, tonight’s game in Irvine holds major implications for both teams’ chances to finish on top of the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>“I think they’re pretty confident in themselves when we play high level teams and competition,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve played well in big games this year; we played well in the preseason at UNLV and Cal, UCLA and Colorado.

In that victory, however, Irvine was without junior forward Will Davis II, last year’s Big West Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“He’s a key player for them, no doubt. He’s not one of the top three scorers, but what he is, is a really versatile four/five,” Coach Williams said. “Even though you don’t see him at the five much, I think you will see him at times at the five today. I think you’ll see them go to a small team, press us, play small with the five, and it gives them way more versatility than with their big guys they have.”</p>\n<p>Another player to watch for Irvine is freshman Mamadou Ndiaye. The 7’6” freshman is the tallest player in collegiate basketball and ranks 8th in the nation with 3.19 blocks to per game. Irvine features much depth along its starting line with freshman guard Luke Nelson and senior guard Chris McNealy each averaging over 11 points per game.</p>\n<p>Because of its depth, Irvine has played well of late, as the Anteaters were winners of five straight games before falling to Northridge.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the test against Irvine,” Coach Williams said. “We’re sure that they will play much better than when they played here against us, and I think we’re ready for the challenge.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game with plenty of momentum as well, winning six of its last seven games; the lone loss coming in overtime to the same Northridge team. Leading the Gauchos is junior center Alan Williams. Big Al leads the nation with 12.0 rebounds per game and ranks 8th in the country with 22.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Part of [his rebounding ability is] he creates space, but the other part of it is he’s leaner, he’s moving really well, he’s got great instincts, he follows where the ball is going and he reads it really well,” Coach Williams said. “He’s just got great gifts, tremendous feet, tremendous hands, he’s a very good player.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have come to expect greatness from Big Al, another player in junior point guard Zalmico Harmon has emerged as a game-changer for a UCSB team hitting its stride. Harmon ranks second in the nation with a 4.52 assist to turnover ratio and is second in the conference with over 5.2 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Even more impressive, Harmon has compiled 50 assists and only three turnovers in his last nine games. In addition to his superb ball handling, Harmon has also become an efficient scorer for the Gauchos, notching two 20-point games in the last three contests. In the team’s last game, Harmon racked up 20 points and 10 assists, the first Gaucho to accomplish the feat since 1989.</p>\n<p>“He continues to get better. He makes great decisions and takes great care of the ball, obviously,” Coach Williams said. “He’s shooting the ball with much more confidence now, he’s playing his best basketball of the year and we just kind of expect him to continue to grow.”</p>\n<p>No doubt that on Saturday the Gauchos will rely on what has been working for them all year — feeding Big Al down low and relying on its perimeter shooters to hit outside shots and drive to the rim for open looks.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to play tremendous defense against an Irvine squad that ranks first in the conference in field goal percentage at 47.5 percent. Santa Barbara held the Anteaters to under 36 percent in the victory earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Irvine also ranks first in the conference in rebounding and will challenge Big Al, the nation’s top rebounder, down low. In the team’s previous matchup, Big Al managed to dominate as he has done all season with 26 points and 10 rebounds, with the Gauchos winning the battle on the glass by eight.</p>\n<p>“There’s high energy, a lot of emotion in this game because it is such a big game and the environment is going to be hostile and they always bring a good crowd,” Big Al said. “It’s definitely going to be a lot of fun to play there and go up against Irvine. We’re really excited. It’s a big game.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s clash between the first-place teams is scheduled to tip-off at 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center in Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54257\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54257\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/","id":546,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[545,544,543],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Irvine at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Anteaters come from behind to beat the Gauchos 77-74","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Camille Buckley was going to get her numbers for UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>The senior guard that ranks second in the Big West in scoring and first in rebounding during conference play put up nearly identical numbers to the first time UCSB and Irvine played.

However, a 10-0 run by Irvine gave the Anteaters a lead they would never again concede. Six of Irvine’s 10 points in the game-changing run came from a pair of threes from Aguilar.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we let shooters get started. Definitely the difference in the game was Vanessa Aguilar,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Once those (threes) went down, we had our hands full because it gave them new life.”</p>\n<p>Down 73-68, Santa Barbara inbounded the ball to Jemerigbe, who dribbled right and found Zornig at the top of the key. She nailed the trey to bring the Gauchos within two with 41 seconds to go.</p>\n<p>“Coach Mitch drew it up during the timeout,” Zornig said. “We had [senior guard Nicole Nesbit] coming off the flare and she’s a shooter, so they put a lot of attention on her. I set the flare screen and just popped out.”</p>\n<p>However, Nesbit gambled on the inbounds pass, fouling senior guard Kelly Meggs and sending her to the free throw line, which expanded Irvine’s lead up to four.</p>\n<p>Nesbit made up for her mistake quickly, knocking down a clutch jumper on the right wing with 29 seconds left. Nevertheless, Buckley made her shots from the charity stripe on the other end to clinch the victory for the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>Irvine improves to 14-13 overall and 7-6 in the Big West while UCSB drops to 8-18 overall and 3-10 in conference. Since Riverside had a bye yesterday, the Gauchos keep a one-game lead for the eighth and final playoff spot.</p>\n<p>While a loss shows up in the record for Santa Barbara, the team looked much improved from past performances. Nesbit led the team with 20 points while Zornig finished just shy of a double-double with 16 points and nine rebounds. UCSB’s other starters pitched in as well with Jemerigbe adding 13 points and four assists and junior center Clair Watkins also coming so close to tallying the double-double with nine points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“We are a team that I don’t want it to be an individual effort,” Mitchell said. “We have some very talented players, but it was the mistakes that cost us the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to play Saturday against UC Davis for its annual Play for Kay game. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucsb-falls-to-irvine-at-home/","id":547,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[546,545,544],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
