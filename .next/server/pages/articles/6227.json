The law enacts significant health insurance reforms that will take effect over the next several years. But one very important piece of that law is already in place, and it may directly benefit you.</p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act ensures that college students and young adults can stay on their parents’ employer-provided health care plans until age 26. In years prior, many health plans and issuers dropped young adults from their parents’ policies because of their age. That left countless college students, recent college graduates and other young people with little recourse — and worse: no health insurance. Historically, some 30 percent of young adults have been uninsured, a rate far higher than that of any other age group.</p>\n<p>But young people don’t need health insurance, right? The statistics say otherwise: One in six young adults today is faced with a chronic illness such as cancer, diabetes or asthma, and nearly half of uninsured young adults report problems paying medical bills.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The new law ensures you have an option when it comes to your health care. This is important as you continue through school, as well as when you transition into the job market, since you may find that health care coverage is not immediately available through your employer. Or you may work part time. You may choose to continue your education and go to graduate school, or take time off to travel and pursue volunteer opportunities.</p>\n<p>It allows you to remain on your parents’ plan, or rejoin it until age 26, even if you no longer live with your parents, are not a dependent on their tax return or are no longer a student. This new flexibility even applies if you are married. You are guaranteed the same benefits and at the same price that is available to other dependents.</p>\n<p>More health care improvements are on the way and many may also directly benefit you. Already, coverage cannot be denied for those under age 19 because of a pre-existing condition. By 2014, denying coverage to anyone based on a pre-existing condition will be banned; annual dollar caps on care, which are already limited, will be prohibited; state-based health insurance exchanges will create a new marketplace, giving more employers and millions of Americans the ability to purchase affordable coverage.</p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act is based on the simple belief that every American — and that includes college students — deserves access to high-quality, affordable health care. Only one year after it was signed into law, that belief is becoming reality.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34803\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34803\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-28/secretary-labor-defends-healthcare-reform-provisions/","id":6227,"author":{"id":592,"name":"Hilda L.

What I mean by that is that we tend to define moments in our lives not by some sort of objective measure of exactly what happened, but by the way we felt while we were doing it. Instead of remembering the exact details of shows like “Ben 10,” “Johnny Test” or “iCarly,” I tend to remember the way they made me feel: safe and happy, with my bowl of Cocoa Puffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back on those shows today, I still feel nostalgic about them, but it’s hard for my adult(ish) eyes to appreciate them as deeply as I did then. A lot of these shows are racked with cheesy villains, bleh dialogue and boring, predictable plots </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— so </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s hard for me to muster up the same suspension of belief I once so easily could and hop back into a world like that. The nostalgia I feel now just isn’t enough to fill the gap left by this newfound lack of substance, at least for most shows. But there happens to be a very notable exception to this: “Avatar: The Last Airbender.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, I finished rewatching the whole series after many years, and I found myself experiencing many of the same emotions I felt when I first watched it almost 13 years ago: a deep, breathless fascination with the world of the Four Nations and an authentic emotional connection with each of the thoughtful and multifaceted characters. And now, as a semi-adult, I realize just how brilliantly this so-called “kids show” told a compelling and deeply moving story about war, genocide, conquest, honor and most of all, redemption without taking itself too seriously or relying on blood and gore. I truly think it’s one of the best animated shows ever made and a shining example of what great storytelling looks like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story is set in a world in which the people use martial arts to “bend” the four elements: water, earth, fire and air. (In story writing terms, this is a fairly “hard” magic system, in which the rules and costs of using magic are pretty tightly and explicitly defined. Compare this to a “soft” magic system, like the Lord of the Rings universe, in which magic is a mysterious force used by equally mysterious characters with few explicit rules. More on this </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVrnfniQiS8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each group of benders formed a nation around the art of bending their element. Each nation, in a pretty slick story writing move, is designed with characteristics, a value system and culture that centers around the traits of their element. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Avatar, in this world, serves as a guiding force. He/she is the only person with the ability to master all four elements and is tasked with using this immense power to maintain peace in the world. Yet the Avatar mysteriously disappears, and in his absence, an increasingly militant Fire Nation decides to “share their prosperity” with the rest of the world and sets its sights on total world domination. Without seeing any blood or gore, we are shown the results of the ensuing genocide: the entirety of the Air Nomads have been wiped out, the Water Tribe has been crippled and the Earth Kingdom is under heavy siege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been a hundred years since the war began and the Fire Nation is close to victory, until two siblings, Katara and Sokka, discover Aang, who is revealed to be the Avatar. After seeing what the world has become in the Avatar’s absence and what happened to his friends and teachers, Aang vows to learn the other three elements, take on the Fire Nation and restore balance to the world. Katara and Sokka join Aang on his quest and are pursued all around the world by Prince Zuko: a relentless, arrogant and banished prince from the Fire Nation who’s been told that the only way he’s going to be welcomed home is if he captures the Avatar. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In building these characters, the show gives a deeply personal account to the consequences of war: the shattering of lives, the depth of the human capacity for evil and the ability of a humble and courageous individual to find hope. I could spend hours talking about all the brilliant characters in this series, but I want to focus on two in particular that created one of the most satisfying redemption stories I’ve ever seen: Prince Zuko and his uncle Iroh.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning of the show, Prince Zuko is exactly what he sounds like: a complete asshole. He’s callous, rude and reckless, often willing to cross any lines necessary (including endangering the lives of his ship’s soldiers) to have his royalty restored. He has a completely backwards sense of right and wrong, and on first glance, he seems… boring. Just a typical cynical bad guy with a bone to pick. But the show provides us with flashbacks and tells us Zuko’s heart-wrenching story.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89291\" style=\"width: 665px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2053533590\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89289\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89291\" data-attachment-id=\"89291\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/zuko/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=655%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"655,486\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"zuko\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=655%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89291\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?resize=655%2C486\" alt=\"\" width=\"655\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?w=655&amp;ssl=1 655w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?resize=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89291\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Nickelodeon</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are taken back to a war strategy meeting in which Zuko, as the Crown Prince, sits next to his father Fire Lord Ozai. One of the generals suggests a strategy that purposely sacrifices Fire Nation soldiers to gain an edge in a battle. Without waiting for his turn to speak, Zuko angrily protests, asking how they can consider themselves leaders of the Fire Nation when they are willing to throw away civilian lives for next to nothing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By speaking out, Zuko is accused of being disrespectful not only to the general, but to the person who called the meeting: his own father, Fire Lord Ozai. To teach Zuko “respect,” Ozai challenges him to an Agni Kai, a ritualistic duel between two firebenders to resolve a fight. At the arena, Zuko realizes who he has to battle and breaks down in tears, refusing to fight his own father. His father sees this as an act of weakness and burns Zuko, permanently scarring his face, as well as banishing him from the Fire Nation.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is here that we realize that Zuko’s arrogance comes from a deep sense of shame within him: his whole life, he was told by the world that he wasn’t enough. He is disrespectful because no one ever showed him respect or treated him like a human being. He disregards his soldiers’ lives because he was made an outcast for</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trying to care for them</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That’s why his sense of right and wrong is so backwards: he lost his family, honor, nation and life for</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trying to be good</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always found that the most compelling villains are the ones who you understand. You don’t need to agree with them or endorse their end goal, but if you experience their journey, you can’t help but empathize with them on some level, and both them and the story feel much more real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, Zuko finds his way back to the Fire Nation as Crown Prince, back by his father’s side. He has everything he thought he wanted: a home, a family and a nation, but he feels distressed and unsatisfied. To get here, he betrayed his uncle Iroh, the only real father figure in his life, who had begged him to look inside himself and ask if this was what he really wanted. These feelings of guilt and unhappiness overwhelm Zuko. After learning of the terrible devastation his father plans to wreak on the world, Zuko realized that this identity of a fierce, proud and loyal Fire Nation prince was an identity that was handed to him and not his own. In pursuing his redemption, Zuko never stopped to consider if the future he was fighting for was a good one, or if he </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even really wanted it</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Zuko went on his hunt for the Avatar, he journeyed across the Four Nations. He didn’t see a world grateful and awed by the Fire Nation; he saw a world terrified by it. He saw the consequences of his terrible actions and the harm they had caused. Zuko decides that no matter his past, it’s his duty to do whatever he can to end the war. In a jaw-dropping turn, he asks Aang for forgiveness and asks to teach him firebending and help him defeat his father. He finds his uncle, and in one of the most emotional scenes in the show, begs for his forgiveness. Iroh, teary eyed, hugs him, saying, “I was never angry with you. I was just sad because I thought you had lost your way. But you found it again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most beautiful messages in “Avatar: The Last Airbender” is this: making mistakes doesn’t mean you’re an unworthy or bad human being. It just means you’re a human being. Instead of continuing to lie to himself and the rest of the world about who he was, Zuko decided to own his mistakes and use the strengths he had to humbly guide the world in a better direction. He wasn’t a hero in spite of his mistakes; he was a hero </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because of</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his mistakes, and what he learned from them. In doing so, he became greater than any of us could have ever imagined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From its beautiful animation style to its inspiring story, this show presents to us the brutal consequences of war and ideology, the capacity of humans to do great good as well as great evil and the importance of mistakes and humility. This could have been a much, much longer review, but suffice it to say that “Avatar: The Last Airbender” has a message many of us could really use right now. It asks us to make a genuine effort to understand each other’s stories and not hate others (and perhaps more crucially, ourselves) because of mistakes that are made. Yes, there are awful people in the world, but refusing to let contempt cloud our emotions can be the difference between a broken and a healing society. Overall, I love this show with all my heart, and I’m a better person because of the lessons it taught me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10/10 – Masterpiece</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89289\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89289\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/","id":6224,"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit"},"related":[6223,6222,6221],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Israeli Blockade Bars Entry of Essential Medical Services","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Not too long ago, there appeared an Op-Ed in the Daily Nexus entitled “False Body Count Numbers Disguise Political Agenda.”","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Not too long ago, there appeared an Op-Ed in the Daily Nexus entitled “False Body Count Numbers Disguise Political Agenda.” The author of this piece, Mr. Gluschankoff, cited the inferiority of Palestinian medical care to justify the number of deaths incurred by the Israeli army during their 2008 massacre of Palestinians in Gaza. I am not going to bother explaining why such a statement is implicitly racist; rather, I will move on to explain why Palestinians in Gaza do not have access to proper medical services.</p>\n<p>You see, Gaza has been subjected to a siege imposed on Gazans by both the former Egyptian government (thus, Israel’s staunch support for its now-ousted dictator) as well as by the Israeli government; both Egypt and Israel “share” (a characterization not at all appropriate given that the Palestinians are completely left out of the equation) borders with Gaza. From 2005 until now — as well as during Operation Cast Lead, which killed 1,400 Palestinians and injured around 5,000 — Gazans have been denied freedom of mobility to cross these borders. Medical equipment has also been barred from entering Gaza; in effect, infringing upon the right of Palestinians to maintain their hospitals and, thus, their health and livelihoods.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 10 of this year, Israeli strikes destroyed a medical storage building as well as damaged a school in Gaza. This is just one instance of a consistent attempt on the part of the Israelis to hinder development and undermine the building of infrastructure in Palestine (Gaza included) to aid the well-being of those who are essentially living in an open-air prison facility. It is one of many instances that demonstrates the perpetuation of an environment where the needed resources to create self-sustainability and an economy on which they are able to thrive is denied to them. The Palestinians are unwanted, as their existence makes evident the nature of the Israeli state as a colonizing entity carrying out an ethnic cleansing of the indigenous people whose lands they have stolen.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As Laila el-Haddad puts it, “So long as those in power in Palestine are not willing collaborators in their own imprisonment, the consequences will be fierce: Institutions will be destroyed, development and prosperity will be blocked and the pretext will always be security.” To elaborate, Time magazine’s Tim McGirk reported that Israel was blocking medical aid from reaching Gaza and shed light on the case of Bassam al-Wahedi, who was in need of serious eye care. The equipment needed to conduct “complicated surgeries” was and continues to be barred from entering Gaza. Al-Wahedi was offered medical treatment by Israel if he agreed to work for the Israelis. Collaborate with us for two weeks, they told him, and we’ll get you the best Israeli doctor out there. If he refused to collaborate, he would be denied access. Al-Wahedi could not bring himself to collaborate with the Israeli state to aid his people’s oppression. He recounted that “his father, an ambulance driver, was clearing away wounded Palestinians after a battle when he was shot dead by an Israeli sniper.” This is yet another example as to why Palestinian medical services are “inferior” to those of their colonizer, the Israeli state.</p>\n<p>The bombing of Palestinian hospitals by the Israeli Defense Force during Operation Cast Lead contributed to the lack of available medical care within Gaza; this should go without saying. Of course, all this contradicts the pretty portrait of the Israeli state painted by the various authors of the many pro-Israel pieces that have been published by the Nexus; there is an assumption within all these pieces that Palestinians are to be blamed for their suffering; that their suffering is somehow warranted by the fact that Israel is an ally of the U.S. and an example of “Western progress” and “civilization.” One of the founders of Zionist thought, Theodor Herzl, would have been proud. He, too, asserted that Israel would act as “a rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization as opposed to barbarism.” It is telling to know that many supporters of Israel have followed the racist tradition of Zionism, as they use Eurocentric concepts of industrial “progress” and technological innovations to justify a massacre. God help us in a world where massacres are embraced as civil and ethnic cleansing is considered an act of progress.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/israeli-blockade-bars-entry-essential-medical-services/","id":6225,"author":{"id":591,"name":"Noor Aljawad"},"related":[6224,6223,6222],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Traveling Gaucho Witnesses Reality of Middle East Conflicts","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After studying abroad for six months in the heart of “the holy land,” Jerusalem, I would like to share some insight into the real situation on the ground in Israel.

Most students with busy lives have very little time between sips of beer and Four Loko (R.I.P.) to read the extensive histories of every modern conflict. Instead we must rely on the media to give us the SparkNoted version. Unfortunately, the media sometimes fails to act responsibly in delivering the “big picture” of a conflict to unsuspecting readers. The point of this article is not to be condescending, but to share my account as a foreigner witnessing firsthand the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>\n<p>I have studied and toured extensively Israel/Palestine and some of its neighbors, much to the chagrin of my parents (My mom every other week: “You went where?!”). I have seen riots unfold in the Old  City and near my dorms, as well as witnessed bomb squads blow up suspicious packages from my window. I have walked and driven through hundreds of Israeli checkpoints and spoken with many Palestinians and Israelis. I have tried my hardest to get the most out of my experience here in the Middle East, both intellectually and emotionally. I can confidently say that the situation here should be viewed with great optimism, but also with sensitive empathy.</p>\n<p>When I sit down to eat lunch in the (awesomely delicious) student cafeteria on campus, I cannot help but feel strong emotions as I see a growing line of students waiting for their bags to be searched by an Uzi-wielding guard before they can eat. The cafeteria had been the site of a horrific bombing no more than eight years ago during the second intifada, killing nine students and wounding almost a hundred.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

\r\n</script> \n<p>It is hard to imagine someone wanting to kill the very generation that is trying to study and bring about peace. Palestinians and Israelis try to avoid speaking about those times, as the horror experienced by both sides is almost beyond comprehension. Listening to stories from Israelis about their near death experiences from suicide attacks is equally appalling as listening to Palestinians speak about Israeli tanks firing on the guerillas shooting from the home next door. Try to imagine a bomb exploding at the dining commons if the student population of the university were reduced to just the two towers of FT (also R.I.P.) and not 25,000. Paranoia and fear are still very much a reality on the streets in Israel as each resident is reminded of these emotions every time they pass through a checkpoint or a metal detector (which is often).</p>\n<p>Over 80 percent of Israeli citizens have or are serving in the Israeli armed forces and 100 percent are related to or know someone in the armed forces. For the aforementioned reasons, it is practically impossible to withdraw yourself from the greater conflict in Israel, yet the perseverance of the Israeli and Palestinian people has allowed them to attempt to lead relatively normal lives.</p>\n<p>Israeli and Palestinian media is overwhelmed with headlines about the conflict. The U.S. and Europe, however, are guilty of not caring about peace. Obama’s current political plight is a prime example of this as people generally care more about the federal deficit than his accomplishments in the international environment. Just checking the front page of an Israeli newspaper, such as <em>Haaretz,</em> an Arab newspaper like <em>Al-Jazeera</em> or speaking with an Israeli or Palestinian, will show the dedication of both parties to studying and solving the conflict.</p>\n<p>Asking if Israelis OR Palestinians care about peace is as ridiculous a question as asking if a homeless person cares about his next meal. Let’s try to be more vigilant discussing other cultures, conflicts and histories. Let us step out of our bubble and intentionally put ourselves in vulnerable positions for the sake of understanding cultures different from our own, so that we may gain some much needed perspective that is not spoon-fed to us by <em>Time</em>, CNN or Fox News.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/traveling-gaucho-witnesses-reality-middle-east-conflicts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/traveling-gaucho-witnesses-reality-middle-east-conflicts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/traveling-gaucho-witnesses-reality-middle-east-conflicts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/traveling-gaucho-witnesses-reality-middle-east-conflicts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-02/traveling-gaucho-witnesses-reality-middle-east-conflicts/","id":6226,"author":{"id":594,"name":"Daniel Aaronson"},"related":[6225,6224,6223],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
