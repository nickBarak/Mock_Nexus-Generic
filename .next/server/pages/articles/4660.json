The Gauchos head into the series after a successful weekend as they are winners of four straight. Texas welcomes Santa Barbara having just snapped a four game losing streak with a decisive 6-1 victory against Texas Pan-American.</p>\n<p>“The key [to the weekend] is just to get our young guys to go play the game of baseball and not play Texas,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We need to have the attitude of Texas is playing us and we are playing the game of baseball and that is really the message to our guys. The pitching mound is still going to be 60 feet, six inches and first base is still 90 feet away.”</p>\n<p>Texas at 7-5 so far this season got off to a great start. The Longhorns began the year at 6-1 and swept Nebraska at home before hitting the losing streak against the likes of Sam Houston State and Stanford.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Longhorns are led by preseason All-American junior pitcher Corey Knebel. Knebel was named to the second team as well as the Stopper of the Year watch list and Golden Spikes watch list. So far this year, the closer has recorded three saves in 11.1 innings pitched and is just 11 saves away from passing Houston Street as the schools all-time saves leader. Knebel headlines a bullpen that has kept the Longhorns a perfect 7-0 when leading through six innings.</p>\n<p>The 8-4 Gauchos, currently in fourth place in the Big West, look to take advantage of the strong Texas pitching by continuing their hot hitting. Over the four game winning streak, the Gauchos have outscored their opponents 24-7, and in the last four games have twice won in their last at bat. The success of the offense stems from the ability to get the lead-off runner on board.</p>\n<p>“We like to get guys moving and run. We sacrifice bunted a lot last year and haven’t as much this year,” Checketts said. “Our first order of priority is to steal and if you can’t run on the pitcher or catcher the second option is to hit and run. If the guys got really good stuff we will go to sac bunting because we like to keep guys moving and put pressure on people.”</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB is hitting a solid .280 on the year. Sophomore utility man Woody Woodward leads the team with a .438 average and a stellar .561 on base percentage. Woodward and sophomore centerfielder and leadoff hitter Cameron Newell lead the team with 10 and 11 runs scored, respectively, and are driven in regularly by the heart of the order thanks to consistent hitting from junior shortstop Brandon Trinkwon and sophomore first baseman Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>“I imagine if we think the pitcher is going to be on his game and that it will be tough to put up a couple runs we will be bunting and stealing more than usual,” Trinkwon said. “But if he is off his game you may see us swing away.”</p>\n<p>The weekend matchups and projected starters are sophomore Austin Pettibone at 5p.m. on Friday, freshman Justin Jacome at noon Saturday and sophomore Andrew Vasquez at 10 a.m. on Sunday at the University of Texas’ Disch-Falk Field.</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/gauchos-face-longhorns-in-texas/","id":4660,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[4659,4658,4657],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner","biography":"Not available","articles":[682,709,1786,1788,1802,3217,4453,4456,4457,4458,4467,4472,4474,4475,4476,4477,4478,4479,4481,4493,4495,4496,4497,4498,4501,4503,4506,4660,4664,4666,4667,4668,4669,4670,4671,4672,4673,4683,4684,4685,4686,4687,4688,5162,5302,5304,5354,5370,5372,5373,5374,5375,5376,5377,5379,5380,5381,5382,5385,5386,5392,5410,5412,5414],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

The Commission made it a goal to better address the concerns of the public in the upcoming meeting, which will include a presentation by staff from the Santa Barbara County Planning and Development and Santa Barbara County Public Works to discuss proposed parking strategies mentioned in the Isla Vista Master Plan.</p>\n<p>Fifth District SB County Planning and Development Commissioner Daniel Blough said he was doubtful of the survey results.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know when they did the survey, but the information was not accurate,” Blough said.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year mathematics major Brent Roth, the parking situation in I.V. is not conducive to students or residents, and parking spots are too small and not secure.</p>\n<p>“The parking situation in Isla Vista is just terrible, I can’t stress that enough,” Roth said. “The biggest issue is space and ensuring that your car is safe.”<br>\nFourth-year environmental studies major Lino Martinez said he has not seen a recent increase in parking.</p>\n<p>“The increase in 15 percent doesn’t seem like it represents actually what is occurring,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>According to Second District SB County Planning and Development Commissioner Cecilia Brown, the duty of the Planning Commission is to obtain accurate information regarding the current state of parking in I.V. with help from Isla Vista residents.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the meeting is to get current pertinent information about the parking situation and to get greater community input,” Brown said.</p>\n<p>Brown said she is glad there will be a meeting where the public can participate.</p>\n<p>“They need to participate, they need to come and tell the county what their experience is,” Brown said. “Their input is valuable.”</p>\n<p>County of SB Planning and Development Associate Planner Katie Hentrich said community input from the meeting this Monday will be discussed at the next Committee meeting.</p>\n<p>“The County is seeking feedback on the proposed parking strategies to survey parking availability,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>Hentrich said both the Planning and Development and the Public Work staff will present various solutions to the parking situation in I.V.</p>\n<p>“The proposed parking strategies include an on-street parking monitoring and reporting system to assess on-street parking capacity and vacancy rates in the community,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>If available parking is found to be below an increase of 15 percent then more surveys will be taken to find new strategies such as a permit system, according to Hentrich.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, if data results indicate vacancy rates remain low, a permit parking program would be implemented,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>Hentrich said she encourages community members to attend the meeting.</p>\n<p>“This meeting is a good opportunity for permanent residents and students to participate in the planning process,” Hentrich said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

Isla Vista is a friendly and fun place, so it should be enjoyed. But being conscious of what you or your friends are doing will keep you safe, out of jail or getting the infamous MIP (Minor in Possession) … Although it’s an amazing place, Isla Vista unfortunately falls victim to crimes like theft, assault and sexual assault.</p>\n<p><strong>Mosbey:</strong> Even though we are in a relatively safe community, be aware of areas with poor lighting and do not engage those who are behaving in an antagonistic manner towards you. When going out be sure to keep track of your drink and never allow anyone to make or give one to you.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What should students do to prepare for potentially dangerous situations?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The easiest way to get yourself into trouble is by not knowing what you or your friends plan on doing. If you’re going to drink and walk DP, which every freshman will understandably do, have a game plan if things don’t work out. Eat some food before, have an idea of where you want to go, have a backup plan if that doesn’t work out (Freebirds nachos are a solid move), and make sure you know where your friends are when you want to head back home. Pouring too many shots back and aimlessly wandering Isla Vista after not getting into any parties is a surefire way to get yourself into some trouble.<br>\nMosbey: When you go out, be sure to have friends accompany you and keep track of each other throughout the night! Familiarize yourself with the local area and as well be aware of the safest routes to take. Be sure to take care of your personal belongings and keep track of them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What are some resources that students can access when they need help?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The number-one resource students should be aware of is the CSO Escort program. The number is (805) 893-8000 … Call 911 if you or anyone around you is in any danger, perceived or real. The Isla Vista Foot Patrol can respond to a call very, very quickly and should always be reached out to … Good Samaritan Laws in California provide both the caller and the one in medical need amnesty from prosecution for minor crimes like minor in consumption or drug use. Their priority is getting the person in need of medical attention to the hospital, not citing you a MIP. So don’t hesitate to call.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services is the most valuable resource this campus has for students seeking mental help of any kind, ranging from the most benign forms of stress to other more serious disorders. There should be no stigma associated with wanting to seek help — Counseling and Psychological Services just fought a huge battle against UC budgets to stay a strong force on this campus, and students should really be utilizing this wonderful service more.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> Who can students reach out to if they need help?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> Make sure to go to your friends as a support group, no one will be there for you like the friends you meet here at UCSB. Professors can be great help when your course load is getting crazy. Stop by their office hours and you will be amazed how helpful they can be. The SRB [Student Resource Building] has a mind-boggling amount of services. The Womyn’s Center is an amazing resource for many things, including any services pertaining to sexual assault. If you are injured out in Isla Vista or wherever and are having trouble getting to class, check out the Disabled Students Program in the SRB for help.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> When students start to feel that they need help, the most important thing to do is NOT TO STAY QUIET! There are so many people who want to help, and all you have to do is ask. Don’t know where to go? Start with your RA. Don’t have an RA? Walk right into Student Health or Counseling and Psychological Services. No one is judgmental; everyone wants you to do well and BE well.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What do you recommend students bring with them when they go into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Mosbey:</strong> Always be sure to have some form of ID when you go out, preferably a state-issued or government ID, as well as a fully charged phone, emergency contact information and your keys (for those who are prone to losing them, buy a carbineer or lanyard.)</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Buddy system. Too often have students wandered off by themselves, and most end up fine, but some have gotten into situations they did not intend, which can have really serious repercussions … When you go out, always carry a form of ID on you … Also bring an open, but grounded mind and heart. Being under any influence may make you more prone to decisions you wouldn’t make otherwise, so make sure to always have your best interests take priority over everything else.</p>\n<p><em><strong>DN:</strong> What are common mistakes made by students, especially freshman or transfers, when they go into I.V.?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Minoiefar:</strong> The most common mistake made in Isla Vista is not spacing out your shots or handle pulls. It’s really easy to fill time between conversations with shots. But what we don’t realize until we make this mistake a few times, is that five shots in one hour is a lot. You won’t feel any shots you take for 30 minutes after you take it at the very least, and it’s usually more like an hour. So if you’re not spacing your shots out, you’re gonna have a bad time when it all hits you. Best way to avoid this is to know that saying no to a shot really isn’t that big of a deal … [people] will forget about it in less than a second.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Young adults at this age haven’t fully developed critical decision-making parts of their brain yet, so it’s difficult to figure out if you’re really making the right decision if you are thrust into a neighborhood where there are little to zero authority or parental figures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 6 &amp; 7 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64808\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64808\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-24/how-to-stay-safe-without-staying-in-on-friday-night/","id":4658,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[4657,4656,4655],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Revisit I.V.

Clinic Tuesday night hosted by Assemblymember Das Williams’s office to discuss self-governance in I.V.</p>\n<p>Attendees addressed the parking meeting held Monday night, hosted by Santa Barbara County in conjunction with Planning and Public Work staff. Stakeholders scheduled specific topics to be discussed at the following meeting through mid-February.</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident and business owner Jay Freeman said he did not like the presentation-oriented structure of the parking meeting. According to Freeman, attendees contested the results of a previous parking survey which found a 15 percent increase in parking in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was all a power-point presentation format and we all had only three minutes to say what we didn’t like about the parking study,” Freeman said. “Essentially everyone made the argument, ‘well we don’t have any parking spaces even though you found 15 percent parking.’”</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. resident Bonnie Murdoc said she is concerned about UCSB’s involvement in the suggested parking permit program, and is suspicious the University will push students to pay for campus lots.</p>\n<p>“I feel they have another objective,” Murdoc said. “They want people to pay in their lots or want to make parking expensive enough in Isla Vista that people will use their lots. That concerns me.”</p>\n<p>Field Representative from Williams’ office and UCSB alumnus Cameron Schunk said the SB County Sheriff’s Department will not be responsible for enforcing parking permits in I.V.</p>\n<p>“In our most recent conversation, the Sheriff was not willing to be responsible for the enforcement of a parking permit program in Isla Vista,” Schunk said. “Basically saying we don’t have enough manpower to do it without paying them.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65048\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65048\" data-attachment-id=\"65048\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-07/stakeholders-revisit-i-v-self-governance/stakeholders_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444157215\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"140\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65048\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-65048\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Community Organizer from Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said issues concerning parking services are complicated.</p>\n<p>“There’s so many different directions we could go with this,” Elliott said. “There’s so many parts of it.

Everyone has their own vision of what a parking program will look like in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Elliott said she wants to create a subcommittee to tackle issues specific to parking in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It needs to be a diverse group of people with different representations of various demographics in I.V.,” Elliott said. “The parking program could affect everyone in different ways.”</p>\n<p>According to Elliott, the subcommittee would create a proposal for an I.V. parking program to present to the California Coastal Commission and the community for feedback.</p>\n<p>“They would then present it at a meeting with the Coastal Commission and the community,” Elliott said. “They will be there to give us feedback on the proposal.”</p>\n<p>Elliott also said some I.V. residents are disappointed the recently appointed Community Resource Deputy (CRD), James McKarrel, is monolingual.</p>\n<p>“They said he wouldn’t be able to reach out to Latino communities and that’s part of what the community resource deputy is supposed to do,” Elliott said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65047\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65047\" data-attachment-id=\"65047\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-07/stakeholders-revisit-i-v-self-governance/stakeholders_by-lorenzo-basilio-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1331&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1331\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444156197\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"160\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.003125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Lorenzo Basilio-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65047\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stakeholders_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-65047\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Schunk said there are limited options when hiring a CRD, as the S.B.
