the clubs on campus to educate the student body on their rights,” Morse said. “I am hoping to work with the county and help develop the 501(c)3 I discussed during the campaign season — hopefully formalize and organize the festivals and major events in the Isla Vista area and help … the county feel like our event next year will be responsible and safe so that we don’t need to implement the martial program that we have this past year.”</p>\n<p>Morse also said he would work to develop the party further for action next year.</p>\n<p>“This is something that has been a topic of discussion among some of our supporters and there are a number of people that have shown interest in running next year, so I’m hoping we’ll be able to take the summer to fine tune our message a little bit,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said he was looking forward to Paola Dela Cruz’s tenure as EVPLA.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited for Paola to take office — I think she’ll do an incredible job,” Schunk said. “I’ve had the privilege of working with her over the past year and from what I’ve seen she has been an absolute powerhouse, to say the least.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he was also excited that a fee initiative to maintain services at the Pardall Center in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Tonight I was actually very happy the fee initiative that I spearheaded called ‘Mainting A.S.’s Presence in Isla Vista’ passed with a 61 percent popular vote so that will help maintain services at the Pardall Center and make sure that that space is being used.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62726\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

science major and presidential candidate Jason Garshfield said though he did not win the election, he was glad to bring attention to topics throughout his campaign that otherwise may not be discussed.</p>\n<p>“There were a number of ways we could have won,” Garshfield said. “One was by getting the greatest number of votes up there and another was by making a difference in the way students talk about these issues and bringing issues to the forefront that wouldn’t be at the forefront.”</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, he hopes to work with Villarreal next year and to strengthen the Free Thinking Patriots party he founded.</p>\n<p>“I would be thrilled to stick around in student politics and continue making a difference in any way that I can,” Garshfield said. “I would love to work in Jimmy’s administration if possible … and I would still love to see an FTP resurgence and one candidate elected is one more than a lot of people expected.”</p>\n<p>Third-year history of public policy major and president-elect Villarreal said he is looking forward to fulfilling his position as A.S. president in the upcoming year.</p>\n<p>“I’m so excited to start serving the students. I’ve done it for a couple years, but it’s just great every year to see that students want to participate in the whole electoral process, that they want to get educated on, you know, who’s coming out and I’m just really excited to start the year,” Villarreal said. “I was nervous. It’s always fun; it’s always a little nerve wracking during the election period but just now I’m ready to start going to work.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major and current EVPSA Melvin Singh said he is apprehensive about the UC tuition hikes and expressed his willingness to aid Mirza and Lopez in their continued work with A.S.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern is seeing how tuition increase and all that will go next year, and making sure both of them are prepped for it, and of course I’m going to be there to prep them before I term out,” Singh said. “I mean I was pretty comfortable being in that room and seeing whatever happened so at this point I’m just making sure both of them are set for their path from now on.”</p>\n<p>Incoming IVP and third-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian said while she is looking forward to taking office, she was disappointed her fellow Open People’s Party EVPSA candidate Lopez lost the campaign.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62781\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"444391965\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62764\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62781\" data-attachment-id=\"62781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/a-s-elections-end-with-near-sweep/elections-will-tran-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429817311\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elections Will Tran-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62781 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Elections Will Tran-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-62781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former executives came by to see the election results. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“As a party it’s like we don’t win until we all win, so we were very nervous about the EVPSA position and once his is announced it was kinda like the mood kinda went down,” Hashemian said. “So when mine was announced I was excited but at the same time, you know, in my mind there was still the fact that our EVPSA did not win so it’s not as joyous as I wish it were.”</p>\n<p>Current Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said she is satisfied with her accomplishments during her term in office and is looking forward to the continued improvements to be made by Hashemian.</p>\n<p>“What I hope that she can improve from what I did last year is just to really transition better and do a better orientation for the entire association,” Lau said. “I thought I did a really good job with the senators and the senators I felt like were really equipped with all the different resources and things they needed to know to be in office. But one thing I want Kimia to kind of take from what I’ve done in the past is to really focus on the transition of the entire association and to make sure that the institutional knowledge is passed on from one generation to the next.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth year-psychology and sociology double major Ali Guthy praised the candidates, particularly Villarreal for his ability to act as president.</p>\n<p>“All the candidates that ran — write-ins, independents, affiliated — were all excellent candidates, and I’m sure they will all do their best to make the association better,” Guthy said. “The biggest thing in this job is dealing with the unpredictable and anything that might be thrown your way, and Jimmy has lots of experience in A.S. on a lot of different issues, so I know he’ll be able to handle whatever is thrown at him,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Mirza said he received a broad base of support for various campus organizations and is looking forward to repaying them through his actions.</p>\n<p>“It’s an overwhelming feeling, to run as an independent without a party. I’ve just received so much love and support from groups on campus,” Mirza said. “Their love kept me going and that’s why we’re here. I got nothing but respect for my opponent Carlos but I think throughout the year we’re gonna do a lot of great things and I’m looking forward to repaying the students’ faith in me.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62730\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62730\" data-attachment-id=\"62730\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/a-s-elections-end-with-near-sweep/elections_lorenzo-basilio-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429780515\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"16\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elections_Lorenzo Basilio-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62730 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"USE THIS AS MAIN PICTURE FOR ELECTIONS ARITCLE.

id=\"caption-attachment-62580\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Sigma Pi and Kappa Sigma fraternities hosted Walk a Mile in Her Shoes Friday night, leading a march from Storke Tower to Embarcadero Hall as part of a movement to end rape, sexual assault and gender violence.</p>\n<p>Approximately 150 students participated in the two-hour long event, walking in heels or other feminine clothing to promote safety and respect for women. Walk a Mile in Her Shoes began in 2001 in Northern California and has since grown into a worldwide movement, with tens of thousands of men donning heels to demonstrate the importance of the cause.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sexual assault is more than just a ‘Greek’ issue. It is a human issue. Even one case of sexual assault is one too many … – Sigma Pi Herald Austen Mauch</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year biology major Kevin Duong said he hopes the event will help alleviate the negative image of fraternities contributing to rape culture on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“I loved this event. My high school took part in walks every semester and seeing it take place in college is an absolutely amazing sight,” Duong said. “We, as fraternity men, want to work with the community to benefit everybody and having the thought of ‘Oh, X fraternity is prone to sexual violence against women’ leads to adversity in our mission.”</p>\n<p>According to Sigma Pi Herald and third-year biology and economics double major Austen Mauch, the UCSB Greek community stands against sexual violence and is actively trying to reverse the negative stigma surrounding fraternities and rape culture.</p>\n<p>“Sadly, I do know that statistically 1 in 6 women are a victim of sexual assault, every two minutes someone in America is raped and 1 in 4 college-age women will be sexually assaulted during their time in school,” Mauch said. “Sexual assault is more than just a ‘Greek’ issue. It is a human issue. Even one case of sexual assault is one too many … We wanted to bring this issue to the forefront of everyone’s mind so together, everywhere, we can change the violent culture we unfortunately see today.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said UCSB is not the only university where sexual violence occurs and that altering people’s perspectives can be a first step toward changing the campus environment.</p>\n<p>“Many people do not understand the struggle that others have to endure,” Mauch said.  “By taking the opportunity to walk in someone else’s shoes maybe we can begin to understand what others are subjected to … Until everyone, every brother and sister, son and daughter, mother and father, friend and neighbor, can walk alone with no fear of sexual violence we haven’t done enough. Until everyone can go anywhere at any time without fear of sexual violence we have not done enough.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>If even only one person we saw walking down Pardall changed how they saw fraternities here at UCSB, we did a fantastic job and should continue to push our solidarity for the safety and comfort of women in similar ways. – Third-year biology major Kevin Duong</p></blockquote>\n<p>Duong said the event was successful if even one person changed his or her opinion on fraternities.</p>\n<p>“One thing to note is that sometimes events like these don’t feel like it was ‘successful’ but in my eyes, even if one person was swayed to change their opinion then it was successful,” Duong said. “If even only one person we saw walking down Pardall changed how they saw fraternities here at UCSB, we did a fantastic job and should continue to push our solidarity for the safety and comfort of women in similar ways.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said while it was difficult walking in high heels, this was his favorite part of the event because it allowed him to better relate to those who choose to wear them.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely an eye-opening experience,” Mauch said. “It was incredibly difficult and tiring and made me truly appreciate what women and men go through when choosing to wear heels. I believe the event went very well, and through our constant chanting on the walk of ‘listen, believe, support’ definitely drew most people’s attention and hopefully inspired some inquiry into sexual violence awareness and prevention.”</p>\n<p>According to Duong, the students participating in the walk received positive support from bystanders as they marched through I.V. toward Embarcadero Hall.</p>\n<p>“My favorite part was actually when we started entering I.V. past the Pardall Tunnel and our entire group started chanting, ‘listen, believe, support’ while doing our walk,” Duong said. “It showed that we not only were men who could change our footwear for a mile, but that we were willing to, as a collective, voice our concerns for the women in I.V.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said by attending the event, participants made a promise not to be passive bystanders when it comes to preventing sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“They were pledging to stop sexual violence, and that any and every time they see anything questionable anywhere, they will not stand idle,” Mauch said. “We need the culture to change. We need everyone to speak out, stand up and not let the violence continue.”</p>\n<p>According to Kappa Sigma Grand Master Guillermo “Memo” Llamas, the event went through multiple stages of planning.</p>\n<p>“Preparing the event required filling out forms, reserving the plaza, making posters and signs, and spreading the word to invite as many individuals as possible to the event,” Llamas said. “Leading up to the event there were several educational workshops geared towards improving sexual violence awareness.”</p>\n<p>Mauch said his fraternity chose to host Walk a Mile in Her Shoes to fulfill the community service requirement which all Sigma Pi chapters must complete because he thought it could make a significant impact.</p>\n<p>“The high heels were supposed to symbolize the struggles of women and anyone who identifies as a woman,” Mauch said. “Having a group not accustomed to the struggles of women would have an opportunity to walk a mile from their perspective. It’s the best way for more individuals to begin to understand some of the struggles that women face.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Storke Plaza as a final event for their Armenian Genocide Centennial Commemoration Week.</p>\n<p>ASA held a weeklong event beginning this past Monday to educate students and the campus community about the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians beginning April 24, 1915, as well as the struggle for the Armenian community to receive United Nations recognition of the genocide years after the massacres occurred. During the Candlelight Vigil at Storke Plaza there will be a moment of silence to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe the fact that Obama is not accepting the Armenian genocide for what it was, which is a genocide, is honestly political cowardice. – Vice President of the Armenian Student Association Alexander Atamian</p></blockquote>\n<p>Vice President of the Armenian Student Association and third-year biology major Alexander Atamian described the event as a week of remembrance for the genocide, which he said occurred under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for eight years during the start of World War I.</p>\n<p>“Every year we have an Armenian Genocide commemoration week and it’s in order to remember the 1.5 million Armenians that were massacred in 1915 to 1923 by the Ottoman regime at the time,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>Atamian said U.S. Senators oftentimes only say they will acknowledge the 1915 massacres as a genocide in order to gain political support from the Armenian community, and then often do not completely follow through.</p>\n<p>“At this point I believe it’s just a political and strategic tactic that senators are using in order to get all of the Armenian votes because they know how strongly Armenians feel about the situation,” Atamian said. “I believe the fact that Obama is not accepting the Armenian genocide for what it was, which is a genocide, is honestly political cowardice.”</p>\n<p>According to Atamian, in order to prevent future genocides it is necessary for the global community to recognize all past genocides that have occurred, particularly the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“There are other genocides in the world that are happening every day and we need to step up morally and defend those who are being massacred,” Atamian said. “In order for there to not be future genocides we need to acknowledge and accept the ones that have occurred — the first one of the 20th century being the Armenian Genocide.”</p>\n<p>Atamian said ASA integrated other ethnic groups in their commemoration this year in acknowledgement that other groups were also massacred during the time of the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“This year we did something different where we had a Assyrian individual approach us and asked us if we would also share their story as well in our commemoration, which we did … because during that time others were annihilated,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>According to Atamian, as a part of the Armenian Genocide commemoration week, ASA put up a miniature version of the Armenian Genocide Memorial across from Storke to represent the 12 provinces that belonged to Armenia before the genocide occurred.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The consensus of historians who study genocide say that what happened … in 1915, where a million-and-a-half people probably died, fits anybody’s definition of genocide. – Professor Paul Spickard</p></blockquote>\n<p>“[What] we started to do last year was put up the silver memorial along with the 12 slabs … it’s basically a miniature of the Armenian Genocide memorial that is in Yerevan, which is the capital of Armenia … the 12 slabs representing the 12 provinces that belonged to historical Armenia,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>Paul Spickard, a professor who focuses on 20th-century U.S. social and cultural history, said although some historians disagree, most historians have come to a consensus that admits the Armenian Genocide fits the definition of a “genocide.”</p>\n<p>“The consensus of historians who study genocide say that what happened … in 1915, where a million-and-a-half people probably died, fits anybody’s definition of genocide,” Spickard said. “That’s the consensus of historians but there are historians who disagree with that.”</p>\n<p>Spickard also said the Armenian Genocide fits the United Nations’ definition of genocide because it was a direct attempt to annihilate the Armenian population.</p>\n<p>“It was clearly ethnically directed and that’s one of the criteria for genocide,” Spickard said. “When the United Nations was founded they came up with a definition for genocide as an attack or attempt to destroy an entire ethnic group and it clearly was that.”</p>\n<p>According to Spickard, because the U.S. is an ally to Turkey and Turkey refuses to admit its past aggressions, the U.S. is in a difficult political situation in regard to identifying the 1915 massacre as a genocide.</p>\n<p>“Turkey is part of NATO, Turkey is one of the major players in Middle-Eastern politics and … of those players they are the only one with a democracy. So they are an ally,” Spickard said. “The United States really needs Turkey to be a strong counterbalance to Iran … [and] Turkey doesn’t want to face their reality.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year cultural anthropology major and member of cultural sorority Alpha Gamma Alpha Vicki Deirboghossian said many people outside of the Armenian community participated in the event “Handprint Against Genocide” on this past Tuesday to show their support for students advocated for Armenian genocide recognition.</p>\n<p>“At Handprints Against Genocide … from what I observed a lot of people that weren’t Armenian or weren’t associated [with ASA] actually did participate,” Deirboghossian said.</p>\n<p>Deirboghossian said it is rewarding to see others at the university care about the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“It’s cool to see, being at a primarily white multicultural university and finding that people actually do care, it’s very rewarding,” Deirboghossian said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Katrine Lalaian said it is important for students to be aware of the Armenian Genocide because after a century many people do not know it even occurred.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really important thing … since it’s our centennial and a lot of people don’t even know what it is,” Lalaian said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/","id":2799,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[2798,2797,2796],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Covers Deltopia Stats, Food Bank, UCen","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Paris-Cullen-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Paris-Cullen-11.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Associated Students Senate met last night in the UCen’s Flying “A” Room to discuss Deltopia crime statistics, A.S.

Food Bank funding and events to commemorate the anniversary of the May 23rd tragedy.</p>\n<p>During yesterday’s meeting Senators passed a “Bill to Re-Envision the Role of the Internal Vice President” and sent “A Resolution to Support the Mental Health Services Act,” “A Bill to Update Policy 37 Media and Publicity,” “A Bill to Define the Special Elections Process for Spring 2015,” “A Resolution in Support of A.S. Food Bank as a Food Center” and “A Bill to Update the Eligibility of EOP Grants” for review by the University Affairs Committee.  The senators also introduced several administrative bills and resolutions regarding A.S. Legal Code, sending them to committee for review.</p>\n<p>UCPD Lt. Mark Signa updated the senators on Deltopia crime statistics and said there were 206 citations issued and 145 arrests made during the festivities. Thirty-five of those arrested were UCSB students, 15 were SBCC students and 95 were unaffiliated with either school.</p>\n<p>According to Signa, although the number of arrests was “moderately high,” a reduction in medical emergencies and violence proved to be a positive change from last year’s Deltopia. Signa said the success of this year’s Deltopia occurred due to the concerted effort of students and community members to host alternative events and keep it local.</p>\n<p>“The only thing I contribute success to is actually not law enforcement, but student efforts and the community and people coming together to make this a successful event,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa also said UCPD aims to reduce the number of officers deployed during Deltopia in the future, but that any reduction would be based on circumstances.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s the general goal of all of this: to reduce the number of officers,” Signa said. “This year we had about 220 officers throughout the day … I think that’s definitely something we can look into reducing.”</p>\n<p>Zach Goulhiane, UCen Governance Board member, Senator and third-year chemistry and political science double major, told the Senate that Kaplan Inc.’s lease on their space in the UCen is ending soon and UCen administrators are weighing their options for how to use the space.</p>\n<p>“Their contract ends in October 2016 so they’re trying to decide whether to use that space as still Kaplan or have someone else rent that spot,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank Student Chair Katie Freeze, Vice Chair Erick Lankey and Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen  gave a presentation to the Senate to encourage the Senate to pass “A Resolution in Support of the AS Food Bank as a Food Center,” which seeks funding to expand the Food Bank’s services.</p>\n<p>“The idea we came up with is expansion of educational programs, such as conference outreach,” Freeze said. “And ideally we want a community food center and a demonstrations kitchen where students can go if they don’t have access to a kitchen.”</p>\n<p>According to Lankey, the campus’ grant of $75,000 for the A.S. Food Bank from UC Global Food Initiative and UC Office of the President (UCOP) ends in 2016, and the organization’s fee initiative ends in 2017. Thus, to continue servicing the volume of students that use the Food Bank, the organization will need additional funding, Lankey said.</p>\n<p>“We are going to need additional funding, ideally from the campus, to give us a base of $150,000,” Lankey said. “The idea is that we have $75,000 from lock-in and then a match of $75,000 to be provided.”</p>\n<p>Lankey said the food bank currently services about 2,500 students and is projected to serve 3,000 students by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>According to Freeze, receiving additional funding will help the food bank improve their services and thus work toward their goal to reduce the number of food bank-reliant students.</p>\n<p>“We’ll be able to provide higher quality food for our students in the long run,” Freeze said. “More culturally-appropriate food at our bank as well.”</p>\n<p>Freeze also said the A.S. Food Bank is collaborating with other campus organizations for the Edible Campus Project, an endeavor started by alumnus and musician Jack Johnson and his wife Kim that aims to eliminate local food insecurity, co-led by the Food Bank, the A.S. Department of Public Worms and UCSB Sustainability.</p>\n<p>“Another thing we’re looking to do is to increase food production,” Freeze said. “We are in partnership with the Department of Worms and UC Sustainability to start on-campus gardens.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Community Adviser Diana Collins Puente discussed the upcoming two-week campaign for the anniversary of the May 23rd Isla Vista tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Many efforts are underway at UCSB and Isla Vista to commemorate the anniversary and give the community the spaces in which to come together in healing,” Puente said.</p>\n<p>Events will include a candle light vigil, a march to Del Playa, a paddle out held by the Surf Club, the opening of Isla Vista’s Love and Remembrance Garden and the lighting project, amongst others.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/senate-covers-deltopia-stats-food-bank-ucen/","id":2800,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2799,2798,2797],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
