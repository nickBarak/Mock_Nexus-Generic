The two-time All-Big West First Teamer took matters into her own hands leading the Gauchos’ offensive attack with 17 kills.</p>\n<p>Adding to the scoring firepower provided by Barbeau was junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield. Her nine kills helped UCSB to further establish its offensive presence, but it was her aggressiveness on the defensive end that was most significant. Sheffield’s three blocks were vital in the team holding the Wolverines to a .103 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>While Utah Valley State’s offense was unable to produce, it was the Wolverines’ defense that kept them in contention.</p>\n<p>Leading Utah Valley State’s defensive barrier was the duo of junior outside hitter Kiahna Steiner and senior middle blocker Lauren Bakker. The two combined for a total of 15 blocks to help make up for the team’s lack of offense.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines nearly avoided the UCSB sweep in the match’s third set, but could not capitalize on their lead. Utah Valley State went on a 5-0 run during the last set, and eventually gained a 24-22 lead due to some late-game UCSB errors. Despite trailing, a rally of kills and a service ace by senior defensive specialist Shauna Klein led to the Gauchos’ 26-24 comeback to end the game.</p>\n<p>It was a similar scenario in the Gauchos second match versus Incarnate Word. While Barbeau and Sheffield continued their dominance on the court, senior opposites Jaylen Villanueva and Britton Taylor emerged with solid showings as well. Villanueva led the Gauchos with nine digs as Taylor’s eight kills gave her a game-high .429 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>After losing former UCSB setter Ali Santi, there was some concern if the Gauchos could fill that void. Through two games, redshirt senior Hanna Nielson and freshman Annie Hasselmann have proven that the Gauchos’ core of their rotation will be just fine.</p>\n<p>Hasselmann’s play has shown that her many accolades and milestones entering UCSB are well deserved as she finished day one of the Classic with 31 assists, just two behind Nielson’s 33.In spite of a strong start by the Cardinals in the match’s first two sets, the abundance of errors made by Incarnate Word were too much to recover from.</p>\n<p>Even a game-high of 12 kills by senior outside hitter Angelique Vidaurri was not enough to overcome the Cardinals’ mistakes. However, UCSB’s defense must be applauded as well as it held Incarnate Word to a .074 hitting percentage. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, their inefficiencies on offense led to a third set that resulted in 11 errors and 11 kills for a .000 kill percentage.</p>\n<p>As UCSB and Pepperdine both finished Friday unbeaten, Saturday consisted of two of the tournament’s best teams going head-to-head.</p>\n<p>While the two teams traded the match’s first two sets, a costly third set which resulted in 10 Gaucho errors led to the Waves winning 3-1 with scores of 25-18, 16-25, 25-19, and 25-16 to win the Asics Classic and improve to an overall record of 3-0.</p>\n<p>The Waves’ young trio of freshman middle blocker Tarah Wylie, freshman outside hitters Heidi Dyer and Nikki Lyons carried the load for Pepperdine as they combined for a total of 34 kills. However, it was the hustle play of players such as senior setter Becca Strehlow and Dyer that contributed to the Waves securing the last two sets as Strehlow had 22 digs while Dyer recorded 16.</p>\n<p>UCSB freshman defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi put on her best performance as she had a game-high 30 digs. Still, while UCSB had an outstanding second set in which it hit .487 percent, the Gauchos lack of consistency cost themselves the game as they averaged a .197 hitting percentage for the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB will participate in the Yale Invitational this Friday, Sept. 4<sup>th</sup> to face Rice at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64605\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-31/womens-volleyball-sweep-two-drop-one-in-season-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64605\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-31/womens-volleyball-sweep-two-drop-one-in-season-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-31/womens-volleyball-sweep-two-drop-one-in-season-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-31/womens-volleyball-sweep-two-drop-one-in-season-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-31/womens-volleyball-sweep-two-drop-one-in-season-opener/","id":5120,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5119,5118,5117],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"No. 6 UCSB Falls to First Place UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/water-polo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/water-polo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB ends its regular season on a three-game losing skid.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 6 UCSB men’s water polo team fell to No. 3 UCLA with a final score of 10-7 in its last conference game of the season this weekend.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara maintains its No. 6 ranking with an overall record of 16-9, and a conference record of 3-5, and the Bruins advance to first-place with an overall mark of 26-2 and a conference record of 6-1.

One goal from sophomore attacker Kevin Cappon and two from senior attacker Matt Gronow put the Gauchos ahead 3-2. Shortly after, UCLA drew an exclusion penalty against UCSB and one of the leading Bruins offensive players in junior attacker Paul Reynolds tied the game at 3-3.</p>\n<p>The second period began with three consecutive offensive possessions for the Gauchos, but it was UCLA that was able to put the first goal on the board. This scoring momentum continued and UCLA opened the second period with three goals, holding UCSB scoreless. With one minute left in the period, sophomore two-meter Nicholas Jordan broke the dry spell for the Gauchos, bringing the score to 6-4.</p>\n<p>Another quick attack from the Bruins opened the third quarter, giving them a dramatic four-goal lead with a score of 8-4. Jordan was able to deliver another important goal late in the game for the Gauchos, giving him his 26th of the season, and bringing the Gauchos within reach.</p>\n<p>“It was exciting,” Jordan said. “I was just trying to do what I could for the team, but I give credit to my teammates for setting me up for those goals.”</p>\n<p>UCSB found an offensive rhythm late in the game, closing the gap against UCLA. Senior utility Bryce Miller and junior attacker Eric Van De Mortel each scored, bringing the count to 9-7.</p>\n<p>In the fourth quarter, it appeared that the Gauchos were gaining confidence with each possession. They were pressuring on the counter attack, and forcing UCLA to make mistakes. As a result, UCSB was given a power play opportunity, but UCLA’s freshman goalkeeper Garrett Danner denied the goal. With 3:30 left in the game, Reynolds delivered a lob shot over Whitelegge’s head and secured the Bruins’ victory with a final score of 10-7.</p>\n<p>“It was good. We made some mistakes and we paid for that, but overall we did pretty well,” Whitelegge said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end their season on a three-game losing streak, but have plenty of positives to move forward from.</p>\n<p>“Our effort level and heart were definitely here, we just need to focus on playing 30 full seconds of defense,” Whitelegge said. “We will be able to take care of that, it’s looking good for the MPSF conference.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to Stockton for the MPSF tournament in two weeks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 18, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The first time they met at the NorCal Tournament in late September, UCSB won by a final score of 5-4, and more recently at the SoCal tournament, UCSB defeated Long Beach in a dramatic overtime ending with a score of 8-6.</p>\n<p>“We beat Long Beach twice, but we struggled on the power play the last time we played them,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “That has been a main focus this week in practice.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has yet to play USC this season, but it will likely be a challenging game at home as the Trojans head into Gaucho territory with momentum, having won nine straight games.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t played USC, which is a good and bad thing,” Wigo said. “It’s tough that they are number one, but also we really need that extra motivation going into the game.”</p>\n<p>In order to remain undefeated over Long Beach, the Gauchos will have to maintain a strong and consistent defense throughout the entire game. In their most recent match against the 49ers, the Gauchos took an early lead but allowed the 49ers to score in the third and fourth quarter, sending the game into overtime. The two Long Beach players that pose the biggest threat offensively are leading scorers sophomore defender Zacchary Kappos with 37 on the year, and sophomore attacker Nolan McConnell with 30 on the year.</p>\n<p>“For Long Beach we know how we can beat them and what we need to do, we just need to concentrate and keep our minds right,” junior attacker Eric Van de Mortel said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face another strong offense against USC which is currently averaging 17 goals a game. Sophomore goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge will serve as the rock for UCSB’s defense as it faces two leading scorers who have amounted over 50 goals each this season. USC’s senior driver Nikola Vavic has 57 goals and junior driver Kostas Genidounias has 53 goals on the season.</p>\n<p>To be victorious this weekend, UCSB will need to play strong defense against Long Beach, and then return to Santa Barbara ready to rack up the goals against high scoring USC.</p>\n<p>It is still early on in the MPSF conference games, but UCSB is tied for third place with a split record of 1-1 with Stanford and Cal. USC is currently ranked in second place with a record of 1-0 and Long Beach is ranked sixth with a record of 0-0, not having played any conference games yet.</p>\n<p>When asked about the team’s goals for this weekend and beyond, Van de Mortel said, “We never want to put an NCAA championship out of our minds; that would be the ultimate goal.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game against Long Beach will start at noon at the 49er Campus Pool and Sunday’s home game against USC will also begin at noon at UCSB’s Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 6 and 7 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kevin Yang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52612\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/no-6-gauchos-face-no-7-long-beach-state-on-the-road-host-no-1-usc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52612\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/no-6-gauchos-face-no-7-long-beach-state-on-the-road-host-no-1-usc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/no-6-gauchos-face-no-7-long-beach-state-on-the-road-host-no-1-usc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/no-6-gauchos-face-no-7-long-beach-state-on-the-road-host-no-1-usc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/no-6-gauchos-face-no-7-long-beach-state-on-the-road-host-no-1-usc/","id":5118,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5117,5116,5115],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 6 UCSB Defeats No. 7 Long Beach, Falls to No. 1 USC","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WaterPolo11_KevinYang_10.05.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WaterPolo11_KevinYang_10.05.2013.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB split a pair of weekend matches against ranked opponents.

UCSB answered back with a quick goal from sophomore attacker Kevin Cappon, followed by another Trojan goal. Cappon responded by scoring his second goal of the day and then senior attacker Matt Gronow followed with two consecutive goals to bring the Gauchos within reach. The back and forth offense of the first period ended in a close 6-4 Trojans lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s strong offensive momentum carried into the second period, but it was equally countered by USC’s quick offensive return. Cappon scored his third goal of the game, and junior attacker Eric Van de Mortel scored two goals of his own, one resulting from a rebounded penalty shot. The second period ended with another close score of 9-7.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game slowed down offensively with the Gauchos scoring only three goals in comparison to USC’s seven. Van de Mortel put two more points on the board, and Cappon scored another goal in the final quarter giving them both a total of four goals each for the game. USC’s leading scorer, senior two-meter Connor Virjee, scored five goals total, contributing to the Trojans 16-10 win.</p>\n<p>“There are definitely some positives, we shot the ball really well today,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “Nobody has scored more than 12 goals against us all season, so that is disappointing.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game at Long Beach had a more promising result with a strong offensive attack early on, and a final score of 9-6.</p>\n<p>“This weekend was big, especially Saturday. It clinched us in the top six of our conference so we won’t find ourselves in a dogfight later on,” Cappon said.</p>\n<p>Long Beach jumped out in front with the first goal of the game. Less than a minute later Van de Mortel made UCSB’s offensive presence known, tying the game 1-1. Within the first half of the game, two goals each from Van de Mortel and Cappon, and a single goal from senior attacker Matt Gronow and sophomore attacker Ryan Baliani gave the Gauchos a 7-3 lead.</p>\n<p>A low scoring third quarter allowed for the UCSB defense to shine. Long Beach was able to score one goal, but UCSB sophomore goalkeeper Chris Whitelegge dominated the attention with a remarkable penalty block. Each team scored two goals in the fourth quarter, but the Gauchos secured the win with a final score of 9-6. Van de Mortel led the Gauchos with three goals total.</p>\n<p>Whitelegge continues to lead the Gaucho defense, registering 10 saves in each game this weekend and 218 saves on the season.</p>\n<p>Long Beach now holds a record of 17-6 overall and 1-1 in conference while the USC Trojans add to their dominant record of 20-1 overall and 2-0 in conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues play Saturday against UC Irvine at noon at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 28, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kevin Yang of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52641\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/52641/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52641\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/52641/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/52641/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/52641/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/52641/","id":5119,"author":{"id":227,"name":"Hayley Johnson"},"related":[5118,5117,5116],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
