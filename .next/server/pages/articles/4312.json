There was one incident involving an opioid-related overdose, during which SBSO administered Narcan.</p>\n<p>According to SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover, there were two separate cases where a partygoer fell off a balcony due to intoxication. Neither incident resulted in major injuries.</p>\n<p>Two of the arrests that occurred on Saturday involved <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-09/two-handguns-confiscated-over-deltopia-weekend/\">handguns</a>. In the first incident SBSO arrested Briton Barge, 23, after he allegedly used a 0.40 caliber pistol to threaten two victims while searching for his stolen backpack.</p>\n<p>SBSO also arrested Tristian Gilford, 24, after Gilford was pulled over for having “faulty lighting equipment” on his car. Police officers then found a .25 caliber pistol hidden inside of his car and arrested him.</p>\n<p>According to SBSO, the crowds began dwindling around 6 p.m. when the Outdoor Festival Ordinance, which bans any live or recorded music heard outside residences, went into effect. The crowds eventually dissipated when students left I.V. to attend The Warm Up concert at the Thunderdome sponsored by Associated Students Program Board.</p>\n<p>“This year we did see more out-of-towners, and we did obviously see an increase in medical transports,” Hoover said. “But for the most part, people were pretty respectful of law enforcement and there weren’t any major problems other than the medical transports we talked about.”</p>\n<p>According to arrest logs from April 5 to April 8, out-of-towners made up 49 percent of Deltopia arrests.

Community Services District (CSD), said that with the exception of several parking restrictions, it was “a day like any other.”</p>\n<p>The day after Deltopia festivities, 60 volunteers assembled at Adopt-A-Block’s annual Deltopia Cleanup Sunday morning to pick up 776 pounds of trash. According to Adopt-A-Block Supervisor Raymond Willefert, the amount of street waste he observed this year was similar to last year’s.</p>\n<p>“Deltopia has certainly quieted down in the last few years, and fortunately we’re not seeing widespread trashing of the community and environment on the scale that was experienced prior to 2015,” Willefert said in an email.</p>\n<p>“There was a significant amount of trash on Del Playa Drive this morning when I got to work. The 6600 block in particular was hit pretty hard, but fortunately nothing we couldn’t handle,” he explained.</p>\n<p>According to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the university spent between $25,000 and $30,000 on ads to deter out-of-towners from attending Deltopia. In previous years, the university has spent up to $40,000.</p>\n<p>The university also spent approximately $5,000 to put up fencing on El Colegio Road. The university faced backlash from students and the CSD regarding their decision to put up fencing this year, despite a formal request from the CSD to reconsider.</p>\n<p>CSD Board President Ethan Bertrand said the CSD coordinated with local law enforcement and had a contract with the UCPD to deploy Community Service Officers (CSOs) during the day to help keep people safe.</p>\n<p>“I’m very glad that it was a relatively safe event,” Bertrand said. “On that note, I’m really happy to see a continued reduction in arrests and citations. However, I am concerned about this year’s increase in medical calls, and it just shows us how important it is to continue to work to make this event safer.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand added that moving forward, there should be considerations about creating a “more sustainable event,” which brings together locals, community organizations and businesses.</p>\n<p>“Right now, we have a bunch of people who are roaming around on Del Playa with no plans,” Bertrand said. “If we can bring some more fun and safe activities to Isla Vista on this day and really incorporate local businesses into it, I think that we can have a much safer and more positive event.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/deltopia-attendance-medical-emergencies-rise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/deltopia-attendance-medical-emergencies-rise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/deltopia-attendance-medical-emergencies-rise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/deltopia-attendance-medical-emergencies-rise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/deltopia-attendance-medical-emergencies-rise/","id":4310,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[4309,4308,4307],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Trading Post Brings Sustainable Fashion to Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2018-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/doggo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/doggo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"When Brooke Rothfield learned about the human rights abuses occurring in Bangladesh sweatshops, she felt compelled to help combat the effects of fast fashion.

After their first thrifting event with EAB, they participated in the Isla Vista Open Market, a flea market that hosts events at Little Acorn Park.<em> Courtesy of Isla Vista Trading Post</em></p></div>\n<p>Patrons of the trading post can take three pieces of clothing from the pop-up shops, free of charge.</p>\n<p>The founders see no reason to make a profit off of their passion for thrifting, instead hoping that their “three for free” rule will encourage people to pay their efforts forward and choose to donate their old clothes at a future event if they wish.</p>\n<p>Rothfield, a fourth-year communication major, initially pitched the idea for the trading post as a project for one of her communication classes in the fall.</p>\n<p>“Our project was to come up with something that would help the community, so I pitched this idea for something sustainable and fashion-oriented,” she said.</p>\n<p>Rothfield was inspired by the “free box” in Isla Vista, which are bins full of free clothing outside the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District building.</p>\n<p>The founders of the trading post planned their first pop-up thrift shop during Fall Quarter, but when the Thomas Fire hit Santa Barbara County, plans for the event were abandoned.</p>\n<p>The delay, as well as Rothfield’s graduation from UC Santa Barbara, left the future of the trading post up in the air.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sofia Willis, who now runs IVTP with Forsell, wanted to bring thrifting to Isla Vista, but lacked the means.</p>\n<p>Willis, a second-year philosophy and sociology double major, initially got involved in thrifting through the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB), taking to the Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page to round up clothing donations.</p>\n<p>Through Facebook she met Rothfield and Forsell, whose vision for the Isla Vista Trading Post matched her own and the three branched off to reinvigorate the project.</p>\n<p>“I wanted this to be not just about the environment, but also community, and fashion and self-expression, which is the direction [the project] was going in as well,” Willis said.</p>\n<p>To reach a larger scope of the surrounding community, the trading post decided to host its pop-up shop in Isla Vista rather than on campus. After their first thrifting event with EAB, they participated in the Isla Vista Open Market, a flea market that hosts events at Little Acorn Park.</p>\n<p>With shops hosted by student artists and vintage clothing curators, Rothfield thought the trading post would be a natural addition to the market.</p>\n<p>Forsell and Willis agree that they want to educate people about the human rights violations in the fast fashion industry and cited sustainability as the primary goal of the trading post.</p>\n<p>“We like to say that the fast fashion industry is the second dirtiest industry in the world,” Forsell said.</p>\n<p>They said, however, that their mission does not have a political agenda.</p>\n<p>The organization is comprised of approximately 15 dedicated students, five of whom hold official administrative positions. The volunteers meet on Wednesday nights to plan thrifting events, collect donations and postulate about the future of the rapidly-growing trading post.</p>\n<p>Ultimately one of the main goals of the Isla Vista Trading Post is to normalize thrift shopping and to welcome all people who are interested. Willis believes that thrift shopping currently belongs to a very specific group of people, which she hopes to destigmatize.</p>\n<p>“Right now it seems like thrifting belongs to a very niche group, sort of, and it’s not like everybody thrifts because it’s fashionable or cool, it’s kind of just a niche group that does it,” Forsell explained.</p>\n<p>Willis and Forsell said the next major step is to apply for nonprofit status in order to receive funding from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>\n<p>They are hopeful that with this funding they will be able to buy a storage unit, as they have currently been storing the enormous amounts of leftover clothes in their cars.</p>\n<p>While the trading post is a nonprofit organization, Willis, Forsell, Rothfield and the other members of their team have all paid out of pocket to get the organization off the ground. Willis said she sees the organization as an “investment” and hopes of one day buying a van and a storage unit.</p>\n<p>They also hope to plan a raffle for some of the high value items they have received as donations and would like to host an art show in conjunction with student artists and local businesses.</p>\n<p>In the short term, Willis and Forsell are looking forward to collaborating with WORD Magazine, Surfrider Foundation and the sustainability chairs of Greek life organizations as part of the Greeks Go Green initiative in order to bring the trading post to as many places as they can.</p>\n<p>“We’d like to expand past Isla Vista and inspire other college campuses and communities,” Forsell said. “And if this generation can get used to trading clothes, then future generations will start doing that.”</p>\n<p>“‘Remember when people used to buy clothes instead of trading them?’ That’s my dream, to be able to say that to my kids,” Willis said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the May 3 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.
