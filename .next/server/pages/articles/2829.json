Senate in the Old Little Theater and Girvetz 1004, making speeches to the senators concerning the Students for Justice in Palestine’s recent resolution. <em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met Wednesday night in the Old Little Theater and then in Girvetz 1004 to discuss a resolution by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), sponsored by senators Xin Ma and Steven Kwok, which calls for the university to divest from businesses profiting from alleged human rights violations in Palestine.</p>\n<p>Dozens of students signed up to speak during public forum, giving passionate arguments both in support and in opposition of the resolution. UCSB and UC Merced remain the only UC undergraduate campuses whose student governments have not yet passed divestment resolutions, with UC Irvine being the first campus to pass divestment in November 2012.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This resolution never took into account that boycotting businesses affects business decisions that hurt the Palestinians as much if not more than the Israeli economy. Hewlett-Packard, one of the companies on the boycott list, employees hundreds of Palestinians engineers and other people in the technology industry.” – Second-year economics and accounting major Michael Torbati</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sociology graduate student Emily Schneider said students should stand in opposition to the corporations profiting from human rights violations currently being committed via the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>“The problem there is not so much about religion, or other things that we see in the media, but the fact that there’s companies over there profiting off of the cycle of violence and we have the chance here as students to play a role in ending the cycle of violence for both Israelis and Palestinians,” Schneider said.</p>\n<p>Daniel Lifton, president of Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi, said that the Palestinian Civil Society’s international call for a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has unreasonable demands that target Israel’s existence.</p>\n<p>“The demands that BDS calls for amount to the destruction of Israel it’s as simple as that,” Lifton said. “The generally agreed upon solution to this conflict is a peaceful two-state solution. I want peace; I want an Israeli state, and I want a Palestinian state.”</p>\n<p>First-year global studies major Marjan Abubu said he is in support of the resolution and called on Senate to stand up on behalf of people oppressed by corporations named in the resolution.</p>\n<p>“We have the power to voice our opinions therefore we must speak out for those who cannot,” Abubu said. “Our unified voices cry out to denounce corporations that profit from cruelty and brutality.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Michael Torbati said the resolution is an attack on Israel and may have unintended consequences.</p>\n<p>“Israeli existence is questioned daily. No other nation has to deal with the constant threat of annihilation from multiple fronts. It may not seem like it, but we are standing at one of these fronts right now,” Torbati said. “This resolution never took into account that boycotting businesses affects business decisions that hurt the Palestinians as much if not more than the Israeli economy. Hewlett-Packard, one of the companies on the boycott list, employees hundreds of Palestinians engineers and other people in the technology industry.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I saw most of you running for platforms advocating for campus and social change. You all stand at a crossroads of continuing a tradition of activism and social justice that is the very reason that many of you can sit at these seats today. – Second-year math major Alonso Martinez</p></blockquote>\n<p>First-year biology major Michelle May said if the resolution were passed, it would alienate the campus’s large Jewish student population.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has the largest Jewish population of any UC, therefore clearly the Jewish community feels comfortable being here and discussing that they are Jewish,” May said.</p>\n<p>“This resolution alienates the Jewish community. There is no reason to pass a resolution that diminishes the happiness of such a large student population.”</p>\n<p>Second-year math major Alonso Martinez encouraged the Senate to pass the divestment resolution near the end of public forum by putting the BDS movement into the historical context of past social justice struggles.</p>\n<p>“As George William, a German philosopher once said, ‘The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history.’ Will you be the Senators that prove him wrong?” Martinez asked.</p>\n<p>Martinez said the opportunity to pass the divestment resolution was in the tradition of past student-initiated changes such as Black Student Union’s call for changes to the ethnic studies program to accurately reflect the UC demographic and protests against UC complicity with the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>“I saw most of you running for platforms advocating for campus and social change,” Martinez said. “You all stand at a crossroads of continuing a tradition of activism and social justice that is the very reason that many of you can sit at these seats today.”</p>\n<p>As of press time, no vote had been made on the resolution.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on the page 6 of Thursday, April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-senate-dives-into-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-senate-dives-into-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-senate-dives-into-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-senate-dives-into-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-senate-dives-into-divestment/","id":2829,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2828,2827,2826],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Sunday Funday: Second Half Standouts","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In the stock market, you can make a fortune by selling high and buying low.

The same rule applies in fantasy football. With the tail end of the season coming up, it’s time to think about bettering your team for the home stretch.</p>\n<p>A few things can define the player that you are looking for to improve your team. A buy-low candidate is a player who has either underachieved thus far or has struggled as of late, but has the potential to break out and finish off the season on a high note. And after all, fantasy seasons are won or lost in these coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Here are some potential buy-low candidates I think can finish out the season strong:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Jahvid Best</p>\n<p>Best has been dealing with a turf toe injury and hasn’t recorded double-digit points or a touchdown since week two, when he had three.</p>\n<p>As we saw on Sunday, with Matthew Stafford back the Lions’ offense is about to become a whole lot better. Best will be a major beneficiary of Stafford’s play mainly because of his pass-catching ability. He is currently second behind Frank Gore in receiving yards by a running back this season. On Sunday, he had five receptions for 31 yards. His game-breaking speed makes him a candidate to take any run or pass to the house, and as the Lions’ offense improves and Best’s toe heals, expect great play from him.</p>\n<p>Ray Rice / Maurice Jones-Drew</p>\n<p>Lots of yards. Few touchdowns. It will certainly be difficult to get this owner to part with his first round pick, but if he is dumb enough to doubt that the scores will come, you should pounce on the opportunity to acquire either of these studs. Baltimore has relied too much on Joe Flacco and the passing offense, but will soon discover its identity as a run-first football team, with Rice being the main beneficiary.</p>\n<p>Jones-Drew may be harder to trade for, but his value will only go up from here on out. Just remember, down the stretch depth matters less and less. If you are looking to make a run for the playoffs, it’s all about your starting lineup, so even if you have to give up multiple players to acquire him, it will be worth it. The constant yardage guarantees steady production, and both Rice and Jones-Drew are guaranteed to touch the ball a certain number of times because they are vital to their teams’ offensive success.</p>\n<p>Knowshon Moreno</p>\n<p>Moreno’s value has been up and down all season, and he is just recently overcoming a hamstring injury that sidelined him for three games earlier in the year. Moreno is by far the most talented player in a crowded Denver backfield and will show that in the coming weeks. Much like Best, his pass-catching ability makes him a great buy-low candidate, even if you don’t fully believe in his ability to run the football.</p>\n<p>The Broncos have a bye in week nine, so this may be the perfect time to target Moreno. Assuming Moreno will be healthy in week 10, Denver has a cupcake schedule heading down the stretch. They play St. Louis in week 12, before a fantasy-friendly playoff schedule of Arizona, Oakland and Houston in weeks 14-16.</p>\n<p>DeSean Jackson</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter who is playing quarterback for the Eagles — DeSean will get his. Jackson has actually put up better fantasy numbers with Vick at the helm, so this is good news with Vick set to start this week.</p>\n<p>The problem is Jackson’s health. He is still recovering from a brutal concussion and may not be ready to play this week. View this as a good thing. If you can convince his owner that he is not worth the trouble and trade for him on the discount, go for it. Once healthy, Jackson is a great #1 receiver with huge play potential, as he is another guy with game-breaking speed who can always take one to the house.</p>\n<p>Wes Welker</p>\n<p>He has 40 receptions through seven games this season — below his pace of over 110 receptions in each of his last three seasons (his first three with the Pats). He has 319 yards and three touchdowns.</p>\n<p>Brady has not needed to throw the ball lately for the Patriots to have success, but that will change. The Pats are a pass-first team and Welker will play well down the stretch. It is highly possible that he has been slowed down by his surgically repaired knee, but — barring any setbacks — shouldn’t that mean that he will only get better as the season progresses and his knee continues to heal?</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Ryan Porush would like to invite anyone and everyone to come take a look at his crystal ball. It’s very, very shiny.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine by a tiebreaker secret ballot of 13-12-1 after a lengthy eight-hour meeting last night in the Old Little Theater and Givertz 1004.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and accounting major and A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau took the votes on the resolution by secret ballot and gave the tie-breaking “no” vote following the Senate’s initial 12-12 split and one abstention over whether or not to pass the resolution. The failure of the resolution to pass marks the third consecutive year the A.S. Senate has denied passage of a divestment resolution. UCSB and UC Merced remain the only UC campuses whose undergraduate student governments have not passed divestment resolutions, with UC Irvine being the first campus to pass divestment in Nov. 2012.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and SJP member Anumita Kaur co-authored the resolution which calls for the UC Regents, UCSB, Associated Students and the UCSB Foundation to withdraw investments from several companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine. The resolution specifically names Motorola, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman, Caterpillar, Boeing, General Electric and Hewlett-Packard as companies infringing on citizenship rights of those in the region.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Garza, second-year Ph.D candidate in the department of sociology and SJP member, said the organization is disappointed with the outcome of the Senate’s vote.</p>\n<p>“We are frustrated that our Associated Students will go another year being complicit with these human rights violations perpetrated by these companies, but we are also as motivated as ever because … in the way the debate has changed the past few years, we feel that it’s only a matter of time … a global movement like this can’t be stopped by the vote of a handful of A.S. senators,” Garza said.</p>\n<p>Second-year CCS physics major and CCS collegiate senator Liam Stanton, who called for a roll call vote prior to the motion to vote on the resolution, said the secret vote forced Lau to take responsibility for the consequences of the vote.</p>\n<p>“What makes me upset about the result of tonight’s vote wasn’t which side won or lost,” Stanton said. “It was the fact that we didn’t have the courage as public representatives to put our votes out there.”</p>\n<p>Stanton said the tie vote and resulting tiebreaker decided by Lau created an unfortunate situation in which Lau will “almost singularly” receive blame for the decision.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think either side behaved particularly well,” Stanton said. “We instead forced the president of our Senate to put out her vote. She was the only public vote and so all of us got to hide, except for those who announced their vote. She had to take the heat almost singularly for everyone else from the community who feels marginalized now.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and political science double major and off-campus senator Hiro Bower said she called for a secret ballot because she believed it was necessary given the strongly opposing sides on the divestment movement.</p>\n<p>“I called for a secret ballot. That’s why I defended having a secret ballot … people have a lot of very strong opinions about this,” Bower said. “How do you make a decision when you’re considering the entire student body, when the entire student body has two very different sides?”</p>\n<p>According to Bower, situations like divestment increase pressure on A.S. Senators to carry out decisions as representatives of the totality of the student body.</p>\n<p>“So in that case a lot of pressure is put on your shoulders and not everybody is comfortable with facing everybody there because you cannot make a decision without feeling horrible about it,” Bower said. “Yes, that’s like something we took on when we decided to run, we all knew that this was coming … but still, at the end of the day, we’re students.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Michelle Moreh, one of the main senators in opposition to the resolution, said the Israeli West Bank barrier separating Israel and Palestine is necessary because of the ongoing threat of terrorism in Israel.</p>\n<p>“No one is arguing that all Palestinians are terrorists, but how should Israel deal with terrorist organizations that are hiding themselves amongst civilians and using them as a cover to murder Israelis?” Moreh said. “In my opinion, one-sided security shouldn’t come at the expense of others. But this is happening because we have terrorist organizations that have left Israel with really no other way to keep its people safe. When terrorists put their weapons down and their hatred down, the wall comes down.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year mechanical engineering major and engineering collegiate senator Jonathan Rothschild said he did not support the resolution.</p>\n<p>“I cannot applaud the decision for the resolution to not acknowledge a two-state solution,” Rothschild said. “What is so wrong with acknowledging Israel’s right to exist?”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Guy Singer said he was against the resolution because it did not reflect any input from the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“We’ve worked for the past two years to build alternatives and to build roads of cooperation and making out investment system more socially, environmentally and governmentally more responsible, and these efforts have been met with nothing but disdain from the pro-BDS community,” Singer said. “Any divestment resolution in the future will have to incorporate the Jewish community in some way or another in order for it to work.”</p>\n<p>Second-year film and media studies and philosophy double major and Off-campus Senator Jenna Anderson said she supported the resolution, but wanted to see amendments made.</p>\n<p>“As you can see, most every senator has expressed concerns with the wording of this resolution,” Anderson said. “Maybe I’m an idealist, but I just don’t get why we can’t come together and fix certain parts of it just to make it a little bit more inclusive.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said A.S. should look into changes such as including more numbers and looking into investments in other companies that might not be socially responsible.</p>\n<p>“Maybe we could include other countries as well,” Anderson said. “If we are focusing of Palestine then why can’t we add the other companies that we are invested in the other countries and not just focus on Israel?”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year feminist studies and history double major Proxy Senator Andrew Farkash said he supported the resolution as a way for the university to dissociate from a stance that favors one country over another.</p>\n<p>“Our investments as they are right now value Israeli lives over Palestinian lives,” Farkash said. “I think that taking our money out of this issue makes a statement that we don’t support human rights violations, but at some point it is just saying we don’t want our hands involved whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>According to Farkash, it was hard for him to come out as a Jewish student in support of the bill.</p>\n<p>“It is difficult for me to sit here and say that I support this resolution, because I know and acknowledge and am so deeply connected to those histories,” Farkash said. “There are thousands of Jewish people like me who are coming out and saying we love our country, we love our ethnicity, we love our religion, but we don’t love the occupation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The office of EVPLA primarily concerns university and student relations with Isla Vista and the surrounding areas. The EVPLA office negotiates with campus administration regarding parking for Halloween and Deltopia, consults with local law enforcement agencies and distributes important information regarding I.V. and its surrounding areas to the campus community. In a 50-minute debate, the candidates for EVPLA were asked questions about what issues they would address and how they would address them if elected.</p>\n<p>One of the issues brought up during the EVPLA debate was student housing, particularly the high cost of living in I.V.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This used to be an activist community until the ’70s when Reagan came in and pretty much crushed that spirit.

This is something we have been pushing for years because the county is continuing to underserve our community. – Paola Dela Cruz of the Open People’s Party (OPP)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Answering a question about Assemblymember Das Williams’ self-governance bill AB-3, Dela Cruz said she was a strong proponent of the legislation.</p>\n<p>“Since the very first day that Assembly Bill 3 was introduced, I have been part of the dialogues and meetings that have taken place in our local community,” Dela Cruz said. “I am in full support of this bill. I believe that our community needs self-governance in Isla Vista. This is something we have been pushing for years because the county is continuing to underserve our community.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, the structural changes outlined by AB-3 are not enough to incite change in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it is a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t do nearly enough,” Morse said. “I think that it’s a way to appease the students at this particular point in time. What we really need is representation, and the way that we get representation is through cityhood, not through the current structure.”</p>\n<p>In regard to addressing rape culture on campus, Dela Cruz said there have been a lack of programs to educate students about sexual violence at the university and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I will make sure that a yearlong sexual assault campaign is launched in Isla Vista because it is extremely disappointing that our university has never launched a sexual assault campaign,” Dela Cruz said. “I will make sure as the EVPLA I address this.”</p>\n<p>Morse said he wants to bring back the activism culture of I.V. in the ’60s and channel efforts toward anti-rape culture.</p>\n<p>“This used to be an activist community until the ’70s when Reagan came in and pretty much crushed that spirit,” Morse said. “I think that we should foster that activism spirit once again.”</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62393\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1877346452\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62405\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62393\" data-attachment-id=\"62393\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/charles-carlos-lopez-describes-how-ucs-are-unequally-financially-represented/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Charles \\\"Carlos\\\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428970937\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"91\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"Charles \\\"Carlos\\\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"EVPSA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62393\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/EVPSA_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt='EVPSA Candidate Charles \"Carlos\" Lopez describes how UCs are unequally financially represented.

Elections will take place April 20-23 on GOLD.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/evpla-and-evpsa-candidates-debate-student-housing-self-governance-more/","id":2828,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2827,2826,2825],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
