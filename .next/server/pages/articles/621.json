The Anteaters, on the other hand, finished their regular season with a 5-13 league record and a 9-21 overall mark.</p>\n<p>“I told [the seniors] before the game started that we still have a lot of basketball left, but this is a day where the community, the fans and their teammates can show their appreciation of what they’ve meant to this program on and off the court,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “As a coach, I’ll come back and thank them in a year or two. Until then, I’ve still got to ride their butts for three more games and then I’ll think about what the future will be like without them. Until that point, I want them to enjoy this day. It’s a special day.”</p>\n<p>A better beginning to the game could not have been written for the Gauchos, whose seniors came out on fire. On the very first play of the afternoon, senior forward Sweets Underwood came up with a block and Tilleman secured the defensive rebound.</p>\n<p>On the opposite end of the floor, UCSB went straight to its high-low game. A pass from Tilleman to Underwood down low put Santa Barbara up 2-0. The Gauchos’ second basket came on a 15-foot jumper from senior guard Angelei Aguirre. Then, with a layup from Tilleman, UCSB went up 6-0 and very fittingly, all three of UCSB’s seniors had scored.</p>\n<p>“We had it scripted. I don’t know if you guys knew that, but the seniors would score the first three buckets of the game, so it was all a plan,” Mitchell joked after the game. “Once again, I’m brilliant.”</p>\n<p>A baseline jumper from Tilleman put the Gauchos up 10-5 with all 10 points coming from the seniors. However, as both teams settled into the game, turnovers began to plague both sides. 11 combined turnovers in the first 11 minutes of play resulted in a sloppy game with neither team able to establish any sort of rhythm offensively.</p>\n<p>“They play a really high and wide zone, often a 1-3-1,” Tilleman said. “We’ve always struggled with that and we do best when we’re doing transition offense and don’t have to run anything, so I think it just took us a while to respond to that. [Irvine] was our first game of conference play and our last, so I think we improved, but we still have a lot of room to get better against those types of defenses.”</p>\n<p>UCSB went down 10-12, but was down for a total of just 26 seconds as the team finally found its stride, responding with an 8-1 run. However, the Gauchos started missing easy shots, finishing the half on 1-5 shooting. As a result, Santa Barbara entered halftime up by just one point at 20-19.</p>\n<p>“We got a lot of open looks today,” Mitchell said. “Sometimes they don’t fall, but if you continue to be consistent in the other areas you can control, it gives you an opportunity to win like it did tonight.”</p>\n<p>Up two with just over two minutes remaining, UCSB continued to earn itself possessions through hustle plays, keeping control of the ball for 1:15. Tilleman rebounded the ball on the defensive end and then went to work on the offensive glass, knocking the ball off of Irvine to earn Santa Barbara control of the ball.</p>\n<p>After junior guard Nicole Nesbit was fouled at half court, she took the inbounds pass and drove to the basket. Despite missing the layup, Underwood was there for the offensive board. Missing the first putback attempt, Underwood continued to go after the ball, grabbing her own miss and converting the second chance layup to put the Gauchos up 43-39 with 50 seconds to go.</p>\n<p>“Our team plays well when our backs are against the wall,” Underwood said. “We know we will give it our all to get that win. So I’m thinking, ‘okay I missed the first layup. I’m going to get this rebound and lay it back up.’”</p>\n<p>After a missed shot by Irvine, the Anteaters were forced to play the fouling game. Nesbit went 6-6 from the free throw line down the stretch, icing the game for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Overall, Nesbit scored a game-high 17 points while Underwood and Tilleman finished with 12 and eight points, respectively. Junior guard Destini mason grabbed a team-high 11 boards for UCSB and Aguirre tallied a team-high four assists.</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, UCSB was solid once again, holding the Anteaters to 23.1 percent shooting and outrebounding them 38-33.</p>\n<p>“I want our team to take pride in knowing if the team should only have 30 points, let’s only let them score 30,” Mitchell said. “We take a lot of pride in our defense. I don’t think that’s anything new to this group, but it will help us win a lot of games, especially as we get to March Madness.”</p>\n<p>While the game has no postseason implications, Santa Barbara knows the importance of entering playoffs with momentum.</p>\n<p>“You always want to win your last one and our last one just happened to be senior day for us,” Mitchell said. “We haven’t really worried about the record up until this point because now we understand that we’re 0-0. You’re next game is your last game, so these kids will know that every night, we’re backed into a corner and that’s how we’ll have to play is game by game.”</p>\n<p>Last year’s Big West Tournament Champions have now won three straight games and back-to-back home games for the first team this season.</p>\n<p>“There’s no magic wand that’s going to allow it to happen like it did last year,” Mitchell said. “That was a perfect script. I’d like it to be rewritten that exact same way, verbatim, but it’s not going to happen. Every other team in the conference is a lot better. You have Pacific and Hawaii that we know we can beat and you have Cal Poly, who at this point last year I think was undefeated or had one loss, so it’s kind of ironic how everything’s set back up where if we take care of ourselves, then we could put ourselves in that position again.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin postseason play Wednesday, playing the highest remaining seed from Tuesday’s first round games.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The 6’10” Scott will certainly provide a formidable post presence against the Gauchos in what could be a marquee matchup should Big Al play Thursday.</p>\n<p>Just over a week ago, Santa Barbara demolished UNLV 86-65 on the road, showing this relatively young team can handle the pressures of the road. The Gauchos’ ability to handle hostile crowds will be significantly tested in Boulder where the Buffaloes have averaged over 8,500 fans in attendance during their first four home games.</p>\n<p>In the absence of Williams, sophomore forward Sam Beeler posted 14 points and five rebounds in a career-high 28 minutes played against Utah State. Beeler will most likely be relied upon heavily once again versus Colorado with William’s availability in question.</p>\n<p>Last Saturday against Utah State, the Aggies did not have to worry about double-teaming Big Al and instead focused on shutting down UCSB’s perimeter shooters from finding open looks. No one felt it harder than senior guard Kyle Boswell who shot 2-6 from behind the arc despite shooting .500 on the season. Boswell is second on the team with 13.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Michael Bryson, meanwhile registered a season-high 15 points against the Aggies and ranks third on the team averaging 12.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>Thursday night’s game will certainly provide the Gauchos with an opportunity to make a statement to the rest of the conference if they can win against a Pac-12 program that has compiled three-straight 20-plus win seasons.</p>\n<p>Tip-off Thursday against Colorado is scheduled for 6 p.m. at the Coors Events Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 21’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/ucsb-heads-to-colorado-to-face-off-against-pac-12-foe/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/ucsb-heads-to-colorado-to-face-off-against-pac-12-foe/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/ucsb-heads-to-colorado-to-face-off-against-pac-12-foe/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/ucsb-heads-to-colorado-to-face-off-against-pac-12-foe/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/ucsb-heads-to-colorado-to-face-off-against-pac-12-foe/","id":618,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[617,616,615],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tries for Two in a Row at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.4.2013_UCSB_Womens_Basketball_vs_Peter_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.4.2013_UCSB_Womens_Basketball_vs_Peter_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos take on Hampton at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Many students are heading home for Thanksgiving right now, but for the UCSB women’s basketball team, there is business to be taken care of over the holiday break.</p>\n<p>After spending last weekend on the road, the Gauchos return home for a two-game home stand, taking on Hampton tonight.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is currently 2-2 on the year.

With a final score of 67-62, the Gauchos found a way to come from behind after trailing the entire first half.</p>\n<p>“From this game, we learned we need to bring energy from the start,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “I feel that game wouldn’t have been close if we’d started the game with a lot of energy.”</p>\n<p>As a shorter team, one highlight was the team’s ability to contain the Broncos’ pair of 6’4’’ centers.</p>\n<p>“It’s good to know that Santa Clara had two 6’4’’ players on the floor most of the night and I think we were only outrebounded by one,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Our post defense was much better. We’re finding different ways to win and all our players are contributing.”</p>\n<p>To secure the victory, the trio of Gaucho seniors put the team on their backs, combining for 50 of 67 points. This season, senior guards Nicole Nesbit, Destini Mason and Zornig have combined for 65.3 percent of the team’s scoring.</p>\n<p>Zornig especially found her stride over the weekend, posting 19 points and a career-high nine assists against St. Mary’s, and then scoring 18 against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig is] finding different ways to score,” Mitchell said. “I think early in the year, she was taking a lot of threes and at times they weren’t falling. Now, she has that attack mentality of, ‘Hey, if my three’s not falling, I own the midrange jumper,’ and then also being able to get into the lane and being able to draw fouls.”</p>\n<p>As UCSB settles into the season, one note of improvement the Gauchos will be looking for this week is consistency, as the team has, on multiple occasions this year, started out slow and had to come from behind.</p>\n<p>“We need to understand that we have the ability to close out games and put two halves together and sustain that energy,” Nesbit said. “We need to play as a team because it’s going to take all of us.”</p>\n<p>Similar to UCSB, Hampton will rely on its defense, averaging 66 points per game while holding teams to 57.8 points per game. This season, Santa Barbara has averaged 67.8 points per game while giving up 64 points per contest.</p>\n<p>Hampton also has an impressive trio of scorers. Freshman guard Malia Tate-DeFreitas averages 18 points per game, leading the Lady Pirates. Senior forward Alyssa Bennett ranks second on the team in scoring with 16.8 points per game and senior guard Nicole Hamilton averages 14.3 points and 3.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53300\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53300\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/","id":619,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[618,617,616],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faces Long Beach State at Thunderdome","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While it will surely be an emotional weekend for the UCSB women’s basketball team as it plays its final home games of the season, tonight’s game against Long Beach State is without doubt the most ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>While it will surely be an emotional weekend for the UCSB women’s basketball team as it plays its final home games of the season, tonight’s game against Long Beach State is without doubt the most crucial game of the year with seedings for the Big West Tournament on the line.</p>\n<p>“It’s an exciting game to be a part of [to] cap off our senior season and our time as Gauchos in front of our home crowd and families,” senior center Kirsten Tilleman said. “It’s incredibly important that we can do that in front of them, but also look past that and just play.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are currently holding onto fourth place in conference at 9-7 in the Big West and 13-15 overall and can solidify fourth with a victory tonight.

This weekend, the Gauchos will try to win back-to-back home games for the first time this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to realize that it is March and that there are no more opportunities to sit back and let things happen to us,” Tilleman said. “We have to be the initiators and realize that this is it.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met on Jan. 5, the score was tied at 44 with 1:41 to go. However, the Gauchos made crucial errors down the stretch and lost 52-45.</p>\n<p>“They changed defenses a lot and we had a lot of unforced turnovers,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We have to do a better job of executing no matter what defense they’re in.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers are led by a pair of sophomores in guard Alex Sanchez and center Devin Hudson. Sanchez leads her team with 10.8 points per game and ranks third in the Big West in three-point field goal percentage at 38.3 percent. Hudson averages 8.0 rebounds and leads LBSU in scoring during conference play with 10.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>“We’ll continue to play man,” Mitchell said. “That’s our bread and butter. They have shooters … so we’ll stick with what we do best.”</p>\n<p>Defense is certainly what UCSB does best. On average, the Gauchos hold their opponents to just 53.3 points per game and 36.4 percent shooting. Defensively in the last game, the Gauchos sent the 49ers to the line 33 times.
