On Saturday, the plainly commercial space of the Santa Barbara Bowl was awash in a tide of local culture, and the walkway up from the front gate to the concert stage was transformed into a vertical street festival. Altars dedicated to lost loved ones flickered under the candlelight, and stray flower petals seemed to dance aloft on the voices and hands of missing friends. Tributes to fallen idols were in abundance; I teared up a little as I passed two candy skulls painted in the likenesses of David Bowie and Prince. Our own KCSB even had a small shrine dedicated to the programmers that have passed on over the years. In a patio area halfway up the slope, as I passed a group of sequin-clad skeletons savaging a Donald Trump piñata, something occurred to me: Morrissey couldn’t have picked a better event to play.<br>\nAs I stood in the pit waiting for Moz, music videos and movie clips lit up a gigantic projector screen behind the stage. The mixture of Sex Pistols, New York Dolls, James Dean and Cher made it immediately clear that these had been selected by the man himself. When he finally did take the stage along with a band of dashing young skeleton men in shirtless tuxedos, the crowd responded like drought victims in a rainstorm. He immediately dove into “How Soon Is Now?” and the tremolo set us all rippling. It was a smart call for the opening song, as the dominant sentiment in the audience was something along the lines of, “I’d throw myself in front of a bus for Steven Patrick Morrissey, but he had better play some goddamn Smiths tunes.” Alyssa, a senior at Cal Poly, echoed these sentiments after the show saying she was, “very stoked on him, but he was a bit of a tease. I [wanted] more Smiths.”<br>\nAfter the cheering died down, he quipped, “I sure hope you all enjoy yourselves, because you’re all royally screwed come Tuesday.”  A Cheshire grin flashed across his face as the crowd erupted once more. Mozmania had officially set in, and he could now say essentially anything he wished.  Luckily he (usually) uses this power for good, and after a couple of songs the charming man paused, and the screen behind him lit up once more.  As he sung the opening lines of “Ganglord,” harrowing scenes of police brutality played out behind him. Men in riot gear dashed people’s heads against walls and shot dogs in the street, and the number of fists raised around me made it clear these scenes were all too familiar to the crowd. A round of sober applause sounded out as the last image of an officer smiling behind a riot mask faded to black.<br>\nMorrissey was quick to liven up the audience again, starting up with a cover of the Ramones’ “Judy Is a Punk” leading into “You’re the One For Me, Fatty” and “Ouija Board,” two of his solo classics.  Afterward, he performed several of his newer songs, and I admit the show might’ve lagged (musically) at this point. However, Mozzer’s signature brand of animal magnetism seemed to carry us all through the middle. The entire time, eager fans attempted to catapult themselves onstage only to be intercepted mid-flight by a group of expert bouncers. One man in a full skeleton costume was able to make it all the way and gave Morrissey a tender bear hug before a baldheaded man in a polo shirt sprang like a puma from stage right and whisked him away.<br>\nBefore the set’s finale, the Irish crooner took the time to thank his band, whom he described as “the best platoon from here to the moon.” They all bowed reverently and then polished off the crowd with “Everyday Is Like Sunday” and “First of the Gang to Die.” Morrissey’s dulcet tones were drowned out by a chorus of tearful voices, but not a soul complained. He gave the crowd a coy wave as he and the band left the stage, everyone in attendance knowing full well that the pause before the encore was mere formality. In another calculated move, Moz finished with the raucous Smiths tune “What She Said,” making a heady and frenzied end to the performance. As I walked back down past all of the altars, candles now blown out, I knew that Morrissey had done right by the spirit of the Day of the Dead. He’d awoken a light in all those watching that would never go out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74106\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74106\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/","id":6719,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6718,6717,6716],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace","biography":"Not available","articles":[5898,6538,6539,6709,6719,6747,6781,6823,6837,6842,6867,6888,6898,6918],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Jay-Z and the Direction of Product Packaging in Hip Hop","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-07-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jay-Z-graphic.2...jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jay-Z-graphic.2...jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"That’s not to say that Jay doesn’t return to his default of braggadocious bars about wealth and success, but this record is different.

Currently, the rapper/business mogul is established as one of hip hop’s most prominent and influential figures, even being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame last month. In the wake of his induction, Jay-Z announced the release date of his 13th studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which dropped on June 30. The release of this particular record is an interesting creative pivot for Jay-Z. Peering into the methodological, meticulous disposition of the record highlights the direction in which contemporary music presentation could be headed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jay-Z illustrates the application of a business mind in music industry. He secured the No. 2 spot on the latest </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> annual “Forbes Five” list of the richest figures in hip hop with an estimated net worth of $810 million. Last year, Sprint invested $200 million in his music streaming service, Tidal, which put the company’s worth at six times what he initially paid for it. Across the breadth of his career, the artist has demonstrated a fiscally successful approach to nearly everything he touches. This success, in conjunction with his musical catalog, is largely the reason why the artist is so influential.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the lens of the release of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one can observe a distinct change of style in the rapper’s product packaging. The album’s rollout wasn’t long or elaborate, contrary to many of his contemporaries’ releases (Kanye West, Drake, etc.), and its role on Tidal is quite peculiar. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tidal, Jay-Z released a collection of “short films” with the album, some of which are videos for particular tracks, while others are footnotes for those music videos which essentially contextualize their content. These films are somewhat abstract; interrupting the music in the video of “4:44” are obscure viral videos and clips that appear to be from Worldstar Hip Hop. An interpretive dance can be seen at the end of the video, perhaps depicting his and Beyonce’s relationship. In the footnotes of “The Story of OJ” and “4:44,” prominent media figures like Will Smith and Kendrick Lamar express their thoughts on race and their attitudes towards women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The presentation and packaging of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is relatively new to the rap scene. Jay-Z takes an unorthodox approach, making it an absolute pain in the ass for you to listen to his music. In order to even stream the album, you must either a) subscribe to Tidal, as his discography has been removed from all other platforms, or b) navigate a labyrinth of online tutorials that lead to free, temporary access to the streaming service. To clarify: this pain isn’t necessarily a bad thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In light of these short films and additional elements of the album (e.g., Jay-Z’s daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, laying a verse on physical copies of the album), Jay-Z provides an interactive, intimate perspective into his own life. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:44</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is far more personal than the bulk of his past work, opening up about his infidelity and thoughts on racial inequality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Kanye West, a semi-estranged affiliate of Jay-Z’s and a business enigma in himself. The release of his last record, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Life of Pablo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was one of the strangest musical occurrences of 2016. The album title erratically shifted multiple times. Analogously, the content of the album itself wasn’t static either, something completely antithetical to the nature of commercial music. That is, West released multiple updated versions of the album, framing it as a “living, evolving art project.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can additionally look to artists like Frank Ocean, who also exhibited one of the oddest album rollouts of the year. After enduring a tumultuous relationship with Def Jam Recordings and releasing the visual album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endless</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to satisfy contractual agreements with the label, Ocean released his album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a four year manifestation of the artist’s creative endeavors. Moreover, the record didn’t just come to fruition in an exclusively sonic form. Like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endless</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which paired an album with minimalistic visual production, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blonde </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was accompanied with an $80 visual compilation of mixed media: a magazine entitled “Boys Don’t Cry,” the name of his current personal music label. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artists like West and Ocean have illustrated something that Jay-Z is doing right now, something that has become increasingly popular among artists, particularly rap artists today. That is, these creators are moving beyond status quo and crafting interactive, elaborate works of art that deviate from conventional boundaries of music. Artists are becoming more creative with the way in which they promote and present their music. This isn’t something that was nonexistent prior to the work of contemporary rap artists, but rap is one of the most rapidly expanding genres of music.

But tonight a variety of students found themselves in Campbell Hall long past 8 p.m. enjoying the fusion of the sitar and tabla drums along with the rest of the Santa Barbara community.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was fortunate enough to host Zakir Hussain, one of the world’s most acclaimed tabla drummers. The tabla is a traditional Hindustani instrument that consists of a bass and high drum and requires intense training to skillfully play (with a complex series of finger and palm motions). Rising star Niladri Kumar accompanied Hussain on the sitar, which he specially modified to be an electrical “zitar.”</p>\n<p>As I walked toward Campbell Hall, it was obvious the building had been taken over and class was no longer in session. The enormous trees that often provide shade to studious students or the weekly farmers market were all lit up with blue and purple lights to signify a grand cultural show was about to commence.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Upon arrival to the venue, I found a group of audience members following the instructions and dance moves of two Bollywood dancers. Arts &amp; Lectures had provided the audience members with a preshow treat; if one was brave enough they could partake in this dance mob and learn the Indian dance moves. Despite the slightly uncoordinated dancing, it was entertaining to watch because there was a sense of unity and commitment in learning this unique dance style.</p>\n<p>Once inside the theater, it was very difficult to separate school life from pleasure. The stage was set up in a very minimalistic manner, with an elevated platform for the artists to perform on. There was nothing to act as a backdrop so the audience sat in anticipation for the act to stimulate us musically.</p>\n<p>The crowd was made up of an even range of students and a various mix of adults from the Santa Barbara community. After some eavesdropping and recognizing students from my world music class, it was easy to deduct many under the age of 25 were attending the concert for a class requirement. Those over 25 remained a mystery for the rest of the night; some seemed to be genuine fans, but the sheer range and diversity of this age group indicated this duo inspired an eclectic group.</p>\n<p>When Hussain and Kumar finally stepped on stage it was much anticipated and well-received by the audience. The internationally acclaimed drummer blessed the stage as he ascended the platform, because, as he remarked later speaking to this quarter’s World Music class, “music is sacred.”</p>\n<p>For those of us who were not so educated in the process of Indian music, Hussain kindly spent a few minutes explaining the structure of the performance. He added a flare of his personality to this speech by livening up the audience and the performance with a bit of humor.</p>\n<p>In an improvised performance that was over two hours long, excluding the 10-minute intermission, only four songs were played.</p>\n<p>The first song was purely sitar and highlighted the talents of Kumar. This left many perplexed, as they had been under the impression Zakir Hussain was the star of the show whom everyone had congregated to this venue to see. But it was further explained by the pair that the sitar takes the lead in the song and acts as the “quarterback” the tabla accompanies.</p>\n<p>The first song had a long and lustrous build that left the spectators wondering what was happening and whether Hussain was ever going to play. But the slow build was worth the wait because the song had multiple climatic points that were extraordinarily impressive. The mad sitar player commanded the instrument with such skill and moved his hands across an overwhelmingly large instrument in a way that left viewers on the edge of their seats. In the middle of his solo performance he took smooth moments to tune his instrument; after over 30 minutes of this, Kumar joked this was the “long sound check we start the concert on.”</p>\n<p>After the “sound check” the concert transitioned into what everyone was anticipating and waiting for: the inclusion of the tabla. The team finally unified and played their instruments independently and harmoniously to one another. They would look to each other for affirmation to move onto the next segment of the song or to check in to make sure one was not overpowering the other, but they were also each happily in their own element, enjoying the dramatic solos they enabled each other to play.</p>\n<p>After an intense hour full of music and a responsive audience, the two called for a short intermission that was well-deserved.</p>\n<p>The second half of the show was just as long as the preceding first half. This section of the show was faster and more vibrant, which I did not think was at all possible after witnessing the more plaintive first portion.</p>\n<p>The tabla was the focus of the second segment of the show. Hussain really honed in on his talents and impressed the audience with his inhuman drumming capabilities. The way he played so many beats at once on the cultural drums by using different parts of his hands to strike the drum was astounding, and the will he had over his hands controlling how fast the tempo played was incredible.</p>\n<p>The concert ended on a cacophony of sounds that highlighted the capabilities of both the sitar and the tabla players. The finale was so tense and dramatic that when it finally concluded the audience leapt from their seats in uproar, releasing the tension they contained while witnessing such an innovative performance.</p>\n<p>In reflection of the performance, second-year Kristine Kazangyan stated, “I thought it was super cool how they played Norwegian wood.” She brought up stylistic elements I hadn’t even noticed: “It was cool that they fused traditional and pop music in that moment.” The duo had taken their traditional sound and made it accessible to the younger audience.</p>\n<p>The good vibes kept rolling into the next day because I was fortunate enough to have the two musicians visit as guest performers in my world music class. The two gave my class a lecture on what music meant to them and how they have struggled as Indian and world musicians. They concluded their visit with a personal private performance that was greatly appreciated by the class and faculty.</p>\n<p>The sacred pair impacted the audience in Campbell hall and the students in my music class alike. The take-home message Hussain conveyed through his music and vocalized in the class was “world music is an evolving entity, not a fixed routine.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_73808\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"758785927\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73807\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73808\" data-attachment-id=\"73808\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/zakir-hussain-taps-whirlwind-beats-at-al-performance/bhangra-dance-workshop-by-ucsb-dhadkan-campbell-hall-nov-1st-2016/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?fit=6000%2C3750&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"6000,3750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bhangra Dance Workshop by UCSB Dhadkan, Campbell Hall, Nov 1st 2016.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?fit=888%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73808\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057-250x156.jpg?resize=800%2C500\" alt=\"Hari Patel / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zakir-Hussain-Niladri-Kumar_Hari-Patel_110116-013057.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73808\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hari Patel / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Garden, composed of twins Wyatt and Fletcher Shears, performed an assuredly epic orchestration of their inventive sound, self-named “vada-vada.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74173\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/50793.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"866318905\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74161\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74173\" data-attachment-id=\"74173\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/attachment/50793/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/50793.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"50793\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/50793.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/50793.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74173 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/50793.jpg?resize=640%2C400\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/50793.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/50793.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74173\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy Velvet Jones </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stepping foot into Velvet Jones, I was in complete awe, as this was the first time I had seen the venue at almost maximum capacity.  A community of artsy teenagers that could’ve easily been casted in “Stranger Things” greeted each other and harmonized over the Modern Baseball track “Wedding Singer,” playing on a loop above the empty stage. I came across concertgoer Dorothy Tang near the front of the stage and asked if she was prepared to mosh her heart out, responding by pointing at her five inch black heeled boots and saying, “These shoes weren’t made for moshing, but I’m ready to head-bang my heart away on the side!” This show was a prime example of concerts bringing complete strangers together, creating a safe space where chaos and camaraderie can coexist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three opening acts had brief sets before The Garden was scheduled to take the stage, reminiscent of a Beach Goth-esque festival setting. The second opening act Heyrocco brought forth a Nirvana atmosphere to the stage, building up to a grunge momentum and emitting songs about the never-ending wave of sadness found in a teen’s heart. Heyrocco’s union of engaging lyricism and thrilling instrumentation amplified the intensity of the purple-lit Velvet Jones. Once The Garden hit the stage, Wyatt Shears transfixed a laser-like focus on channeling a spastic diorama of sound. The bleak lyrics provided an addition to the polyrhythmic precision as Wyatt repeatedly yelled out, “I like cereal, but I’m not a serial killer.” The Garden does not rely on impressive theatrics nor grandiose stage backgrounds to get the crowd entranced, hyped up and sweating profusely on each other. During the performance of the track “All Smiles Over Here,” the crowd turned into a maelstrom of failed stage dives, checkered Vans flying in the air and Wyatt handing the mic to ecstatic fans so they could shout out the chorus. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Midway during the set, the sonic distortion escaping from Wyatt’s buoyant vocals in “Crystal Clear” created a journey of sensory annihilation. The bass riffs combined with Fletcher’s thunderous drumming when performing the single “Egg,” displayed The Garden’s stylistically diverse dynamic. The audience reciprocated the same chaotic energy that The Garden put into their performance, creating a symbiotic relationship between fans and the band. The eager fans erupted in a rage for an encore, pleading for one final song to draw the night to a close. Fletcher and Wyatt responded to their dire calls and performed “I’m A Woman,” an ode to the twins’ ability to defy gender roles. A realization hit the audience that perhaps The Garden’s songs were meant to be sung together, in a space where everyone feels at ease and accepted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crowd dispersed toward the entrance of Velvet Jones, people lit their cigarettes with sweat shining from their foreheads and exchanged words about Wyatt’s spontaneous dance moves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sum up the show, second-year Chloe Anderson said, “The night was fun and interesting, but most of it consisted of me desperately trying to avoid getting caught and trampled in a giant mosh pit.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Garden provided a show composed of unbridled energy, innate eccentricity and polite fans offering a helping hand to anyone who dropped on the floor during the escalated moshing intervals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Shears twins don’t adhere to any guidelines, rules  or preconceptions — they embody their own conceptual style of music. Their music is centered on having free reign on creative landscapes and being able to illustrate a panel of alluring emotions through the medium of unconventional sounds. In The Garden’s world, there is no focus on wanting to fit in with what is deemed to be cool in the punk scene. They dare to defy gender roles, genre molds and the tangents of normality.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74161\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74161\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-12/the-garden-rocks-velvet-jones/","id":6718,"author":{"id":671,"name":"Jasmine Rodriguez"},"related":[6717,6716,6715],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
