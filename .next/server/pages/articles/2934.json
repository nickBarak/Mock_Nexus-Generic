Finance and Business Committee met Monday night to hear funding requests from 26 campus organizations.<br><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee met to hear from 26 different organizations funding requests on Monday night.</p>\n<p>Sixteen organizations received the full funding for their requests, while seven received partial funding and three received none. Groups that were partially funded included Sigma Chi Omega, Raices De Mi Tierra, Dance Marathon, the Hong Kong Student Association, Alpha Kappa Psi, Theta Nu Kappa and the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega requested funding for $5,800 and received $2,669 for their 17th annual Multicultural Show Feb 21 in Campbell Hall. According to committee member Nadia Blant, Campbell Hall is an expensive venue to fund, therefore the committee deferred on funding the entire event.</p>\n<p>“I think the venue is super expensive and because they are multicultural, there is a lot of places they could go,” Blant said, “I think we need to cut if we are going to make all these events work, so I would fund the venue but not the performing actors.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Raices De Mi Tierra received $12,000 from their requested $15,200, while Dance Marathon requested $4,350 and received $4,150 when the committee decided not to give them $200 in material costs for the event on Feb 28 at Pavilion Gym. Dance Marathon Chair Sean Thompson, who asked for funding from the committee, said Dance Marathon is “the largest collegiate charity in the nation and is present in over 250 campuses nationwide.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Storke Plaza will become a place for international students, Asian-American students and faculty to experience Lunar New Year festival celebration while at the same time bringing cultural awareness to such a unique and joyous location at UCSB. – Hong Kong Student’s Association Officer Simon Tam</p></blockquote>\n<p>“We work through Children’s Miracle Network, which is a network of hospitals that are children’s hospitals and our local chapter is Santa Barbara’s Cottage Children’s Hospital, so all of the proceeds through our Dance Marathon event go to them,” Thompson said, “My favorite part is that we bring the kids from the hospital too, so you get to meet them, dance with them and play with them.”</p>\n<p>The Hong Kong Student Association asked for $3,970 and received $1,120 for the annual Lunar New Year festival on Feb. 12 at Storke Plaza and are expecting about 200 people. According to Hong Kong Student’s Association Officer Simon Tam, the event’s purpose is to “emulate the festival atmosphere of a traditional Asian Lunar New Year festival by bringing UCSB our cultural foods, performances, music, games and activities.”</p>\n<p>“Storke Plaza will become a place for international students, Asian-American students and faculty to experience Lunar New Year festival celebration while at the same time bringing cultural awareness to such a unique and joyous location at UCSB,” Tam said.</p>\n<p>Alpha Kappa Psi received $242 from their requested $282, the $40 difference due to the committee’s inability to fund water bottles for a Coffee and Donuts event on Feb 26 in the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge.</p>\n<p>“We are hosting a professional development night open to all students. We will be hosting workshops that help fill resumes, give interview tips, stuff like that,” said a speaker for Alpha Kappa Psi.</p>\n<p>Theta Nu Kappa’s speaker third-year feminist studies and political science major Derek Wakefield received $410 for a Quidditch tournament after the committee could not fund them $75 for water bottles.</p>\n<p>“We are bringing in a sport that has never been seen, except for with the Quidditch team, but they have not had as many really wide open tournaments open at the university,” Wakefield said. “We want to make this an event that can really persist throughout the years and be something that you know people think, ‘Oh I am going to go to the Quidditch tournament like it becomes a Santa Barbara staple.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60141\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60141\" data-attachment-id=\"60141\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-27/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-hears-requests/finance-board/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1422350836\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"Finance Board\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Finance Board\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-60141\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Finance-Board_Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=440%2C293\" alt=\"A.S.

Alexander from “America’s Next Top Model” who will be giving a question and answer, meet and greet and a workshop.</p>\n<p>“Miss J. is awesome,” Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus said, “I got so many texts from friends, people outside of the queer community that were just fans in general of someone who has been on television or in the fashion industry for years.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hacks was reallocated $13,654 for an event this weekend, the women’s lacrosse team received $3,000 to take 30 players to Nationals on May 4 to account for hotel and flight fees and the Wildlife Society received the requested $130 for a speaker from Washington to come give a talk on myths surrounding wolves on Feb. 23 at the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration at Harder Stadium, said a speaker for the Wildlife Society.</p>\n<p>“It is where the biology department keeps all of its taxonomic collections. We have thousands and thousands of specimens, mammals, birds, so if you haven’t been there it pretty cool you should check it out,” a speaker for the Wildlife Society said.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Surfriders received the requested $2,500 for Concert for the Coast on May 30 at Anisq’Oyo’ Park where proceeds will go towards the Environmental Defense Center.</p>\n<p>“We have ocean-friendly gardens and we want people to participate in that and are trying to change their grass lawns into really efficient ways to collect ocean runoff and to prevent pollution from the streets from going into the ocean,” a speaker for Surfriders said, “We also have a ‘Rise above Plastics’ campaign and we want to gain awareness about that.”</p>\n<p>Reel Loud was not given funding for their $12,000 request for the 23rd Annual Film Festival that will take place May 22, as it was unclear where the money they would make off of the event would go. Committee member Ava Rezai said the committee will table the event.</p>\n<p>Hermanos Unidos and Sigma Alpha Zeta received funding for $19,812 towards outreach to high school students and UCSB’s League of Legends is hosting an e-sports charity tournament and received $500 for food for the event on Feb. 8 from in the Loma Pelona Center.</p>\n<p>Religion Experience in Mind received $620, the Multicultural Greek Council received $443 for Love in the Hub on Feb. 14, Zeta Phi Beta received $300 for a conference about leadership regarding violence towards African-Americans, $300 went toward the event Out of the Orgs, Santa Barbara’s Hillel received $70 for the New Year of the Trees on Tu B’shvat, Rho Psi Eta received $1250 for CPR training on Feb. 21, the Kendo Club received $1,175 for a UCLA tournament on March 1, On Campus Senators received $100 for a forum next Monday in the San Rafael formal lounge and the National Society of Black Engineers received $3,500 for a convention in Anaheim California from March 25-29.</p>\n<p>The Cotillion Dance Club was tabled, as no speaker arrived, and UCSB’s Hillel’s Kosher event for $120 was not funded.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The summit will also include various food-related workshops and activities as well as lectures by speakers such as food justice advocate Nikki Silvestri and renowned chef Crystal DeLongpré, also known as Food Network’s Chef Pink. The event will also feature a screening of “Occupy the Farm,” a documentary following food justice advocates.</p>\n<p>According to Isla Vista Food Co-Op General Manager Melissa Cohen, the summit will allow attendees to become exposed to new ideas, solutions and innovations regarding food distribution and consumption that can prompt others to make positive impacts on the current food system.</p>\n<p>“People are bringing their expertise from projects they’re working on in their own communities and campuses outward so that kind of information can be shared and modeled,” Cohen said. “Because the best thing that can happen in a situation like this is people present projects that can be replicated.”</p>\n<p>According to Tim Galarneau, a member of the advisory board at Real Food Challenge, which is a campaign to shift the way universities source food, the summit is designed to be all-inclusive and allow all attendees to both learn and participate.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited to see a cross section of students, staff/faculty, and community partners coming together on MLK weekend to engage in conversations and planning toward bridging access, equity, and justice in our food system,” Galarneau said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Food Bank Chair and event organizer Katie Freeze said she is looking forward to listening to seasoned chefs and food advocates impart their wisdom upon event attendees.<br>\n“Summit participants will have the opportunity to enjoy meals prepared by local chefs, participate in educational workshops and listen to inspirational keynote speakers,” Freeze said.</p>\n<p>The summit will also include a series of talks and workshops designed to help attendees learn more about the food they eat, where it comes from and how to protect and conserve food resources. Workshops such as “Santa Barbara County Food Action Plan and Food Justice: Health, Access, Environment, Labor,” will take place in classrooms on the first floor of the UCen.</p>\n<p>Freeze said she hopes the summit will bring student attention to issues regarding the nation’s currently “broken” food system.</p>\n<p>“The summit’s primary mission is to start a dialogue surrounding food justice and food security in the UC community,” Freeze said, “and to help students realize the role they play in helping to fix our broken food system on a local and statewide level.”</p>\n<p>Keynote speaker Silvestri, who in addition to co-founding food justice advocacy campaign Live Real and directing national clean energy economy organization Green For All also developed a course curriculum for the UC system, has advocated statewide for environmental justice and political ecology programs for the last ten years. Cohen said she is particularly looking forward to the opportunity to hear Silvestri speak and hopes students will take advantage of the opportunity as well.</p>\n<p>“Nikki Silvestri is a huge person who influences me, helping me feel comfortable to have the right lexicon — the right words and the right knowledge — for how to talk about … these issues,” Cohen said.</p><div

Wellness Services Mary Jacob will begin serving as acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs on Feb. 2 following former Vice Chancellor Michael Young’s retirement, in which Young will be leaving behind his 25-year career as Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>Jacob’s career with the Division of Student Affairs began in 1996, where she has began as Director of the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) and then later became the Senior Associate Dean and Executive Director of Student Academic Support Services. During her recently previously held position as Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services, she oversaw admissions, registrar, financial aid and early academic outreach.</p>\n<p>During Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s campus announcement on Jacob’s appointment last week, Yang said Jacob is well versed in the nuances and challenges of working within education and has received numerous campus recognitions during her career.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate Dr. Jacob’s longstanding dedication to our campus and especially our students,” Yang said. “Dr. Jacob has been deeply engaged in education-related activities at the national and international levels as well. She has been recognized with a UCSB Staff Citation for Excellence Award, and a Margaret T. Getman Service to Students Award.”</p>\n<p>OISS Director Simran Singh said he has worked with Jacob since 2002 and that her past work with the university has demonstrated that she is an excellent administrator.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen her in action,” Singh said. “She’s … able to keep many different sets of needs in mind as she makes decisions.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think she is an ideal choice for the interim position. – Former Vice Chancellor Michael Young</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jacob said her time with OISS introduced her to a broad range of operations on campus that have prepared her to assume the duties involved with leading the Student Affairs Division.</p>\n<p>“During that time I got to understand how the Graduate Division operates and how Student Affairs operates, so that gave me a very broad training,” said Jacob.</p>\n<p>Jacob also said her time with the Student Academic Support Services and Enrollment Services gave her the necessary skillset and experience she will need to take on the position.</p>\n<p>“I got greater in-depth experience within the division and on budget processes … through my work as the Executive Director and Associate Dean for Student Academic Support Services and in my current role as the Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>Young, who first met Jacob when she was a candidate for the position of Director of the OISS 19 years ago, said her career thus far at the university makes her an ideal fit for the position.</p>\n<p>“She’s had departmental experience as the department head, she’s had responsibility as a patrol point, she’s a senior administrator in the leadership of the Division and has been so for a number of years,” Young said. “I think she is an ideal choice for the interim position.”</p>\n<p>While her work with Young has helped prepare her to receive the chancellor’s offer to serve as Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Jacob said she was still surprised when she got the call to take on Young’s position.</p>\n<p>“[Young] has an executive group that works with him, and I’ve been a part of that group for a number of years, so I knew that he felt I was prepared if I was asked to be in this position on an interim basis,” Jacob said. “I was prepared if I were asked, but on another level I was surprised when I got a call from the chancellor.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to maintain the vision that Michael has had — that we have an inclusive community that is supportive and challenging for our students in productive ways – and to provide the best possible services and programs to our students. – Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mary Jacob</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jacob also said Young has been an extraordinary leader and will be a hard act to follow.</p>\n<p>“He’s leaving enormous shoes behind to fill, and I’m going to do my best to fill them as much as I can in the time that I’m in the position,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>According to Jacob, she will continue to promote the “inclusive” campus climate and support services available to students during Young’s career.</p>\n<p>“I want to maintain the vision that Michael has had — that we have an inclusive community that is supportive and challenging for our students in productive ways – and to provide the best possible services and programs to our students,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>Young said he trusts Jacob to take on his role, but will be available with his expertise if she needs it.</p>\n<p>“I’ve told her that I won’t be around to interfere or meddle in her affairs, but I’m a phone call way or an email away for a point of view or more likely information — some detail that would be helpful to her,” Young said.</p>\n<p>According to Young, the campus community has a good future ahead of it with Jacob as its Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>“I’m prepared to be helpful in any way that she needs, but I can tell you that the campus — particularly the staff in Division of Students Affairs and the students that we serve through our programs and our initiatives — are well served with Mary Jacob as the Acting Vice Chancellor.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The products are located in all of the Chi-5 residence halls, including San Nicholas Hall (above). <em>Courtesy of Wiki Commons</em></p></div>\n<p>The program is currently limited to the Channel Island 5 residence halls – Anacapa Hall, Santa Cruz Hall, Santa Rosa Hall, San Miguel Hall and San Nicholas Hall – but hopes to expand to Manzanita Village and the Santa Catalina Towers during Winter Quarter 2019.</p>\n<p>Santa Cruz Hall Representative-At-Large Michelle Chang first proposed the idea during the 2017-2018 school year. The initiative was continued this year by Programming Vice President Austin Rowe of the Residential Housing Association (RHA).</p>\n<p>Rowe says the point of the Period Pantry is simple: to “provide a large amount of free menstrual hygiene products in all female-identified and gender-neutral restrooms in the residence halls for anyone who needs them to use.”</p>\n<p>The program provides plastic boxes, located in each of the Channel Island 5 residence halls, stocked with a variety of period products for residents.</p>\n<p>According to Rowe, the Pantry began last year in San Nicolas and San Miguel, but it wasn’t until Fall Quarter 2018 that the program began in full with the addition of Period Peers. The peers are student volunteers who are responsible for restocking the restrooms daily.</p>\n<p>Each volunteer is assigned to a particular restroom in their respective residential halls. They have a bag of excess pads and tampons distributed by RHA at the ready so they can restock the boxes as regularly as possible.</p>\n<p>The Period Peer program is completely volunteer-based. Kaitlyn Medland, San Miguel RHA President and member of the Internal Committee for the Period Pantry, was in charge of gathering volunteers for the program in San Miguel Hall.</p>\n<p>The selection process was very much on a first come, first served basis, Medland said.</p>\n<p>Medland and Rowe both described the implementation of the Period Pantry as an administrative and student-led process.</p>\n<p>After Chang’s initial proposal, all the presidents, representatives-at-large and other special positions from each residential hall gathered to discuss the motion and vote for whether it would receive RHA funding or not.</p>\n<p>The members ultimately voted yes, Medland said.</p>\n<p>“The way I see it, the Period Pantry is making the most of our residents’ funds, giving them easy access to a wide range of supplies,” Rowe said.</p>\n<p>And thus far, it seems that students are on board with the program, Medland said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve actually heard a lot of people say that it’s really neat that we’re offering these supplies,” she said. “We have the free condom boxes and yet we [didn’t] have free menstrual supplies even though … you can’t stop your period.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-29/rha-introduces-free-menstrual-products-in-the-chi-5-residence-halls/","id":2933,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[2932,2931,2930],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
