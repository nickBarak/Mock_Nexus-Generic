Santa Barbara committed 15 second-half turnovers on the way to a 75-69 loss at the hands of Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>With the loss, the Gauchos fall to 7-11 overall with a 3-4 mark in the Big West. Northridge, meanwhile, snapped a seven-game losing streak and registered its first conference victory this season, bringing its record to 10-10 overall (1-7 Big West).</p>\n<p>“I just felt like we imploded,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve been pretty good in close games and our kids have made plays and stayed calm, and in this game we didn’t do those things. We imploded out there.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Up 59-52, UCSB looked to be in control of the game and on its way to victory despite missing sophomore center Alan Williams. Northridge switched to a full court press, however, leading to 13 straight points and a 65-59 lead that Santa Barbara was unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>A pair of sophomore forwards in Stephan Hicks and Stephen Maxwell fueled Northridge to victory. Maxwell led the Matadors with an impressive 27-point, 12-rebound night, while Hicks scored 24 points and recorded four steals. Northridge out-rebounded UCSB 43-31 and committed only 11 turnovers compared to the Gauchos’ 15.</p>\n<p>“I thought [Northridge’s players] were warriors out there, coming back when they went down seven,” Coach Williams said. “When you’re 0-7 and you go down seven in that second half, you could implode a little bit. And they didn’t, they kept fighting and they kept in there.”</p>\n<p>Without its leading scorer and rebounder in Big Al, UCSB relied on the play of freshman forwards Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe to replace the production down low. While Brewe scored two points and grabbed four boards, Beeler had a breakout game with 13 points, six rebounds and three blocks.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re getting what we can get out of them,” Coach Williams said. “They’re playing hard, they’re raw, they’re going to have positives, they’re going to have negatives; that’s part of growing up. Sam obviously put up some good numbers and shows he has good promise.”</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Taran Brown led UCSB with 18 points on 4-9 shooting from behind the arc, becoming the school leader in single season three-pointers made by a freshman in the process. Junior guard Kyle Boswell had 15 points for the Gauchos and junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle registered a season-high nine points after missing most of the season due to injury.</p>\n<p>“They out-rebounded us a little bit there. It was just a very physical game overall, I would say,” Beeler said. “When we had turnovers, we kind of got out of our groove I think, and that was hard to come back from and obviously that was very frustrating.”</p>\n<p>Now the Gauchos must look to Saturday’s game when they will host new Big West member Hawaii. The Warriors fell 88-59 at Cal Poly last night and enter with a 10-9 record (4-4 Big West).</p>\n<p>“We just know that they’re a big team,” Hornbuckle said. “Our big men are going to have to come out and play hard and keep playing hard like they’re doing.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii started its tenure in the Big West on fire with three straight conference victories but have since dropped three of four. The Warriors have lost their last two games by a combined 40 points and are 0-3 in road conference games this season.</p>\n<p>“We watch film. We’re as familiar with their players by now by watching film as we are with anybody in the league,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game against Hawaii is scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. at the Thunderdome. The game will be televised on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January 25th, 2013’s print edition of the

Hopefully this is an opportunity for us to bond, unite and build the chemistry and trust you need. This is a great facility at UCSB, a great city and I think all of our guys are pretty happy to be here.”</p>\n<p>According to Director of Public Relations Chris Clark , the location for the Kings training camp was between Santa Barbara and one other location. However, when Kings Staff checked the site in August, they decided UCSB was the perfect place.</p>\n<p>“You’re always looking for somewhere that can relax your guys,” Clark said. “It’s a long season, 82 games. Santa Barbara gives us the chance to come to a beautiful locale, good weather and good facilities. When you combine all those things, it was an easy decision.”</p>\n<p>Sacramento will be conducting training camp at UCSB until Sunday, Oct. 6 at which point they will travel to face Golden State in their first preseason game of the season Oct. 7.</p>\n<p>Golden State may be a familiar opponent to many members of the Kings, as Malone was an assistant with the Warriors during last season’s impressive campaign.</p>\n<p>Other members of the Kings’ front office that hold ties to the Warriors community include advisor Chris Mullin (Warriors’ Hall of Famer and former GM), owner Vivek Ranadive (former part-owner of Warriors) and General Manager Pete D’Alessandro (former Warriors’ assistant GM).</p>\n<p>“Obviously I was a part of [the Warriors] the last two years,” Malone said. “We wish them well, but we’re doing our own thing. This is about the Sacramento Kings. It’s just a new day for Sacramento and the fact that a lot of people came up from the bay is just a coincidence.”</p>\n<p>After undergoing much turmoil in the form of ownership issues and a possible relocation to Seattle in previous seasons, the Kings can finally get away from all the off-court drama associated with the franchise and focus back on the court.</p>\n<p>“Not having you guys have to ask me if we’re going to be staying this year is definitely good and it’s great for the fans too,” forward Jason Thompson said. “On the court, the mindset has changed too. We’re going to be a defensive team that can get out and score. We’ll be a fun team to watch.”</p>\n<p>With a new era under Malone comes a new style of play, which looks to dramatically improve on the defensive end for a team that ranked last in points allowed per game last season by a large margin.</p>\n<p>“I want to defend and from the defense, everything else will come,” Malone said. “We still want to run, but we want to run with discipline. None of that will happen if we don’t commit to defending and rebounding at a high level.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, the new regime wants a more unselfish style of play, as evidenced by the team’s move to send Tyreke Evans to New Orleans in exchange for point guard Greivis Vasquez, who ranked third in the NBA last season with 9.0 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Combined with fellow point guard Isaiah Thomas, the Kings look set at a position that was so often reliant on the shoot-first Evans.</p>\n<p>“What I loved today was that [we had] two highly competitive players fighting for a starting job pushing each other,” Malone said. “We have two very talented point guards that will hopefully lead us to a lot of wins this year.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the Kings is center DeMarcus Cousins, who was recently signed to a four-year $62 million deal that clearly shows the team’s trust in Cousins to become the franchise player that will once again lead them to the postseason.</p>\n<p>Other notable players in attendance include John Salmons, Thomas, Marcus Thornton, Ben McLemore and Jason Thompson.</p>\n<p>Now that a new season has arrived for a franchise with a much changed makeup, the Kings will try and improve upon last season’s 28-54 record and possibly contend for a playoff spot in the ultra-competitive Western Conference.</p>\n<p>“Obviously the goal is to make the playoffs,” Guard Jimmer Fredette said. “We want to move forward as an organization and as a team and get better each and every day.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly seems like the perfect place for a franchise searching for a fresh start and if the vibe from the Kings training camp is any indication, a little bit of Santa Barbara may be just what the Kings needed to start off the season on a high note.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 3 of October 2, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kristen Henneman of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52279\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52279\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/","id":653,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[652,651,650],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Battle For Position, Host Titans","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With a postseason conference birth already clinched, the eighth-place UCSB men’s basketball team has a chance to improve its standing tonight when it hosts seventh-place Cal State Fullerton.

With senior night looming, UCSB has a chance to end the regular season with a winning streak before March Madness commences.</p>\n<p>“It’s important for us to build momentum going into the Big West Tournament,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “That’s what this weekend really provides, is an opportunity to hopefully get Nate back on the floor for senior night, to hopefully win two games and build momentum and have a three-game winning streak.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos must first face a dangerous Fullerton squad that has certainly given UCSB fits in the past. The Titans previously defeated UCSB 86-79 on their home floor to open conference play on Dec. 29 and were led by senior forward Sammy Yeager’s 30 points on 8-11 shooting from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“They have some big time scorers on their team,” Boswell said. “We know that their strength is to score the basketball, so … we’ve got to contest shots on the defensive end and we’ll have a good shot at winning.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton currently ranks first in the conference and eighth in the nation, averaging 78.4 points per game. Fullerton is capable of lighting up the scoreboard any night and features the second, third and eighth leading scorers in the conference in senior guards D.J. Seeley and Kwame Vaughn to compliment Yeager.</p>\n<p>“They’re one of the top teams in the nation in terms of scoring the basketball,” Boswell said. “If we can limit their shot attempts and good shots that they get, we’ll be in good shape.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has struggled with injuries for much of the season but is finally looking healthier with Boswell, sophomore center Alan Williams and junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle all returning from injury in the last few weeks. Guard Nate Garth, the team’s lone senior, returned to practice Tuesday and may return to the lineup in time for senior night Saturday.</p>\n<p>Big Al will be the focus for the Gauchos’ offense tonight as Fullerton possesses a lineup full of capable scoring guards but lacks depth in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to hurt them on the glass, hurt them inside, we need to make them pay for being undersized,” Coach Williams said. “We need to play to our advantage, which should be our strength and our size and how physical we should be inside.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1384689356\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50535\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50541\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-07/gauchos-battle-for-position-host-titans/magaligauthier_mbasketball_11112-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=300%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"300,520\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1351806281\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"6400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.001\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=144%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=300%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50541\" alt=\"MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112 (1)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11-144x250.jpg?resize=144%2C250\" width=\"144\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?resize=144%2C250&amp;ssl=1 144w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\">MAGALI GAUTHIER / DAILY NEXUS</span></h6>\n<h6>Senior guard Nate Garth missed eight games with a hamstring injury but returned to practice this week.

The sophomore guard made 5-of-7 attempts from beyond the arc, racking up 15 points.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opened the game up aggressively, leading 27-21 at the end of the first quarter; however, the Lumberjacks found a way to turn things around before halftime. NAU’s ability to out-rebound the Gauchos 43-38, al while forcing 11 total turnovers were instrumental parts of its effort to stay in the game.</p>\n<p>Additionally, big performances from Lumberjacks Olivia Lucero and Kenna McDavis powered Northern Arizona’s big offensive night. The duo of redshirt seniors combined for 47 points, with Lucero pouring on a game-high 26 to go along with a game-high 11 assists.</p>\n<p>McDavis, a forward, went to work on the glass, grabbing a game-high 13 boards. UCSB scored 18 points in the quarter. With the momentum shifting, the Lumberjacks led 47-45.</p>\n<p>After the break, Santa Barbara regained its composure, stepping it up offensively by utilizing its skilled forward in the paint. The Gauchos fed Edelman in the third quarter, allowing the redshirt senior to score nine in the period as part of a 30-point quarter to regain the lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s bench outscored the Lumberjack second rotation 26-14, fueling a comeback of sorts after the lackluster second quarter. With Norther Arizona also having a strong offensive quarter, the 30-point quarter for Santa Barbara only gave the Gauchos a 75-72 lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos demonstrated great composure down the stretch Friday, never trailing in the final quarter to the persistent Lumberjacks. Using a clutch three-pointer from Hernandez and free-throws from Bates, the Gauchos held on to win 96-93.</p>\n<p>Despite the win, Santa Barbara got beat in the paint Friday, being outrebounded as mentioned and outscored in the paint 44-36. Notably, UCSB only forced five turnovers and failed to convert any of those turnovers into buckets while the Lumberjacks scored 14 points off turnovers.</p>\n<p>While there’s obviously a learning curve one game into the season, it seems the Gauchos have all the pieces for success this year. Some tweaks on defense will need to be made, but the team’s mix of returnees and newcomers such as Bates makes UCSB a tough team to gameplan against.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79658\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79658\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-13/gauchos-use-high-scoring-effort-to-open-season-with-a-win/","id":655,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[654,653,652],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
