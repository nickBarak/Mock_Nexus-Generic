People think that you can drop the gloves at any time, beat the shit out of someone and not suffer any sort of recourse. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Yes, you can fight in hockey.

The desire to scrap is usually signified visually by a shaking of the gloves and verbally by an overt challenge, such as, “Want to go?” Once a player drops the gloves, he is considered the instigator.</p>\n<p>The player who steps in to defend his teammate risks initiating a fight with a dance partner who isn’t willing. It’s frowned upon to throw a cheap shot and refuse to fight afterward.</p>\n<p>To go after someone and start pounding on them can get the aggressor kicked out of the game and result in a penalty for instigating. Despite this punishment, players who stick up for their teammates are highly respected, even if the player who threw the cheap hit doesn’t consent. If that player does consent to defend himself and can hold his own, he gains a bit of respect, although it’s generally not enough to offset the cheap hit.</p>\n<p>Most talented players don’t fight on a regular basis. Usually, when a skilled player is about to get involved in an altercation, one of the scrappier players on the roster will step in and put himself at risk. It may seem like a puss move by the more talented player, but the hierarchy demands this type of sacrifice from certain players on the roster.</p>\n<p>There are exceptions in the hierarchy. Some skilled players are willing to take matters into their own hands. But for elite athletes who make millions of dollars expected to contribute in other areas, fighting is an unnecessary medical risk. A broken hand can sideline a player for a month, while a concussion from getting knocked out can derail an entire career.</p>\n<p>In fact, many players are just on the roster for scrapping ability and continuously have to fight to maintain their status as valuable members of the team. Most teams have a heavyweight for this purpose. Heavyweights are categorized as such because of their size and fighting ability.</p>\n<p>Consider Deryk Engelland, standing 6’2” and weighing 202 pounds. He’s a small side heavyweight. Consider Derek Boogaard, standing at 6’7” and about 275 pounds. He’s the biggest.</p>\n<p>Mike Tyson in his prime clocked in at around 6’0”, 220 pounds. Having a monster like Boogaard on your team, even on the bench, discourages opposing players from taking liberties with your team for fear of retribution. It’s not necessary that they play to be effective.</p>\n<p>In cases of retribution or personal vendettas, things can get downright nasty, with guys continuing to go at each other after the zebras try to step in, fighting strictly to injure. In a scrap between enforcers, when the refs come in to break things up, accomplished fighters will give each other a nod or a tap to signify a “good fight.” There is always a certain level of respect that must be maintained.</p>\n<p>Fighting is a worst-case scenario, but it has a time and place in the sport. To create or swing momentum, rather than taking themselves off the ice for five minutes to serve a fighting penalty, players would do better to throw a crushing hit. But those opportunities occur infrequently, and chasing after that big hit can create scoring chances for the other team, so sometimes fighting is the only way to right the ship and get back on track. To get back at a team for a hit, it would be more effective to score a few goals and get retribution with a win, but guys don’t think logically when their teammates get hit hard, particularly when an injury occurs.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the gloves just have to drop.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>Hockey columnist Josh Deitell wishes he were 6’7”, 275.

Following his retirement, I decided that Larry Fitzgerald would be ok, that even without Warner he would still have an elite level season. I thought that even if Matt Leinart didn’t get the job, someone would be able to get the ball to Fitzgerald. So I drafted him. And you know what? I was wrong.</p>\n<p>This season, with the revolving door that has been the Arizona Cardinals’ quarterback position, Fitzgerald has managed just one double-digit fantasy day and has yet to break 100 receiving yards in a game. At this time last year, he had 509 receiving yards and five touchdowns. He currently has 331 receiving yards and just two touchdowns. And as much as it hurts the Cardinals, I think it hurts me more.</p>\n<p>But it is not all Warner’s fault. Oh no, he had an accomplice by the name of Ben Roethlisberger — the quarterback of the Pittsburg Steelers — who was suspended for the first four games of the regular season.</p>\n<p>I knew about his suspension when I drafted Steelers’ receiver Hines Ward. My thinking was similar to what it had been with Fitzgerald that someone would get the ball to Ward. And the upside was that I knew Roethlisberger would eventually return. Once again I was wrong to trust “other” quarterbacks. In the four games the Steelers played without Roethlisberger, Ward had more than three receptions only once, accumulated more than 34 receiving yards only once, and scored just one touchdown.</p>\n<p>In the two games since Roethlisberger’s return, Ward has doubled his total reception yards for the season, scored two touchdowns, and has gotten me a total of 30 fantasy points — 10 more than he got in the previous four games combined. The upside of course is that the season isn’t quite half over yet — I still have a chance to make up for the damage those two have done — but even I’m not happy that Roethlisberger is back. Now it just feels like he’s mocking me.</p>\n<p>Check in next week for my midseason fantasy report to see who had a great first half and who would rather be drinking their sorrows away in Isla Vista on Halloween.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: Ryan Fitzpatrick, QB, Buffalo Bills. He plays for the Bills, I know, but over his last four games he has racked up 20.5 fantasy points, which is more than guys like Peyton Manning and Drew Brees. I’m not sure he’ll keep it up for the rest of the season, but there isn’t any indication that he won’t, and with Tony Romo out for the season, I’m sure a good deal of you people are in need of a quarterback, and Big Fitzy can still be found on free agent lists in 95 percent of ESPN leagues.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Josh Greenberg’s Halloween is completely ruined by his sub-.500

held a discussion led by professors of film and media studies Lisa Parks and Jennifer Holt on former system administrator for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Edward Snowden and the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance disclosures in 2013.</p>\n<p>The documentary was shown to a sold-out theater and followed the first interactions between NSA analyst-at-the-time Snowden, filmmaker Laura Poitras, who directed the film and then-journalist for the <em>Guardian, </em>Glenn Greenwald. Poitras had been working on a film that tackled the issue of surveillance when Snowden had first contacted her, using the codename Citizenfour. The film examined the United States government’s role in spying on its own citizens and the dangers of such surveillance. After the screening, Parks and Holt began a group discussion about the film and the audience’s opinions on the issue.</p>\n<p>According to Parks, Poitras learned encryption after making the post-9/11 films “My Country, My Country” and “The Oath,” receiving scrutiny and interrogation from the federal government and having equipment confiscated after their releases. Parks said Snowden contacted Poitras because of her familiarity with encrypted communication that would allow them to communicate without surveillance.</p>\n<p>“The whole [film] is a documentary born in encrypted form. It might be one of the first films born in [this form],” Parks said. “We wouldn’t really even see any of this if it weren’t for encryption. The only reason Snowden opens to Poitras is because he knew she knew encryption techniques.”</p>\n<p>Parks said she and Holt were “struck” by the revelations made clear by the film that she believes had previously been unseen and unheard.</p>\n<p>“The hotel room sequence of the film was the material that had not been released before ‘Citizenfour’ hit theaters,” Parks said. “It was this important audio-visual record that shows these conversations that took place between the journalists and the whistleblower.”</p>\n<p>Holt, who teaches media criticism course Film 70, said Americans have become more aware of the inner workings of government surveillance due to Snowden’s 2013 surveillance disclosures.</p>\n<p>“You’re supposed to know more about them [the government] than they are supposed to know about you,” Holt said. “But it’s exactly the inverse these days.”</p>\n<p>Parks said the film highlighted various issues beside privacy concerns including the right to freedom of expression and confidential intergovernmental relationships.</p>\n<p>“We could also extend the discussion … [to] the freedom of speech,” Parks said. “Once you invade people’s privacy, the act of freedom of expression changes. There’s also the issue of the NSA’s actions changing [the] United States’ relationship to other countries around the world, and has fundamentally changed its foreign policy.”</p>\n<p>During the discussion, students raised concerns about the government’s ability to spy on U.S. citizens and Holt said the surveillance apparatus used by the U.S government was expanded with the establishment of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) in 1978, which oversees requests by the NSA.</p>\n<p>“The FISA  court’s powers, which only hears one side which is the government’s side, which never releases any of its proceedings, and never denies any requests for surveillance, [have been] enhanced by an amendment to the original 1978 establishment to approve blanket surveillance,” Holt said. “There’s many dimensions of surveillance infrastructure that we have to think about moving forward.”</p>\n<p>One community member who had lived through the Vietnam era called on youth in the audience to question their government with online and public protests.</p>\n<p>According to Parks, students and Americans must keep open minds as national politics and the world continue to change. Parks said she recognizes the value of looking to history for insight on how to enact change in the modern age. Parks also said individuals need to be open to political and governmental change as well as remember that the American public can be a force to drive that change.</p>\n<p>“I do think a lot of my students may not be out in the streets, but they are definitely formulating political sensibilities and trying to navigate through vast amounts of information — all kinds of different information, gushes of information from the Internet and social media, to figure out how to take a political stand in the world today,” Parks said.</p>\n<p>According to Holt, confronting important issues such as the right to privacy and freedom of speech starts with education.</p>\n<p>“Commit yourself to reading and learning everything you can so you can be an engaged citizen and take action. It can only go from there,” Holt said. “But it can only start from a place of education and awareness.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61706\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/pollock-theater-shows-citizenfour/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61706\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/pollock-theater-shows-citizenfour/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/pollock-theater-shows-citizenfour/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/pollock-theater-shows-citizenfour/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-05/pollock-theater-shows-citizenfour/","id":2866,"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen"},"related":[2865,2864,2863],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Golic Brings “Serbian Fever” to the Pool","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On a team full of eccentric people, senior utility Milos Golic of the men’s water polo stands out above the rest.

He’s unreal.”</p>\n<p>Golic’s road to Santa Barbara began in Serbia, where he played for Partizan — the premier water polo club of Serbia. Golic was also part of the junior Serbian national team where he won a European Championship, essentially making him a part of the best junior team in the world.</p>\n<p>Golic’s club traveled to Florida to play in a water polo tournament, where he met Drac and Janson Wigo, younger brothers of UCSB head coach Wolf Wigo. The Wigo brothers helped Wolf, who went against popular opinion, and recruited Golic.</p>\n<p>“Everyone told him to recruit this other kid,” Golic said. “I had less than a 50 percent chance [of coming to UCSB]. But he [Wolf] understood my madness.”</p>\n<p>Wigo’s decision paid off in the long run. Golic scored 53 goals his freshman year and was named All-American Honorable Mention. He then lead the country in goals scored the next two years on his way to being name to the All-American First team both years. This year, he has already broken the UCSB all time record for career goals, which stood for 27 years and currently leads the conference with 45 goals.</p>\n<p>“He is the best [player] in the nation for sure,” Vincze said. “When he has a great day he is unstoppable and when he doesn’t, he is still really great.”</p>\n<p>Ironically, Golic loathes swimming.</p>\n<p>“I love everything else about water polo,” Golic said. “But I hate swimming. Everybody should know that.”</p>\n<p>However, Golic has not allowed his hatred for swimming to stop him from working hard and influencing the team. The captain’s intensity is relentless and he always expects the best out of everyone, especially himself.</p>\n<p>Golic has been known to scream in Serbian at himself when he makes a mistake.</p>\n<p>“I yell at myself and curse at myself,” Golic said. “It motivates me to push myself harder and get better.”</p>\n<p>Golic’s habit has become quite entertaining to the team, but his use of Serbian is not limited to his little outbursts. Ever since freshman defender Lazar Komandinic, a fellow Serbian, came to the team, the use of Serbian has dramatically increased in practice.</p>\n<p>“The official language of practice is Serbian,” Vincze said. “You hear more Serbian words in practice than English.”</p>\n<p>Golic’s intensity and success extends past the water all the way into the classroom. Despite struggling to learn English upon arrival, Golic has found success through his ability to organize.</p>\n<p>“It used to take me two hours to read what would now take five minutes,” Golic said. “[But] I figured out ho to organize myself … Organization for sure.”</p>\n<p>Now Golic, along with Vincze, has the top grade point average in the entire athletic department.</p>\n<p>“He is very competitive in the classroom,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “Not all athletes can [translate] that athletic intensity into studying.”</p>\n<p>Although Golic has the talent to play professionally, the Serbian native plans on hanging up his Speedo at the end of the year to pursue a masters degree in finance. He has applied to the best finance programs around the world, including schools in England, France and, of course, here in the United States. Some of his top choices include Harvard and Princeton.</p>\n<p>“He is destined for great things,” Wigo said.</p>\n<p>Golic and the water polo team play the second of their four-game road trip against Berkeley on Nov. 6.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28610\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/golic-brings-serbian-fever-pool/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28610\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/golic-brings-serbian-fever-pool/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/golic-brings-serbian-fever-pool/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/golic-brings-serbian-fever-pool/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-31/golic-brings-serbian-fever-pool/","id":2867,"author":{"id":295,"name":"Ryan Eagleson"},"related":[2866,2865,2864],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
