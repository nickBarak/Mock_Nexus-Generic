Is there a way to tell her nicely?</em></p>\n<p>Dear troubled sir,</p>\n<p>You are not alone. People everywhere suffer from a similar problem: being unable to communicate sexual preferences with their partners. The fact of the matter is, people have to learn at one point or another. This girl you’re with probably has no idea that she’s rubbin’ you raw; she probably thinks she’s doing you a favor. Let her know next time because she’s probably not a mind reader (and if she is, she’s probably just a sadist who likes to watch you squirm). It can be as easy as, “Slow down a little,” or “Try to loosen your grip.” You don’t have to make her feel inadequate, just give her some tips so she learns and gets better. I guarantee you that she could give you a few pointers, too, and once that door is open, better sex awaits. Also, don’t forget the positive reinforcement. When something changes for the better, get excited about it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><em>I want to have a threesome with my boyfriend and a friend from back home. I don’t know how to bring this up with my boyfriend, and I’m worried that he’ll take it the wrong way. What should I do?</em></p>\n<p>Threesomes are a lot to handle — that’s a lot of moving parts. This is a sticky topic, no doubt about it because someone always feels left out or jealous, especially when it’s with a serious partner or someone you know well. I would not recommend springing this on him with details, because you might get a “Fuckyousaid?!” if you do. Poke around a little, see how he feels about threesomes in general before you get specific. Then if he seems into it, you can suggest something more concrete, but you have to be prepared for the fact that you still might get a nice, clean “Fuckyousaid?!” Also, you might consider dumping the boyfriend if you’re feeling so sexually attracted to someone else. Either way you decide to go with it, be prepared for things to change in a big way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>From start to finish I’m only getting about 10 minutes in, on average. After seeing all these videos of guys going for like 45 minutes and reading about fucking Sting going for like 36 hours straight, I’m getting the feeling that I’m doing something wrong. Help?</em></p>\n<p>First of all, Sting is a sex machine — literally a mechanical tool, if that is true. I feel so sorry for his partner because the sheer stamina that would take is baffling and somewhat terrifying. Nonetheless, relax! That’s the best piece of advice I can give you. Most studies on the matter show the average and/or optimal duration for intercourse to be contained within the range of three to 13 minutes. Granted, that does not include foreplay, but if you’re actually having sex for 10 minutes, you’re much closer to the optimal time than Sting is … he’s way off. So, take a breather and, if you really are concerned about lasting longer, look into 1) getting in better shape 2) controlling your breathing 3) focusing on your partner instead of yourself. Other than that, take a deep breath and get ready for round two!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This girl told me that she was a virgin, which was fine, but later, when we had sex, she didn’t bleed … was she lying to me?</em></p>\n<p>Don’t worry; she probably wasn’t lying to you. Virginity isn’t about whether or not a girl bleeds when she first has sex, since many girls have “broken” their hymens without ever having sex. Now, I won’t go completely middle school sex-ed class on you, but basically, a girl will bleed during her first time only if her hymen and the tissues around it have never been stretched to the point that they stretch during intercourse. And on a bike-riding, yoga-crazed campus like this one, just think of how many women have already reached that point just from doing their everyday routine. Plus, a lot of the time, that first-time bleeding is actually just because the girl is too nervous, and therefore tense or poorly lubricated. So actually, the fact that she didn’t bleed probably means that she was turned on and comfortable … good on you, mate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>I’m all for a guy being in touch with his feelings, but I recently had sex with this guy for the first time, and he cried afterwards? I really like him, and the sex was good, but I’m not really sure how to deal with this.</em></p>\n<p>When you orgasm, your body is releasing a shit ton of crazy hormones (all scientific terms) into your body. The high levels of dopamine can make you feel gloriously happy and giggly when you climax, or the euphoria can get a little bit overwhelming, and you might end up a little bit weepy. Don’t worry about why it’s happening; it probably confirms that the sex was great for him too. Just know that it’s very common, but also that he might feel a little bit emasculated after this happens. Help his ego out by being vocal about how much you enjoyed it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The guy I’ve been hooking up with is really reluctant to use condoms because he says they make it harder for him to orgasm, so he prefers the pull-out method. I don’t want to get pregnant … will the pull-out method suffice?</em></p>\n<p>What?! <em>Sacre bleu, no!</em> This is where Sam puts hir foot down. Did you learn nothing in sex-ed? First of all, the pull-out method is going to do absolutely nothing to protect you from STDs, so good luck with that. Next, it is definitely still possible for you to get pregnant, even if he doesn’t come inside of you. In fact, literally, the only cool thing about the pull-out method is that you can also call it <em>coitus interruptus</em> … which sounds classy as hell … still not saying you should do it though! So now that you’ve managed to make me sound like your mother, here’s some real advice: If the problem is the condoms, then he should try out some different types; some men prefer polyurethane to latex, or maybe a different shape or size will make a difference. You absolutely have access to condoms here, whether it be at 7-Eleven, or, if they’re sold out of everything but Magnums (it’s happened), at the Student Health center (fo’ free!). And if he keeps insisting on going raw dog, the problem might be him …</p>\n<p><em>Sam the Oracle is all-knowin‘ when it comes to humpin‘.

She kisses his neck, then his lips, finally moving down his torso towards his navel — he immediately pulls down his boxers. As she starts licking his shaft and going down on his member, he grabs her hair and starts moaning in pleasure. Suddenly, he yells in pain, “Teeth … teeth!!!” She pulls off, embarrassed. This now becomes an anxious situation that is all too familiar for many couples who engage in oral sex.</p>\n<p>It’s always been funny to me the way the word “suck” has such a negative connotation in our society. You can “suck” on a test, have a “sucky” TA, “suck” at drinking and of course, “suck” at just that — sucking. In reality, it’s not surprising the number of girls who don’t know how to give good blow jobs or guys who need pointers on eating girls out. More recently, I’ve come to realize that most people don’t know how to give good oral because men and women are built so differently. A guy who hasn’t specifically practiced oral on a girl might not know that the clitoral hood is where he should focus his licking, and some girls I’ve talked to actually think that dome should involve sucking on a penis like a vacuum — ouch! The thought itself makes me happy to be gay. On that note, I can tell you without hesitation that guys have always given me better blow jobs than girls. Looking back to my closet days — yes, there was a time when I thought myself to be straight — I didn’t even like getting head because girls would either suck too hard, squeeze my balls too vigorously or simply leave me in more pain than pleasure. Now I’m just as down for S&amp;M as the next sex-crazed Gaucho, but pain can be really unsettling during a blow job and unless you want to turn your boyfriends gay like my first girlfriend did, you need to know what you’re doing. So here are some tips on the wonders down under, part one of a two-series column regarding oral sex: a bible of sorts on how to stop sucking at sucking.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>1. Contrary to popular belief, a great blow job should entail more non-sucking “up and down” motion on the penis than anything else. I want you to take your dominant hand, make an “o,” place it to your closed mouth with your thumb touching your bottom lip, and move your head forward and backward while rotating your hand. This is exactly what you should be doing for 40-50 percent of a good blow job.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2. While doing this, use your free hand to tickle his balls or stroke his perineum, as this will intensify pleasure by stimulating the nerves all around his groin rather than just those in his dick. Note that I said tickle, not squeeze. Please, for the sake of all men, don’t squeeze — that shit sucks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. About every 15-20 seconds, take your mouth off of his penis and move to the base of his balls. Then, lick along the line separating his left and right nuts, up his shaft and finally to the head of his penis (see tip four). I don’t know what it is about licking the length of a man’s groin that feels so good, but it just does.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. The head of the penis, little do many girls know, is its most sensitive region. When you want to change things up a bit, pull down his foreskin — if he has one — and swirl your mouth around the head while swishing your tongue in circles. If he’s uncut, lick the skin on the back of the head connecting it to the shaft. Uncut men actually experience more pleasure during sex because this flap of skin, called the “ridged band,” is still intact. As such, utilize it whenever possible.</p>\n<p>5. Don’t use your teeth. Ever. No one likes it. I don’t care if Cosmo magazine brings up some cool new technique that involves nibbling his shaft — because yes, I actually read this, and the thought itself makes me shudder — just don’t do it. Tooth-to-dick scraping is easily the number one way to ruin what could’ve been great dome, so practice tucking your lips over your teeth while blowing some phallic object like a banana and know that this will really help you hone your skills.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6. Deep throat feels ridiculously good during a blow job, but not all girls can do it without gagging. I know lots of guys who think that gagging is hot, but I’m pretty sure most wouldn’t be as stoked after experiencing puke dick — yep, it’s a thing. So I’m going to let you in on a little gay man’s secret: whenever I brush my teeth, I brush the back of my tongue as well. This desensitizes that area and makes deep throating even the biggest of dicks a breeze.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>7. If you want to make him come during oral, realize that it is more so the use of your hand rather than your mouth that actually builds up sexual tension in his prostate gland. Shake fast but lightly for 5-10 seconds in between blowing periods if you want him to come, but don’t ever squeeze his penis too hard, as this can be really uncomfortable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8. When he’s about to come — something you’ll know because his abs will begin to flex rhythmically — you have to decide: spit or swallow. While most men I know, myself included, prefer when people swallow, the taste of semen can deter one from doing so. One possible solution? Ask your man to eat pineapples or sweet fruits throughout the day. It might sound weird, but sweet citrus fruits are known to give semen a sweet taste and make it much more bearable to swallow.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>9. Communicate. Good sex is all about communication, and because everyone is different, find out if your man likes what you’re doing and change things up a bit if he doesn’t.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>10. Make sure you get yours. While this isn’t really a tip on giving blow jobs, it’s absolutely ridiculous that some guys expect head without wanting to give it themselves. Heck, I’ve done it and I’m gay. So next time your boyfriend complains about not wanting to eat you out, tell him that if Matt Togni can do it, so can he.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All in all, the key to giving good blow jobs is knowing what does and doesn’t feel good for your man. Girls don’t have penises, so hopefully these tips will help y’all understand what guys generally do and don’t like. Be sure to talk to him about oral etiquette as well, as many girls don’t like when guys press their heads down or pull vigorously on their hair, but never actually tell their boyfriends to stop. For the men reading this, stay tuned for my next column about eating out: I just did all of you a big favor in teaching your girlfriends how to give dome, but let’s not forget that the majority of problems regarding oral sex lie in the fact that it’s you who “suck,” not them.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni wonders what his life would be like now if his first girlfriend gave better head.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, April 2, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

I honestly don’t think I could say exactly. Maybe: no abnormalities, clean, well-proportioned? I’m not looking for a prince-of-the-ball-schlong here, just a handsome contender who knows what he’s doing. What I can assure you does not pop up into my brainstorm bubble is an overwhelmingly large, long, obese penis with a heaping side of engorged meatballs. Think what you will, women just don’t sit around all day fantasizing about being suffocated by a surplus of flesh or painfully walking around like an extra-large dildo was wedged up their asses the night before.</p>\n<p>I know it’s a cliché topic to address, but I can’t say it enough: Size really doesn’t matter — unless you make it matter. If you are constantly thinking about how you don’t size up or how he won’t fill you up, you’ll never come to the realization that sex is ultimately about pleasure, and a big shaft does not equal the big O. Of course, if you were gifted with said giant penis, don’t worry — you don’t have to put up a personals ad for “man seeking woman with enormous vagina to settle down, must like dogs.” Read on, and I’ll tell you why.</p>\n<p>The massive amount of pressure men are under to live up to some dream dick size is extremely unfair, and more importantly, unfounded. First, physically speaking, there is really no advantage to an above-average sized penis, since only the first few inches of the female vagina are pleasure-sensitive. Also, the vagina has an amazing ability to expand and retract, which means the feeling of being “tight” doesn’t require a ten-pound tuna. (And big boys, with enough breathing exercises and moisture, you’ll get it in).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>True, there are women who will talk about how they love a big ol’ one-eyed snake to get the job done, but that is a fetish and should not be confused with every woman’s expectations. And if you are one of these women who badger men with a smaller dish to bring to the table, be sure to keep in mind that though he may laugh it off, it is a very sensitive issue that can be traumatizing for a man.</p>\n<p>Of course, we ladies are in no way immune to society’s obsession with size. Women too are burdened with feeling self-conscious about the size and shape of their breasts, which should be seen as just another beautiful part of a person’s body, not a green light or deal-breaker. However, we have to understand that this pressure is so much different for a man. For a guy, performance in the bedroom is directly connected to self-esteem and self-worth, and having a small organ to begin with can be a stressful starting point. So start by communicating, making him feel more than adequate enough to get your juices flowing.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying “the greatest things come in the smallest packages” necessarily applies here. Rather, “don’t judge a book by its cover.” If you respect the person you are hooking up with, which I am praying that you do, give them a chance to prove your stereotypes wrong. The fact is, all men are not created equal, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Imagination and creativity is not restricted to the shape or size of our body parts.</p>\n<p>Now let’s get some specifics down. I’m sure you’ve all heard expressions like, “It’s not the size of the boat, but the motion of the ocean.” Well, if you are a man who feels inadequately built, try focusing on multiple points of stimulation. Show her that you are strong and can pick her up and move her around. Use your hands to feel her hair, her body, her clit. Even if she was at all caught up about your size, that will all change as soon as you impress her with your ability to arouse her entire body.</p>\n<p>So please, allow these suggestions to shrink your worries about what is really the tiniest of problems. You say less-than-average penis, I say more-than-usual opportunity.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32271\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-26/wise-women-indifferent-extra-long-schlong/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32271\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-26/wise-women-indifferent-extra-long-schlong/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-26/wise-women-indifferent-extra-long-schlong/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-26/wise-women-indifferent-extra-long-schlong/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-26/wise-women-indifferent-extra-long-schlong/","id":6333,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[6332,6331,6330],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"It’s Going Down, I’m Yelling “Tinder!”","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/grindrpic.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/grindrpic.png?resize=600%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Matt Togni explains why dating applications are good for more than just random hookups.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>To many of my straight friends, ending a conversation with a stranger by saying, “Fuck yea … I’m hard just thinking about you cumming over,” would seem really forward and borderline creepy. But in the gay community, apps like Grindr and Jack’d have recently been setting the scene for hookups no matter where you are. Even now, if I open my “dating app” and look at the horny guys nearby probably sitting in their rooms, hands in their pants cradling their hard, thirsty … phones, it’s alarming to think that many of them are less than 1,000 feet away. Gay neighbors on the DL? Possibly. But the fact of the matter is that dating apps are very quickly becoming the norm for people in both the gay and straight communities, with users often looking for more than just casual sex, sometimes even finding relationships with the people they meet.</p>\n<p>When my best friend first showed me Tinder, I immediately equated it to Grindr. For those of you who haven’t heard of Grindr, it’s that phone app you probably see your gay friends on when they’re bored or horny. Its premise is simple: local gay guys have profiles that give you their age, weight, preferences and even distance from you. Whether you talk to other guys on the app looking for a hookup or a date is up to you, but recently, the stigma attached to Grindr is similar to that attached to the gay community as a whole — promiscuous sex. That’s why when my friend showed me Tinder, a similar application that allows users to look through other people’s pictures and either “like” or “dislike” them, I assumed it was based on the same sexual premises as its gay older brother.</p>\n<p>What’s interesting about Tinder is the fact that you aren’t even given the option of talking to another user unless they “like” you back, meaning that there’s an underlying “I like you, you like me” mutual attraction inherent in every interaction. Another thing I noticed about Tinder is that it lacks the headless torsos that pervade the Grindr-verse. To the breeders — gay slang for straights — out there, headless torsos are guys on Grindr whose profiles are just pictures of their shirtless bodies. What usually follows in conversations with these guys are dick pics, followed by more dick pics, with the occasional “I’d pay you ‘x’ amount of money to blow you.” To blow me? Damn, sounds great. But in reality, most of these headless torso guys seem so STD-ridden that touching them with an actual stick is risky, let alone with my own stick. Because something must be wrong with the picture (quite literally) if you can’t even show your face to the person you’re about to bang.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But back to Tinder. What I find most interesting about the app is that a lot of my friends actually go on dates with the guys/girls they meet on it. Now as a guy who’s trying to move past the hookup culture of Isla Vista, I naturally wanted to make my own Tinder to see what it was all about, so one night last week I threw together a profile. First, I added some pictures of me that weren’t so hideous I wouldn’t get matches, but alternately not so hot that people be disappointed seeing me in person. My “about me” was honest and I made it known that I was “down for whatever, but looking for dates.” Then the rating started, where I had the opportunity to like or dislike guys based on their five pictures and short descriptions about who they were. Immediately, I realized that this app was definitely aimed at finding me love, and I laid in bed excited to wake up to the guys who might be “the one.”</p>\n<p>The next morning I woke up to 20-something matches. Stoked, I opened up my Tinder only to find that the majority of the guys I’d matched with were as thirsty as me the morning after a crazy night on DP. I was hoping for something deep; a connection with someone that went farther than wanting to go inside of me. But all I found was the same cheesy “let’s fuck” pick-up lines I was all too familiar with hearing.</p>\n<p>I didn’t respond to most of the guys, but will say that I found a couple that were actually interested in taking me out. What I realized was that there is a silver lining surrounding the negative stigmas associated with dating apps: you’ll get out of them what you put into them. My experiences on Grindr and Tinder in the past have been primarily sexual, but my profiles on both literally say that I am “down for whatever” — granted, probably not the best way to catch a winner in a pond of horny toads. What I’ve come to realize is that by adding a little bit of sexual flair in my profiles to keep my options open, I’ve actually blocked out most opportunities to get guys who wanted something serious.</p>\n<p>For a long time, I believed the stereotype that often defines the gay community — that we’re all a bunch of sex-crazed rabbits looking to get it in whenever possible. And while that may be true for some, in reality, there are plenty of guys and girls out there who really do want to foster serious relationships in college and beyond, many of whom are doing so using apps like Tinder and Grindr every day.</p>\n<p>In closing, I believe that what you get out of dating apps is based on what you put into them. One of my closest gay friends has been in a relationship with his boyfriend for seven months — they’re perfect for each other — and they met on Grindr. One of my roommates though, uses Tinder solely to look for casual sex and I’m trying to find where I fall on this spectrum. So now, I have a date this Thursday with a guy I met on the same app I used to think was just a meeting place for the sexually desperate. In short, whether you’re looking for sex, dates, conversation, a confidence boost or even love, dating apps definitely make good use of the technological age that we’ve all grown up in.</p>\n<p><em>Matt Togni is 753 feet away, horny and “down for whatever.”</em></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Wednesday, January 29, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.
