When given the option, I will choose to watch a good movie and enjoy a glass (or bottle) of red wine over walking the dirty streets of Isla Vista to search for a party. In fact, I secretly take pleasure in soberly going to the liquor store at 9 p.m. on a Friday to buy a pint of ice cream, while already-drunk frat boys and out-of-towners wait to purchase their plastic handles. Or, even better, sitting at Caje drinking a cappuccino and reading for classes until midnight on a Saturday — watching the debauchery occur outside and knowing I will wake up rested and accomplished. In short — I’m not your typical Isla Vista resident. And I love it. Studying abroad is what I imagine it feels like to be those four-day-a-week partiers in I.V. Except you’re in a foreign country. And are expected to travel a lot and do well in school.</p>\n<p>After living in Australia for three weeks without stepping foot in a classroom, semester at The University of Melbourne commenced. My days of waking up late, meeting new friends at restaurants and bars every night of the week, and posting pictures on Facebook to make my American friends jealous were over. They were replaced with 9 a.m. classes, four gigantic readers, job-hunting and going to bed at a reasonable hour. The stress I had hoped to avoid by suspending my responsibilities in the U.S. had returned, something every advisor and former student had failed to mention in our numerous pre-departure meetings.</p>\n<p>Learning that you are expected to travel in addition to living abroad only added to this pressure. It seems more innate in Europe, where you can visit many countries and experience a range of cultures in just one weekend. But travelling is also popular in Southern Australia, where heaps of natural islands and vibrant cities are easily reachable by ferry or plane. After only being in Australia for a few weeks — and still feeling like I’m on vacation — I was faced with starting the travel process all over again. Just thinking about airfares and hostels, forking over large sums of money, and coordinating friends’ diverse class schedules gave me a headache.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This realization that I was expected to travel came as I was cross-referencing the campus map to my class schedule to the best coffee shops in the area. I was just barely settling in! The homebody in me wanted nothing more than to develop a reliable routine: get involved in campus activities, master the tram system and discover my favorite bars and cafes around the city with friends. Also, I actually enjoy my classes and devote much time to reading and writing each week. Just as in Santa Barbara, people in Australia find this very strange, as most students happily blow off schoolwork to travel or hit the beach.</p>\n<p>Last weekend some friends skipped class and flew to Sydney. Other students have rented an RV and driven along the Great Ocean Road or spent a few days on the island of Tasmania. While that all sounds exotic and exciting, I can’t help wanting to settle into city life before jetting off on tropical adventures. For me, drawing lessons and drinks at a local art gallery, a rooftop cinema screening of “2001: A Space Odyssey,” and stand-up at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival sounds just right. While I eventually want to explore all Australia has to offer, the only travel research I want to do in the near future is look up the easiest walking route to class or fastest tram line downtown.</p>\n<p><em>Corie Anderson is a third-year film and media studies major.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/confessions-american-homebody-australia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/confessions-american-homebody-australia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/confessions-american-homebody-australia/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/confessions-american-homebody-australia/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/confessions-american-homebody-australia/","id":6070,"author":{"id":510,"name":"Corie Anderson"},"related":[6069,6068,6067],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":510,"name":"Corie Anderson","biography":"Not available","articles":[6047,6070,6092],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Fifty Shades of Grey: Still a better love story than….actually, not really","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/50-shades-800.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/50-shades-800.jpg?resize=800%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Finally, it’s here.

The mommy-pornographic, masturbatory, former <em>Twilight</em> fanfiction fantasy hit that has taken the sexually-frustrated world by storm: “Fifty Shades of Grey,” the movie.</p>\n<p>Now, to this film’s credit, it is <em>not </em>as bad as the book. The directing, cinematography and soundtrack are fine. All the “inner-goddess” monologues (and all inner monologues in general) are not present, and Christian Grey is not as much of an overt jackass here, but the key phrase is “not as much.” However, saying this movie is not as bad as the book is like saying genital warts are better than herpes. One of them may not burn, but they are both a pain in the ass to have in the first place.</p>\n<p>As mentioned before, E.L. James’ <em>Fifty Shades</em> was originally a <em>Twilight</em> fanfic, and it shows. Anastasia Steele is Bella Swan sans the suicidal tendencies, but she still makes just as many stupid decisions and is about as complex as a Rubix cube with only one color. Same goes for Grey, who can be summed up as a kinky dick. While there are some implications of a darker past — like an unhappy childhood and a teenage love affair — these details mainly seem to be there to trick you into thinking Grey is complex, because the film barely elaborates on these histories.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But it doesn’t matter since complexities don’t excuse the fact that E.L. James wants you to sympathize with a man who breaks into his girlfriend’s house to have violent sex with her as a reaction to rejection. In short, there is about as much chemistry between Grey and Steele as air and more air. If this is romance, getting up to go to the toilet is exercise.</p>\n<p>But, hell, you don’t care. You’ve already made up your mind about whether or not you’re going to see this. And if you do, you just want to watch kinky sex. Well, I got news for you: it’s a letdown. Yes, there is sex. But it’s tamer than you’d be led to believe. None of the sex scenes last longer than two minutes, and there are so many cutaways and fast camera movements during the BDSM (which isn’t represented properly, ask anyone who actually practices it), that you’d get more stimulation out of reading the book instead. And if you were hoping to see how well-endowed Jamie Dornan or Dakota Johnson is below the belt, prepare for disappointment. It’s pretty much a lose-lose situation.</p>\n<p>And that’s the key word here: disappointment.

I was homeschooled so what I was doing was kind of different, but emotionally and psychological, definitely. I was always kind of right there with Mason … that was an incredible outlet to have, everything I went through, and you’re trying to figure out so much, especially as a teenager, and [I was] able to take those things in fiction and look at them somewhat subjectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What do you remember when you were six years old auditioning for this film?</p>\n<p>A: I remembered it was a long audition process and Richard didn’t have the script written or anything. So it wasn’t like most auditions where you go and read lines. It’s just kind of an understanding, he was trying to get to know me … I brought in art and he talked to my parents and it was very casual.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rosamund Pike (“Gone Girl”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Welcome to Santa Barbara. What is your impression of the SB so far?</p>\n<p>A: I had a great time so far. I came up early yesterday morning, we spent a day on beach, had a picnic [and I] went to La Supa Rica last night with my partner. My two sons [are] here, so we’ve just been building sand castles and playing in the waves; it’s wonderful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: This role is such a revolutionary role for women in Hollywood. How does it feel to be chosen to play such a complex character?</p>\n<p>A: It’s just a film about women empowerment, with a bit of murder thrown in for good measure. But take out the murder and a lot of it is about women empowerment. She is sort of an unusual woman who in different circumstances could have been [a] genuinely exceptional human being. It’s just that she has this sort of misplaced sense of entitlement.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I think the point is she is not a monster. She is just sort of [a monster], for the sake of a screenwriter having fun writing this villainous character. [But] she’s totally grounded in reality; I know exactly where she comes from. It’s just the extreme we’re not used to seeing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like to shoot these scenes over and over again? I know David Fincher and he’s a perfectionist.</p>\n<p>A: Well I am [a perfectionist] too, so we had a meeting in mind on the part. I never mind[ed] how many times I had to do it; I’d rather get it right.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like filming that particular scene with Neil Patrick Harris?</p>\n<p>A: That’s the nature of David Fincher filming: his foresight, his planning was like a military operation. We’d do one scene and it [would] be a blood bath, the sides of the set would go up, and the bed would be wheeled out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: How many showers did you take for the scene?</p>\n<p>A: 47 or something.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: You’re such a champion for English designers. Will we be seeing some more English designers for future red carpets, especially at the Oscars?</p>\n<p>A: I’m not going to give anything away but in the near future you will see some English designers coming soon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>J.K. Simmons (“Whiplash”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What did you see in this role of Fletcher that first drew you in?</p>\n<p>A: Everything that an actor is looking for in a part is telling a compelling story, and [playing] a character that I can really sink my teeth into.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Playing an evil character is much more fun…</p>\n<p>A: It can be. But I’m glad I don’t play it all the time because it’s nice to go back and forth and play different types of guys.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Was it fun to slap your co-star Miles Teller repeatedly?</p>\n<p>A: It’s great fun to slap Miles Teller, it’s beautiful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s it like to play different characters and not being put in a box?</p>\n<p>A: That’s always the goal; good writing is always a joy to do. Bad writing is hard to act and when you get boxed in doing a stereotypical character, those could be long days in the office.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: How does it feel to be nominated for an Oscar from a film that was made in only 20 days?</p>\n<p>A: 19 actually. We’re sort of the little movie that could and for the film to be nominated as a Best Picture nominee, Damien to be nominated and Tom, our sound guy [is incredible].</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Damien is only thirty years old, which is pretty young…</p>\n<p>A: He was twenty-six when I first met him, [that’s] when his journey started.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Logan Lerman (“Fury”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: The magnitude of this film — what was it like to work with all these amazing actors?</p>\n<p>A: I felt really lucky to be in good company and they pushed me to play as I’ve ever been before.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Did they teach you anything during the process?</p>\n<p>A: They taught me a lot about myself, my personal limits, what it’s like to break those limits and what happens on camera and in scenes. I learned a lot from them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Were there any pranks going on during the filming?</p>\n<p>A: No, it was a pretty serious set. But it was a great experience, it really was.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Should fans anticipate another Percy Jackson?</p>\n<p>A: Not that I’m aware of. I know the fans would really like it and I really want another one. They’re fun films, they are really fun to make, but I haven’t heard anything about that, so I don’t know. I think we all are getting a little old to play those characters, so I wouldn’t hold my breath necessarily.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>David Oyelowo (“Selma”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Welcome to Santa Barbara, how does it feel to be here?</p>\n<p>A: I love Santa Barbara; I always have a good time every time I come here. It’s nice to come here and get an award.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like to prepare for this role, such an iconic character?</p>\n<p>A: It was challenging but it was also incredibly rewarding. The most rewarding thing is to see people respond so beautifully to the film.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: I know you recently marched with Oprah this past MLK Day in Selma. How did it feel to march down the town’s incredible history?</p>\n<p>A: It was a full circle for us because Selma still has a lot of problems. [It’s] economically deprived [and] there is still segregation down there, not officially, but practically speaking there is. Hopefully the film brings attention to the community in a way that helps it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chadwick Boseman (“Get on Up”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What was it like being a playwright in New York and now getting to play all these iconic characters?</p>\n<p>A: It was two different worlds. As a playwright, it’s just you and your typewriter, it’s you and your character in a room and that it is one of the most exhilarating things you can have when you have a story that is being told to you by your own character. It rivals any moment you can have onstage, moments you can have onscreen when a story is coming through. It’s as exhilarating as being in front of the camera.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: I hope that you do come back to theater.</p>\n<p>A: Who says I left theater. Maybe I’ll go to New York and train with a teacher, do some workshops. All that [can] happen, you just haven’t seen it.</p>\n<p>Jenny Slate (“Obvious Child”):</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: How do you feel when people categorize your film as an “abortion romcom?”</p>\n<p>A: Well you are the only person that has said that to me. I would say that when you see the movie, you’ll see that it is a story about one woman in our world right now. [She’s] making appropriate decisions for herself, and finding joy in that, and finding the complexities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I understand maybe why the media would call it an abortion comedy because it seems like a buzzy phrase. [The phrase] doesn’t mean much to me. As you can see from the work we did, our film is beautiful and complex.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/a-list-celebrities-flood-to-the-arlington-for-virtuosos-award/","id":6068,"author":{"id":721,"name":"Bin Nguyen"},"related":[6067,6066,6065],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Addressing Homelessness","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"My team and I are in outreach on the streets and are deeply concerned about the number of homeless people, including families, entering into our parks, city dwellings, hospitals and beaches.

More new faces, who were formerly housed but now cannot afford local rents, have also poured into their cars and our parks. We are in a crisis.</p>\n<p>People complain about panhandling and hurting businesses, but little to nothing is being done that can affect them for the long term. They cost citizens millions of dollars per year. The key is work. It builds self-worth and is not a hand out but a hand up.</p>\n<p>My team and I decided to bring a few people who have changed all this for their own city. On Thursday, Apr. 12 at 7 p.m. at the Marjorie Luke Theatre we will present two speakers; Eileen Richardson of Palo Alto and her Downtown Street Teams will share how she created jobs for the homeless population in her city. Her successful techniques have been adopted by seven other cities as well. They must be doing something right!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The other speaker will be Richard Le Mieux, author of Breakfast at Sally’s, who was a wealthy businessman who lost it all and became homeless. He will explain his experience and how a chance to work could have prevented his spiraling down. His book is becoming a movie soon.</p>\n<p>If we want to have effective change, then support this effort by coming to listen to what others have accomplished. There might be something in it for our city and county. It’s a free event with free parking. A few hours of your time may be life altering for thousands of homeless in our community.</p>\n<p><em>Deborah Barnes is with Life Saver Services of Santa Barbara.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45853\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-05/addressing-homelessness/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45853\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-05/addressing-homelessness/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-05/addressing-homelessness/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-05/addressing-homelessness/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-05/addressing-homelessness/","id":6069,"author":{"id":531,"name":"Deborah Barnes"},"related":[6068,6067,6066],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
