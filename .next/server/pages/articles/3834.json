April 18, 1:57 a.m. — Deputies responded to a call on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Rd. of someone throwing eggs off a balcony at nearby cars and passersby.</p>\n<p>When officers arrived, they noted a car dripping with egg yolk just as they were welcomed by a descending egg. The 20-year-old male throwing the eggs darted inside the apartment complex as officers ran up the steps. The cops banged on the door until the resident egg-thrower finally opened up.</p>\n<p>“I’m being arrested for throwing chicken at people in the roadway, it’s just chicken, smell my fingers and my breath, this is bullshit,” he announced to the officers.</p>\n<p>After pointing out a completely empty 18-pack of extra large eggs, he continued, “I bought these eggs at the store, I can own eggs.” Officers searched the roadway for chicken or chicken bones. None were found.</p>\n<p>After blaming his escapades on “another dude,” the 20 year old refused to speak further. He was arrested and booked at Santa Barbara County Jail for his “fowl play.”</p>\n<p>The Fightin’ Freshman<br>\nSun. April 18, 12:59 a.m. — Officers responded to a call of an unconscious subject on the 6500 block of Del Playa.</p>\n<p>The male, who was supported by two friends, proved easy to spot. When the cops called out to the inebriated trio, one of the supporters nudged his friend in an effort to elicit a response but instead only caused him to fall to the ground.</p>\n<p>The officers called the paramedics before noticing the smell of alcohol wafting around a 19-year-old resident of the San Miguel Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>When a group of seven males emerged from a nearby frat house to watch the scene, the beer-soaked freshman called out, “Yeah, it’s none of your business, fuck you! Why don’t you go back inside!”</p>\n<p>The freshman and the frat boys began to exchange some heated words. The officer then told the drunken teenager he had two options — leave immediately or face arrest. Apparently looking for a fight, the first-year responded to the request by pushing the officer in the chest and shouting, “Don’t fucking touch me!”</p>\n<p>“Fuck you! Come on, do you want to go?” he asked the officer. And go they did. The deputy told the man that he was under arrest before wrestling him to the ground and handcuffing him.</p>\n<p>After hearing his Miranda rights, the forgetful freshie explained he did nothing wrong and denied any aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p>In response to his arrest, he noted, “I’ve been through this before, you guys aren’t shit!”</p>\n<p>The feisty freshman was transported to Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-23/police-blotter-54/","id":3834,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3833,3832,3831],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell","biography":"Not available","articles":[1284,3495,3499,3521,3528,3569,3575,3577,3578,3580,3809,3810,3834,3836,3837,3838,3840],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun., Feb. 21, 12:42 a.m. -- A manly expletive (\"Fuck!\") drifting through the air on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road caught the attention of patrolling officers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Dishonorably Drunk</b></p>\n<p>Sun., Feb. 21, 12:42 a.m. — A manly expletive (“Fuck!”) drifting through the air on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road caught the attention of patrolling officers.</p>\n<p>Looking around for the source, the deputies spotted a well-built young man staggering down the street, all alone.

The first theft was Friday, May 7 when five laptops were stolen from a residence on the 6500 block of Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>“The suspect entered into the unlocked house,” Padilla said. “I don’t believe it. These kids need to lock their doors and windows.”</p>\n<p>Several other laptops were stolen throughout the weekend.

When the officers arrived some minutes later, they found the sloppy squatter sitting in a large, comfy armchair. The disheveled residents were in the corner, scared.<br>\n\tThe deputies approached the residents who assured the officers they did not know the drunken fool sitting in their living room.<br>\n\tBut when presented with this information, the obtrusive 20-year-old insisted they were in his frat house. And then, as only a frat guy could, he told the officers the others were just mad at him because he was going to take their girls.<br>\n\tThe girls, however, were safe for tonight. After failing to point toward home, the deputies arrested the drunk frat boy and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>The Park Bench Saga</b><br>\nSat. April 3, 12:45 p.m. – Deputies enjoying a sunny afternoon were forced into action when they passed an unusual sight on Embarcadero Del Mar.<br>\n\tThe deputies were walking by a park when they spotted a solitary adult male sprinting around a bench. Upon making a sharp turn, the day-drinker lost his footing and fell on his face.<br>\n\tThe officers approached to check on his welfare, but before they could reach him, the grass-stained 26-year-old rolled over to face the bench and shouted, “I’m going to kick your ass.”<br>\n\tWhen the deputies got closer, they recognized the fallen partier from earlier, when they had issued him a citation for having an open container.<br>\n\tWhen the officers attempted to help him to his feet, he told them he wasn’t going anywhere and fell back down. The deputies disagreed, however, and dragged him to a patrol car, which drove him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Home, Sweet, 109</b><br>\nSun.
