On Sunday the 20th, this was the exact experience that the UCSB Surf Team provided the Isla Vista community with their “Stoked N’ Broke” fundraiser. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fundraiser was held at a house on Segovia Road in Isla Vista, where members of the surf team, their friends and anyone else who wanted to join came together to listen to five talented local bands and musicians perform: Closeout Band, Noise Complaint, Jakob Akira, Art Official and Skogen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While watching the performances, it was clear that the audience was enjoying the music as well as the social, laid-back atmosphere. Gauchos hung out in the backyard mingling, enjoying time together and moving to the groove as the performers entertained them with their unique, varying styles. The majority of the musical genres played that day ranged from punk to the indie/rock realm, with each musician incorporating their different personal characteristics.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Band members Scott Marino and Aran Mazariegos from Art Official displayed great enthusiasm to share their music and put on an unforgettable performance. The formation of the band Art Official evolved out of both longtime friendships and finding new friends with common interests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve actually known the drummer since fourth grade, and we played in jazz band. We played in a bunch of bands in high school and we really wanted to start a band,” Marino said. “We made our lead singer, Jakob, join because we figured he wrote music and sung.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marino continued to tell the story of how he and Mazariegos first connected in the De La Guerra dining commons at UCSB: “He sat down at my table and then we were just talking about music. We were just like, ‘Yo, I love funk music’ and ever since then…,” well, the rest is history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspired by musicians such as Mac DeMarco and Peach Pit, Art Official describes themselves as part of the indie music scene, with a funk and jazz twist given their jazz background. When asked about their hopes for the band in the future, the musicians presented a humble and genuine appreciation for their art and the experience of performing. Describing their goals for Art Official, Marino said, “Honestly, keep playing I.V. shows, and play a lot bigger ones. We actually played our first show last night on DP and honestly, like, we just love doing that. We didn’t really form the band to record or play at huge venues; we just want to play for people who want to hear us.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so many diverse styles among the bands, the audience was constantly entertained with new and original music. Freshman mechanical engineering major Jake Morenc plays for both Noise Complaint and Closeout as a drummer and singer. Playing for two different bands allows Morenc to express his musical skill across different genres. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Closeout is punk/reggae/hard rock and Noise Complaint is metal,” Morenc described of his two musical endeavors. After his last performance of the day, he shared some of the highlights of the event and what he enjoyed most: “My favorite part of today would have to be playing ‘Holiday’ by Green Day and seeing people jump out of their seats to start going crazy! People even started running out of the house ‘cause they heard the song.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judging by the audience’s response to Morenc’s performance, the band definitely knew how to work a crowd, which comes as no surprise given Morenc’s dedication to constantly being involved in the Isla Vista music scene.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been playing shows in I.V. for the past three years, almost every single weekend,” Morenc said. “This one was a lot more laid-back than the ones I usually have, which was a good thing for today actually. I had a great time!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the concert was not only a great way for the Isla Vista community to discover talented local artists but also to provide a substantial amount of support to the UCSB Surf Team as well. UCSB Surf Team President Shaun Tenansnow expressed his gratitude toward the bands and everyone who worked hard to make the event happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The bands were super cool. They’re doing it pro bono, just doing it for free, which is pretty epic for us because we don’t have any money to spend on anything. It’s just $5 to get in which is a pretty mellow price to have a band party, and you’re helping out the surf team which is really helpful for us,” Tenansnow said. Both the team’s and the bands’ abilities to bring people together served as a prime example of the supportive community Isla Vista truly has. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Plaza with some of their distinctive indie-rock music, playing for over an hour and bringing much-needed good vibes to campus. The Honeysticks made the trip to UC Santa Barbara to play some of their more well-known tunes as well as to screen some new songs from their as-of-now unreleased EP by the working title of “Honeysticks 2.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group consists of members Ricky Montgomery (lead vocals, guitar and keyboard), Ben Russin (bass guitar), Larry Scanniello (guitar) and Ryan Fyffe (drums). The Honeysticks initially formed as a touring band under the name, Ricky Montgomery &amp; The Honeysticks, before ultimately shortening their title to their current moniker, The Honeysticks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Honeysticks, who have played shows across Los Angeles in venues such as The Observatory and El Cid on Sunset Boulevard, found a new favorite venue this week at our own humble Storke Plaza. Starting shortly after noon, The Honeysticks drew a hearty crowd to Storke’s steps with their distinctive, bedroom-pop-inspired sound.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout their set, students passing by the University Center stopped and enjoyed the fresh tunes while enjoying their lunches. The Honeysticks’ performance was a welcome addition to the bustling plaza, and their impassioned delivery drew the attention of many passersby. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after finishing their performance in the plaza — after twice conceding “one last song” to enthralled audience members — The Honeysticks were quickly approached by  students interested in getting a chance to meet and greet their members.

Is there any background to it, or was it just catchy?</b></p>\n<p><b>Montgomery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was partly just because we thought it was catchy, but the anecdote I tell when people ask that is: When I was a kid, my sister and I — our parents were divorced — so we’d always be shuffling between houses, so the only kind of anchor point for us was every Saturday morning, we would watch cartoons and eat these sticks of honey … and that was always kind of a moment of homeostasis for me, so I thought that was a cool tone to embody with the band name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also didn’t want something that felt like it was kind of like tonally pigeonholing. Like, I didn’t want a name that was, like, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">edgy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or anything or was trying too hard to be cool … I liked something that was kind of like a non-sequitur.</span></p>\n<p><b>What kind of musical genre do The Honeysticks currently play into? </b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scanniello described the musical scene as “post-genre” and stressed it was hard to give The Honeysticks a definitive label, especially because of their plans to diversify their sound with their upcoming releases.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Scanniello: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially with some of the new stuff, there’s more playing with electronic elements which puts the music more somewhere in the umbrella of indie music.</span></p>\n<p><b>Montgomery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re ultimately an indie band, and right now [The Honeysticks] are trying some experiments with jazz and soul influences, with a little bit of funk in there, too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like I’m trying to figure out how to be a band that comes from an influencer background, while still being innovative artistically and not kind of just an influencer pop-project. We’re working towards a headier take on bedroom pop and a more kind of lush and organic way of expressing the same kinds of values found in that genre. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to pull a quick genre title from that explanation, I suppose.</span></p>\n<p><b>Ricky, you briefly mentioned this earlier, but you said you got started on our late, great social media site, Vine (Rest In Peace). How did you get started there? What kind of stuff did you do?</b></p>\n<p><b>Montgomery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got Vine the day after the app launched in 2013, January 25th. I remember I first found the app because of a CNN article. I had just gotten an iPhone for the first time — I didn’t have a smartphone before then, so I was, like, obsessing over everything — like, I gotta get all the apps I can.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montgomery said he had been interested in the influencer scene before amassing a following on Vine, but that he saw Vine as a springboard for a possible music career. As an early adopter of the social media site, Montgomery readily accepted the opportunity to “define the narrative with the first wave of people using the app.”</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armed with a new following of followers to springboard his musical ventures, Montgomery used the opportunity to craft his musical and songwriting interests into a career, ultimately dropping out of college to take full advantage of the opportunity his Vine following gave him. </span></i></p>\n<p><b>Who are some of your musical influences? Who are you guys listening to, and how do they influence the music you tend to create or gravitate towards, if at all?</b></p>\n<p><b>Montgomery:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Right now, my favorite producer is JPEGMAFIA. I love JPEGMAFIA a lot. I also have been thinking with some of our songs a lot about the album “Trout Mask Replica” [by Captain Beefheart], and like a lot of old, like ‘70s stuff in particular — like Fleetwood Mac and I’m a little bit of jazz from that era. I feel like we’re also getting better as a band, so we’re trying to listen to more technically cool bands.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Band Members also tossed out their individual influences, citing musical groups like MGMT, BADBADNOTGOOD, Wiseblood, Yellow Days and further citing Carlos Santana as one of their strongest musical influences.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Honeysticks told the Nexus they enjoyed playing at Storke Plaza and now that they’ve recently acquired a van (nicknamed Carlos </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Van</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tana), they’re looking forward to touring in the near future after finishing their newest EP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no way [The Honeysticks] won’t come back to Santa Barbara,” they said, assuring the Nexus of their eventual return. Until then, the group has a bright future and plenty of new musical avenues to explore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music by The Honeysticks can be found on Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Amazon Music, TIDAL and YouTube.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/maxmyszkowski/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Storkey.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/maxmyszkowski/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Myszkowski</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Myszkowski is a third-year chemistry major who has an unhealthy obsession with Storke Tower and currently serves as the editor of Nexustentialism.

Despite having undeniably one of the best weeks of my life, I felt like I had missed something, and it definitely wasn’t a shortage of Austin BBQ or spicy fried chicken. Watching a show at Antone’s was an experience in itself, but the whole time I wished that by some miracle Austin-born guitarist, Gary Clark Jr., would make a surprise appearance to the same venue that kick-started his career many years ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remember first watching the musical prowess of Gary Clark Jr. (GCJ) during a concert scene in the John Favreau movie “Chef.” I’ve been charmed and captivated by his guitar skills and vocal range ever since. As a fan of Jimi Hendrix’s psychedelic guitar solos, Grant Green’s jazz scales and ‘70 and ‘80’s blues-rock throughout my musically formative childhood years, GCJ was like a new scoop in an ice cream shop full of timeless flavors that had grown to be well loved but routine. His style is a fusion of blues, soul, R&amp;B and hip-hop with vocal abilities ranging from low ominous grumbles to honeyed high-pitched ballads that have evolved and grown in experimentation throughout his three-album discography. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On tour for his most recent album “This Land,” Gary Clark Jr. electrified, mesmerized and satisfied passionate fans last Friday night at the Santa Barbara Bowl. Filling the entire bowl with his presence makes me wonder how he was able to contain his enigmatic energy in the small bar venues of Austin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An opener worthy of his own show, British singer/songwriter Michael Kiwanuka primed the night for a journey into sweet sounds of symphony, harmony and all the contrasts along the way. Drawing from inspirations like Nirvana and Radiohead, his indie-folk sound also borrows sounds from his Ugandan heritage which come together harmoniously and leave quite an impression on new listeners. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walking opposite of the crowd heading toward concessions to top of their beers before GCJ, I heard several comments: “I mean I knew one song of his, but wow he was really amazing,” “That was an opener? He deserves his own concert!” and “I don’t know what it is, but he made me feel amazing.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90158\" style=\"width: 863px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1271546966\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"90155\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90158\" data-attachment-id=\"90158\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/gary-clark-jr-brings-blues-and-rock-to-santa-barbara-bowl/dsc_0239/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?fit=853%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"853,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0239\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90158\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?resize=853%2C1280\" alt=\"\" width=\"853\" height=\"1280\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?w=853&amp;ssl=1 853w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0239.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90158\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ivan Gonzalez / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, the crowd settled back into their seats, anxiously waiting for Sonny Boy Slim (aka Gary Clark Jr.) to make his way on stage. With all of the roadies and technicals assistant walking on, we knew it wasn’t long.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lights dimmed, then an eerie blue aura covered the stage. Gary’s slender six-foot-five build strutted effortlessly cool onto center stage with his signature heavy cloth beanie, a heavy button up jacket, boots and skinny jeans, immediately receiving an uproar of cheers and an occasional “I LOVE YOU GARY!” or “YOU F***ING ROCK GARY!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joined by bassist Johnny Bradley, rhythm guitarist King Zapata, drummer Johnny Radelat and keyboardist Jon Deas, the group got into position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the iconic opening chords the bowl pulsated in excitement as the group opened with “Bright Lights” from the debut “Blak and Blu” album. The lyrics set the tone for the night as he repeated “You’re gonna know my name by the end of the night.” Riding off the energy from the first track, they followed up with “Feelin’ Like a Million” and “Low Down Rolling Stone” off of “This Land.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each lull in his music, excited yells of “I LOVE YOU!” could be heard amongst the crowds. The energy of the performance fluctuated between making you feel like you were in the back of a small bar in Austin, hearing some world-class blues among an old wooden exterior with deep blue lights, to making you feel like you were in love at a Valentine’s Day dance, with pink lights and melodies reminiscent of oldies your parents listened to.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90157\" style=\"width: 863px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1643460533\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"90155\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90157\" data-attachment-id=\"90157\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/gary-clark-jr-brings-blues-and-rock-to-santa-barbara-bowl/version-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?fit=853%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"853,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Version 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90157\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?resize=853%2C1280\" alt=\"\" width=\"853\" height=\"1280\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?w=853&amp;ssl=1 853w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Version-2-1.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90157\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ivan Gonzalez / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guitar solos would grip the crowd into a trance as we watched Gary grip his guitar neck feverishly with wild expressions on his face, showing the passion and energy he was putting out. Equally as captivating was Jon Deas who entered a few piano solos that kept the crowd jumping, swaying and letting it all loose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An exposition of his new album, the songs all varied in themes and feelings that I can only describe as like driving a ‘69 Camaro through a desert, in a thunderstorm of emotions, eventually reaching a point of peace marked by clouds clearing and exposing a sunset of serenity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guitar solo after guitar solo, the crowd cheered “Gary! Gary! Gary!” before he exited the stage, which to everyone’s excitement wasn’t the end as he came back out once again for an encore. Thanking both his “squad” and the crowd for an unbelievable night, Gary exclaimed, “Representing Austin, Texas everywhere I go!” and ended the night with classics like “When My Train Pulls In” and a hard-hitter cover of “Come Together.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary’s new album highlights his creativity and range in creating crowd-pleasing songs that also touch on the political landscape and black experience of growing up in Texas. Despite being 1,500 miles away from Austin, the Santa Barbara crowd showed so much love and energy for Gary Clark Jr. that it almost felt like I was back among the crowd in Antone’s.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Last year, it was Billie Eilish. A couple of years before that, it was Post Malone. All of these artists are, of course, ultra successful within the music industry. All of these artists have also been subjected to a torrent of online ridicule and skepticism by way of overzealous Redditors and Twitter users. Granted, this is true of pretty much any celebrity. Some of the criticism, however, is reserved for a particular group of performers — those labeled as “industry plants.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first came across this term when I had the song “3 Nights” by Dominic Fike on repeat, which I had discovered through Apple Music’s “Up Next” playlist. Wanting to know more about the genius behind the breezy, infectious track and why I had never heard of him before, I searched on Google to find that Fike had been offered a multimillion-dollar deal from Columbia Records without any music officially released.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term “industry plant” refers to an artist who appears to have slowly accumulated a loyal fan base over a significant length of time, but upon closer inspection, has no clear origin story. Coined by the hip-hop community several years ago, the phrase is most often used to undermine an artist as being nothing more than a pawn in a record label’s quest for industry domination.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With connections across the board and millions of dollars at their disposal, major labels can essentially promote any artist through streaming, radio play and media coverage. Some fans and critics are convinced that these labels scout artists they believe to be the most marketable within a certain genre and put all of their resources behind them, deceiving listeners into thinking the artist has an organic following.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is it that being labeled an industry plant can plague a career when the concept is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">similar to an artist’s big break into the music business? Simply put, fans like to know exactly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who it is that they are rooting for. Where an artist comes from is just as important as the music </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itself, especially within the hip-hop and alternative music community. In contrast to pop music, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which has been engineered to appeal to the masses, these two genres target a more specific </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">audience with the messages embedded in their songs. Through their music, artists often allude to struggles in their life which fans can relate to, and their credibility comes from their experiences.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90347\" style=\"width: 1450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clairo.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"312069378\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"90285\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90347\" data-attachment-id=\"90347\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/the-significance-of-industry-plants-in-the-music-community/clairo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clairo.jpg?fit=1440%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"clairo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clairo.jpg?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clairo.jpg?fit=888%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-90347\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clairo.jpg?resize=888%2C444\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clairo.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clairo.jpg?resize=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clairo.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clairo.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-90347\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Pitchfork</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indie-pop singer Clairo, who rose to fame after the viral recognition of “Pretty Girl” on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube, has long been accused of being an industry plant due to her father’s close relationship to Fader Label. Many fans questioned whether YouTube’s algorithm system was the only factor in her unforeseen success, or if her father’s connections played a role in how she was marketed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicago native Chance The Rapper, who has branded himself as an independent artist throughout his career, reached new levels of success after the release of “Coloring Book” in 2016, which was highly anticipated and heavily advertised. His first project, however, dates only four years before. His constant presence on music blogs since the very beginning of his career and his unprecedented success without a contract has led many fans and critics to suspect that there is someone else pulling the strings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, accusations of being an industry plant rarely have a significant effect on an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">artist’s career. Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts” has sat atop the Billboard Hot 100for five weeks, Eilish’s debut album was met with universal acclaim and Post Malone’s “Hollywood’s Bleeding” has had the biggest streaming week of 2019. Regardless of the truth behind an artist’s come-up, fans will stream and support the music that they like. So, the question that remains is, does it matter if an artist’s origin story is not as authentic as it is presented to the world?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking a look at the industry right now, all of these performers have had a banner year. Their music dominates the radio airwaves and regularly tops the charts. They are all marketed aggressively online and on social media. They are all, of course, signed to major music labels. With a broad arsenal available to them, it only makes sense that these labels capitalize on their </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">resources and connections to monopolize the industry. They know what the fans are looking for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and how to sell it to them. In this sense, it does not matter how organic an artist’s story is. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accusations of being an industry plant deter very few fans from supporting their favorite artist </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and do nothing to hinder an artist’s exposure. At the end of the day, the big-name executives </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and labels retain their power, and fans have something else to argue about on their Twitter feeds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether or not the concept of an industry plant actually exists, there is no doubt that major record labels are constantly on the lookout for the next breakout star, and there is no doubt that these labels carry more leverage than smaller, independent labels. As long as these artists continue to release the quality of music expected of them, they can count on the support and admiration of their fans, regardless of which Big Three label is backing them.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DailyNexusStaffPortrait.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sunidhi-sridhar/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sunidhi Sridhar</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sunidhi Sridhar serves as the Artsweek editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
