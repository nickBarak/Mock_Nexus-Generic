His newest film “Da 5 Bloods” is extremely political, and like his other films, focuses on Black struggles and oppression. Any history buff would enjoy it, but I recommend the film to everyone because the issues examined in it are unfortunately still prevalent today; especially right now with the new wave of the Black Lives Matter movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 5 Bloods are a group of five black men who were sent to fight for America during the Vietnam War. The film focuses on Paul (Delroy Lindo), Paul’s son David (Jonathan Majors), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), Melvin (Isiah Witlock Jr.), and Norman (Chadwick Boseman). The film opens with a clip of Muhammad Ali, who famously condemned the killings of people abroad because unlike the United States, those countries “never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob me of my nationality.” This starts a montage overlapped with Marvin Gaye’s voice, which is the first time of many he is heard in the film. There are clips of Black soldiers, war scenes and historical moments that happened around the time of the war, which was fought from 1955 to 1975. Then, there are photo inserts of Martin Luther King Jr., Angela Davis and Malcolm X, whose speeches are sprinkled throughout the movie, along with references to Black riots in response to injustices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Netflix preview I got the impression that the film was going to be primarily set during the Vietnam War, but instead it focused on the Bloods during modern-day America, and their time in the war was only briefly shown through flashbacks. Norman was killed during the war, so the other four Bloods return to Vietnam to find his body and the gold they buried about 40 years prior. One of Spike Lee’s most interesting cinematographic choices was to film the flashbacks with the same older actors that portray the four Bloods as in the present-day plot, instead of using younger ones in their place. In my opinion, this was a better choice because the four men were recalling their time in Vietnam and all were able to see themselves as the age they are, but they only remember Norman as young. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire journey in Vietnam brings back memories of the torture that the Bloods went through when they were young soldiers. They show symptoms of the PTSD they still experience, and though they seem proud to call themselves Americans, they also express the disgusting oppression they’ve been subjected to their entire lives. The war is also constantly referred to as the “American War” by the Vietnamese people, who still hold resentment towards the U.S. Yet, both sides show bitterness to each other still to this day; and as the Bloods’ tour guide discloses, “After you’ve been in a war, you understand it never really ends,” which the audience sees through the Blood’s own nervous breakdowns and in tense moments between them and Vietnamese locals who claim the men killed their families. Paul specifically becomes livid at the locals’ statements, and it is only at the end through his visions of Norman that he is able to own up to the truth of his corrupt time in the military. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Norman wasn’t only one of the 5 Bloods but also their leader, teacher and preacher. Otis explained he gave the bloods “Something to believe in. A direction, a purpose. He taught us about Black history when it wasn’t really popular back then… Yeah, he was our Malcolm and our Martin.” Norman emphasized peace and justice but wasn’t afraid to show his frustration with the treatment of Black people in America, and who better to have as the heroic idol of the group than the Black Panther himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During one of his many teachings, Norman stressed that “War is about money. Money is about war. Every time I walk out my front door, I see cops patrolling my neighborhood like it’s some police state. I can feel just how much I ain’t worth.” Black men were sent to Vietnam to fight for a country that was not fighting for them. They were fighting for the rights that they weren’t yet granted, and they were sent to die. Black and brown men disproportionately died during the war, because they were disproportionately sent. As Otis explains to Paul’s young son David, “White boys who stayed in college, they’d dodge that shit. They put our poor Black asses on the front lines, killing us off like flies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Da 5 Bloods” deals with emotional trauma caused because of the war, trust issues, complex relationships with fathers and the many and seemingly never-ending injustices experienced by Black people in America. While not my favorite Spike Lee movie, it was still an enjoyable and beneficial watch. The film takes a different approach to Vietnam War films, most of which focus on the hardships of white soldiers and may portray one token Black actor. They too often ignore and erase the Black men who were thrown into an unjust war and died for a country that didn’t care about them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film reflects on how little change has happened since the Vietnam War, and how Black people in America still have to worry about losing their lives and lack of full rights every single day. Justice is slow, and because of that many of us get burnt out and discouraged, but we must continue to fight for our rights. Part of Netflix’s new Black Lives Matter category, the release date of “Da 5 Bloods” couldn’t have been at a more fitting time, and watching films that address systemic racism still prevalent in American society is a great way of educating yourself about Black issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 3.5/5 </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff9771f991113650d9761d1e81fce88?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/lilianalinan/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Liliana Linan</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Liliana loves watching films, listening to music, and obsessing over Timoth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">é</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">e Chalamet.

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As future leaders, we all have a responsibility to do what we can to advocate for solutions to climate change. With approximately $3 billion invested, the University of California system is in a powerful position to influence the fossil fuel industry as an important shareholder. When one divests on moral or ideological grounds, one guarantees that the assets will be controlled and managed by a new party that cares less about the ideas and morals that led to the divestment. In the United States, the boards of directors of public corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to seek profits for the common shareholders. If the owners (shareholders) of the fossil fuel industry do not care about climate change, the companies are legally obligated to similarly not care. Rather than divest, the UC system should exercise its role as a prominent shareholder to pressure fossil fuel companies to adopt more forward-looking policies to address climate change.</p>\n<p>Previous divestment efforts have proved largely ineffective as a strategy to curtail undesirable practices among corporations. In the past, there was a national effort to divest from the tobacco industry due to the known public health consequences of tobacco consumption. Aside from negative publicity, divestment efforts were largely inconsequential. In fact, depressing an industry’s stock prices due to large-scale divestment tends to boost the return on equity available to the remaining shareholders through more effective share buybacks and dividend reinvestment; Philip Morris (now Altria) was one of the highest returning stocks of the past 50 years. The real success of the anti-tobacco movement in the United States, aside from public smoking bans, arose from targeted health advocacy to disseminate information on the negative health effects of smoking.</p>\n<p>The energy industry contains some of the world’s most highly qualified scientists, skilled workers and engineers who work on the most challenging problems of our generation. The mission of the energy sector is to efficiently and safely implement proven technologies in pursuit of affordable energy. For the first time, we are beginning to see renewable energy emerge as a viable large-scale commercial option. Our generation is accustomed to rapid progress and is understandably frustrated by the snail’s pace of the energy sector. However, the energy grid is comprised of hundreds of billions of dollars of existing infrastructure and has been developed for over a hundred years; it is not amenable to rapid change.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Moreover, as an educated student body, we must carefully articulate what it is we hope to achieve and view the energy sector with long-term objectives. For instance, the Obama administration opposed the expansion of many activities such as the use of Canadian oil sands, coal power generation and oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean because these activities have a relatively high environmental impact. On the other hand, the Obama administration strongly encouraged the expansion of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” as a transitional technology to the renewable age. In fact, the United States’ carbon emissions declined by 12 percent from 2005 to 2015, due to the increased use of natural gas over coal for power generation. </p>\n<p>A recent article in the Daily Nexus claimed that Chancellor Henry T. Yang has endorsed Fossil Free UCSB in its calls for divestment. His statement has been misconstrued; he did offer his support to the activists, but he did not explicitly endorse a divestment from fossil fuel industries.<br>\n“I stand by our students who have been sitting in calling for fossil fuel divestment this past week and support their aims … In the coming week, I look forward to working with my fellow chancellors in support of a thorough and transparent discussion on divestment from fossil fuels as part of the UC’s approach to combating the climate crisis.”</p>\n<p>It is encouraging to see an administrator engaged with the student body, although his response leaves much to be desired. As a highly qualified engineer and scientist, Chancellor Yang could use this opportunity as a teaching moment to provide more direction to the activists. Under President Donald J. Trump, research institutions and regulatory agencies are under assault, and now more than ever we need common-sense actions on climate change. Above all, I commend the organizers of Fossil Free UCSB for their impressive achievement and successful display of civil disobedience, but I suggest a more constructive approach. Lobby for new policy to clarify the UC system’s relationship with fossil fuel industries, and engage the regents to commit strongly to climate advocacy in their capacity as shareholders. This includes advocating for increased funding of renewable energy initiatives and fundamental research at our universities and national laboratories, improved regulatory oversight for fracking wastewater disposal and other pollutants and a “revenue-neutral” tax on carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>Even if it otherwise makes sense to divest, the chancellors must consider the impact divestment is likely to have on our community. The UC system has a responsibility to its students and to the California taxpayers to effectively manage its resources in pursuit of its strategic mission. Divestment on moral grounds reduces the universe of potential investments, and this can only decrease the returns available to the overall portfolio. Can the chancellors demonstrate that the opportunity cost of divesting from fossil fuels does not significantly impact the growth of our system’s endowment or the quality of our institution?<br>\nNathan Prisco is a second-year graduate student in the Department of Chemical Engineering at UCSB.

First of all, the UC doesn’t hold enough investments in any one company to significantly influence companies via its shares. Second, this tactic has been tried, and in this case, companies will not listen to a shareholder engagement strategy that asks them to forgo their bottom line and completely restructure their business model.</p>\n<p>Claim 2: “Previous divestment efforts have proved largely ineffective as a strategy to curtail undesirable practices among corporations.” Many critics of divestment keep conveniently forgetting that the goal of divestment is not about shifting the money and starving the industry of stock value, but rather about the immense cultural shift that results from a respected and powerful institution like the UC deciding to no longer invest in companies that are threatening the futures of the students of their intuition. Making such a claim erases the history that divestment played in bringing on the end of apartheid in South Africa, in pushing the UC to no longer be a passive observer of human rights abuses but to instead stand against white supremacy. On Nelson Mandela’s first visit to the United States after being released from prison he thanked the students at UC Berkeley for their roles in the divestment from apartheid movement. Finally, the tobacco divestment campaign played a crucial role in the public relations struggle over the health impacts of tobacco and directly helped shift cultural norms around smoking. Today, thanks to the cultural shift divestment brought about, it would be scandalous for a university to invest in tobacco.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Claim 3: “The mission of the energy sector is to efficiently and safely implement proven technologies in pursuit of affordable energy.” The fossil fuel industry exists to meet its bottom line. This industry is responsible for oil trains which have derailed and killed innocent bystanders; for increased rates of asthma, cancer, and cardiovascular illness in communities living near power plants; for the mass disregard for people whose livelihoods depends on their environment, as seen with the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the destruction of native lands for the production of tar sands, and the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. We cannot claim that these companies exist for the public good when Exxon created a massive disinformation campaign, hiring Big Tobacco’s top PR firms to discredit the best climate scientists. Why, exactly, should the UC be investing in that level of destruction?</p>\n<p>Claim 4: “We must carefully articulate what it is we hope to achieve…” I applaud this point and the divest-invest movement has garnered so much public support because it doesn’t only focus on what is bad, but also actively pursues investment alternatives into climate justice solutions. This includes investing in community choice energy, education, and renewable startups. As a society, we need to get better at articulating our vision for what kind of world we want to live in; we need to divest from the problem and invest in the solutions.</p>\n<p>Claim 5: “On the other hand, the Obama administration strongly encouraged the expansion of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” as a transitional technology to the renewable age.” Fracking has no place in the low-carbon, just transition that we need as a society. The technology was developed to extract the little remaining oil and gas from nearly depleted wells and has been linked to increases in the frequency of earthquakes, the contamination and waste of precious groundwater, and the destruction of local economies in the boom and bust cycle. Moreover, the fuels being extracted by fracking are still contributing to the climate crisis: natural gas releases methane which, while having a shorter atmospheric residence time, has a stronger global warming potential than carbon dioxide, and in California, fracking is used to extract dense, tar-like oil that releases far more carbon dioxide than conventional oil.</p>\n<p>Claim 6: “UC system has a responsibility to its students and to the California taxpayers.” This statement is absolutely true. Investments in fossil fuels are risky because much of the industry’s reserves will become stranded assets, and hence financially unviable, leading to what experts in the field call a “carbon bubble” when appropriate climate legislation is finally introduced. The UC’s responsibility and its mission – both to the students who must be forced to live with the consequences of climate change, and the people of California who have overwhelmingly demanded climate action – should be aligned with its investment practices.</p>\n<p>How, then, can the UC defend actively investing in companies that are driving climate change which has been attributed by brilliant climate scientists to contributing to the California drought, Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Sandy, all bearing heavy costs for this country?</p>\n<p>Students have been actively lobbying for fossil fuel divestment since August 2012, have sat in closed-door meetings with Chancellors, Regents, investment officers, and sustainability officers, and have garnered the support of over 700 faculty UC-wide, 9 A.S. senate resolutions, 3 Academic Senate resolutions, and now the support of 4 Chancellors. Suggesting that the campaign should focus more on being “constructive” and “lobby” instead of using civil disobedience ignores the entire history of the campaign.</p>\n<p>But I don’t blame Prisco for buying into that idea. Our history books have an unfortunate tendency of tidying up how real transformation happens. Systemic change – such as civil rights, the New Deal, and women’s suffrage – doesn’t happen because a group of people politely sit down in a meeting with key decision makers. It happens because those who dare to dream negotiate and demonstrate until human and environmental rights are achieved.</p>\n<p>The fossil fuel industry owns five times more coal, oil, and gas than even the most conservative climate scientists suggest is safe to burn, meaning that 80% of fossil fuels must remain below ground if we are to have any chance of avoiding climate catastrophe. Combatting climate change and the catastrophic poisoning of our communities, water, air, and land has no easy solution. Meaningful change is a long and bumpy road, and Chancellor Yang, accompanied by the chancellors from UCSC, UCSD, and UCD, should be applauded for making bold commitments that are appropriate for the severity of the crises we face. While divestment won’t solve the climate crisis nor repay those who have been sacrificed in the name of cheap energy, it is a meaningful catalyst for change.</p>\n<p><em>Emily Williams is a graduate student in Geography.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77978\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77978\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/why-the-uc-system-should-not-divest-from-fossil-fuels-a-response-to-nathan-prisco/","id":6261,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[6260,6259,6258],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"In Review: “8:46” by Dave Chappelle","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2020-06-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/davechappelle-1-1592000080399.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/davechappelle-1-1592000080399.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The special comes in the wake of nationwide and worldwide protests denouncing the murder of George Floyd and police brutality and systemic racism against Black Americans as a whole.

(The special can be accessed on Netflix’s YouTube channel, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tR6mKcBbT4&amp;t=6s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The special comes in the wake of nationwide and worldwide protests denouncing the murder of George Floyd and police brutality and systemic racism against Black Americans as a whole, with renewed calls for justice for Black Americans who have lost their lives to police officers that engaged in excessive behavior. It also comes in the middle of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with the first few shots showing temperature checks being conducted at the door and socially distanced seating at the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The special begins with Chappelle recounting his experience with the Northridge Earthquake, a 6.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the San Fernando Valley region back in 1994. He recalls the tremors lasting about 35 seconds, and even for such a seemingly short time, he thought he might die, and it was one of the most terrifying experiences of his life. It becomes harrowing, then, to try to imagine what George Floyd went through in the eight minutes and forty-six seconds that preceded his death. More so, Chappelle uses the moment to raise questions about what an incident like this — an almost nine-minute long murder in broad daylight with multiple bystanders — says about a society in which a man could do that do another man and “not feel like he was going to get the wrath of God.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Chappelle, the riots and protests engulfing the nation and world right now have been a long time coming. He responds to criticism from Don Lemon, a commentator for CNN, who asked why more celebrities haven’t been speaking out, to which Chappelle questions the very need to look to (often </span><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/celebrities-racism-i-take-responsibility-video.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clueless</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) celebrities for leadership, observing that “the streets are speaking for themselves right now.” He also responds to Black conservative firebrand Candace Owens, who released a video refusing to embrace George Floyd, a convicted criminal, as a martyr or hero for Black America. Chappelle angrily counters, stating that he does not care what George Floyd did. George Floyd was simply the man that this grave injustice was committed against, and that is why his name is in the papers. He remarks, in one of the more poignant moments of the show, “we aren’t desperate for heroes in the Black community. Any n***a that makes it through this nightmare is my goddamned hero.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worth noting here is that this is far from the typical material in Chappelle’s standup, yet does perhaps the best job of all his material at communicating how Dave Chappelle, a Black American, feels about the world he has to face every day. With over 24 million views at the time of writing, it’s also a clear symbol of how much people trust and respect his voice. As someone used to seeing aggressive polarization at every turn of the world, it was genuinely astonishing for me to see neither Don Lemon nor Candace Owens get very defensive over the jokes, and actually independently express their honor and joy at being memorialized in a Dave Chappelle special and to reiterate their belief that he is one of the greatest comedians of all time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of trust is rare, to say the least, and doesn’t seem to be something Chappelle takes for granted. He explores this in the special, recognizing that people seem to trust him because the realness of his jokes make people feel like he’s not lying to them. Yet, he points out, every institution that the people are supposed to trust, from the police to the government, lies to them on almost every level. He ponders the idea that maybe it’s time we figured out better voices to listen to and found better ways to get people to listen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s pretty incredible to see Chappelle pack in this many emotions, jokes and meaningful moments of social commentary into a comedy special that clocks in at a little under 30 minutes. If you’ve seen Chappelle’s old specials tackling the material of police brutality (his 2000 special “Killin’ Them Softly” is hilarious and outstanding), it’s really interesting to view “8:46” as a mature conclusion to those same ideas. Rather than adding to his arsenal of jokes on the topic, this special more somberly lays out his grief at the repeated injustices that Black Americans have to live their entire lives in fear of being victims of. Approaching the topic with a unique combination of sensitivity, moments of light-heartedness and hurt resignation, “8:46” makes for some of Chappelle’s most profound social commentary yet. In today’s cascade of conflicting and angry voices, I think his views are, at the very least, a perspective to deeply consider, regardless of your political views.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 9.5/10</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94941\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94941\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-20/in-review-846-by-dave-chappelle/","id":6262,"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit"},"related":[6261,6260,6259],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
