Both the decision to divest from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy were made under this policy, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe the university and its stakeholders are much better served by investing in promising opportunities in the alternative energy field rather than gambling on oil and gas,” Richard Sherman, chair of the UC Board of Regents’ Investments Committee, said in the press release.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bachher also noted in the press release that the journey to divestment took a significant step when the UC sold off its investments in coal and oil sands one year after the UC Investment Office adopted the ESG policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to concern from investors about the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on fossil fuel stock prices, Bachher said in the press release that the UC’s divestment represents an important turning point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we certainly could not have predicted the speed nor depth of the recent downturn in the traditional energy sector, signs point to a structural shift — not merely another cycle of boom or bust,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bachher also said in the press release that the “lowered demand and oversupply” of fossil fuels “could portend an even longer price drought in oil and gas” as the world recovers from the pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, the UC investments team is committed to growing its investments in sustainable practices such as renewable energy, waste conversion, sustainable agriculture and technology associated with these goals, the press release stated. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In that game, junior guard Keilanei Cooper led the way with 23 points, while star redshirt-senior guard Jannon Otto chipped in 14 points as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This time around, the Gauchos’ perimeter defense completely nullified the two guards. On the night, Cooper finished with a mere 2 points, shooting 1-11 from the floor in one of her least efficient performances of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But perhaps the biggest reason for the ‘Chos blowout victory was the defense of redshirt senior Coco Miller, who was tasked with the unenviable job of guarding Otto. Coming into the game, Otto ranked second in the conference with 16.6 points per game. An elite scorer, Otto has been highly efficient all year, shooting 35% from deep and 86% from the free-throw line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None of that mattered to Miller on Saturday — she completely nullified Otto in the first half. At halftime, Miller had collected 5 steals; in comparison, Otto had only scored 4 points on 2-7 shooting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought [Miller] was unbelievable on defense,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “She stayed with Otto like velcro.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Otto actually finished the game with 17 points on the night, a majority of that production came with the game well out of reach. With Otto struggling to find her footing on offense, the Riverside offense limped to only 15 points in the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversely, the Gauchos had one of their finest offensive first halves in recent memory, with the team scoring a resounding 40 points in the first half. Yet again, freshman Ila Lane demonstrated her resounding talent on Saturday, contributing 17 points and grabbing 12 rebounds en-route to her 17th double-double on the season. After the performance, Lane now leads the nation with 13.1 rebounds per game on the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So much of post play is positioning; [Lane] was good early and the passes were on time and on target,” Henrickson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player who excelled all night was freshman Johnni Gonzalez. While the stat sheet won’t reflect her overall impact, Gonzalez helped to control the tempo of the ‘Chos offense all night — especially when junior guard Danae Miller left with an injury. In total, Gonzalez finished the game with 8 points on 3-6 shooting, including a deep buzzer-beater 3-pointer that gave the ‘Chos a 25-point lead at the half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Tal Sahar also continued her recent hot streak on the offensive end, scoring 16 points off the bench on Saturday. In one of the most impressive plays of the entire game, Sahar hit a dream-shake fadeaway jumper that gave UCSB a 54-25 lead in the third quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Riverside chipped away at the Gaucho’s lead in the fourth quarter, it was ultimately a story of too little, too late for the Highlanders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first time all season, UCSB sits in sole possession of third place in the conference after winning its third straight game on Saturday. Next, the Gauchos travel to Cal Poly on Wednesday, looking to sweep their rivals. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yvette Gullatt, vice provost for Diversity and Engagement and chief outreach officer for the University of California, said the special committee is concerned with both “articulat[ing] our concerns while also moving forward” and has delayed discussion about its recommendations for the UC Regents September meeting, when the committee would be evaluating how pertinent their recommendations have proven to be. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One goal of the new recommendations is to “advocate for greater investment in financial aid at the federal, state and university levels.” Paired with the timing of the coronavirus pandemic, additional financial aid could serve to reduce the financial burden many UC students are currently experiencing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC has currently been allocated $260 million through the federal C.A.R.E.S. act, $130 million of which was allocated to campuses for the distribution of emergency grants for students, according to Director of Student Financial Support Shawn Brick. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Student Regent Hayley Wheddle, the head of the Special Committee, spearheaded the basic needs report over her year-long term; Tuesday’s meeting was her last as a student regent. She commended the UC on “proactively looking to fill the gaps” in financial aid, as the committee aims to push federal funding going forward, according to the committee’s draft recommendations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the meeting, presenters and speakers emphasized the need to utilize CalFresh, which can now be used to purchase online groceries, and the possibility of waiving the 20-hour per-week work requirements that are usually necessary to qualify for the food assistance program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their drafted recommendations emphasized the importance of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maximizing overall enrollment in CalFresh through “running large-scale onsite CalFresh enrollment clinics,” as well as “training county departments of social services workers to support UC students with CalFresh application and enrollment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the committee hopes to assist students who are not eligible for CalFresh with various on-campus programs and aims to close the 22% gap in food insecurity between first-generation and non-first-generation students, according to the report.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campuses have been made responsible for UC students who are now, due to moving back to their hometowns, closer to a different UC campus than the one that they are enrolled in. According to the committee Co-Chair Tim Galarneau,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> UC students can receive certain services on any given campus such as meal swipes, bagged grocery pickup, temporary housing and emergency grants regardless of which campus they’re enrolled at.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But because of the coronavirus pandemic, Galarneau said, many campuses are inherently under-equipped for “daily uncertainties and major changes to resources, policies, processes, and decision making” as a result of limited staffing and uncertainty surrounding future funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With basic needs providers on college campuses designated as first responders to the coronavirus pandemic, the Special Committee on Basic Needs hopes to address the challenges the UC is facing with help from local campuses and their basic needs providers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our basic needs movement is a nascent one, coinciding with natural disasters and a pandemic, coinciding when food security and a sense of community have been needed the most,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gullatt said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is changing as the needs of students change.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.
