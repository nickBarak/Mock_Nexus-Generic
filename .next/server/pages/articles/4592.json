id=\"caption-attachment-70557\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Del Playa” seems to some a mistranslation of “to the beach,” which is “de la playa” in Spanish. <em>McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Fernanda Cerrato, a second-year political science major, moved into her apartment on Cordoba Road in September 2015, she could not help but notice the seemingly incorrect</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Spanish in many of the surrounding street names—“Del Playa” appeared to her an incorrect version of “de la playa,” which means “to the beach” in Spanish.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cerrato was born in Sonora, Mexico, and moved to a Mexican-American neighborhood of Oxnard, Calif. at 14. She now notices when people pronounce “El Colegio” with a hard “g” instead of the “h” sound used by native Spanish-speakers.</span></p>\n<p>“Everyone knew how to pronounce things in Spanish” in Oxnard, Cerrato said. “People here don’t try whatsoever to pronounce the names correctly.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bad Spanish seems to be abundant in Isla Vista’s street names, and historians say that these mistranslated titles are the work of I.V.’s earliest developers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landowners Pauline and John Ilharreguy built and named the four major streets that run parallel to the bluffs — Del Playa Drive, Sabado Tarde Road, Trigo Road and Pasado Road — in 1925.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spanish street names and “Isla Vista” were intended to keep with the Spanish colonial theme then in use by much of Santa Barbara as it rebuilt itself following the 1925 earthquake.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several I.V. historians agree that the Ilharreguys were probably not good at Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista” is Spanish for Island View, but is not grammatically correct, and “Sabado Tarde” was supposed to mean “Saturday afternoon,” but Spanish-speakers typically say “Sabado por la tarde.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historians also find “Pasado” to be an odd choice. Had the Ilharreguys chosen “Pasada,” the name would have meant “passage,” but the “o” at the end changed the meaning to “overripe” or “spoiled.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of whether Santa Barbara County officials noticed the Spanish mistranslations, the Board of Supervisors approved and accepted the names of Isla Vista’s streets in November 1925.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three months later, attorneys Alfred W. Robertson and James R. Thompson built three long roads adjacent to the bluffs, two of which joined in a loop on the east side of Isla Vista. They named these streets “Embarcadero Del Mar” and “Embarcadero Del Norte,” meaning “Ocean Wharf” and “North Wharf.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attorneys set aside the inside of the loop for an athletic park, and they extended the four parallel roads built by the Ilharreguys. Most of the streets on the east end of I.V. kept their original names, except Pasado Road, which was renamed “Sevilla” and later became Seville Road.</span></p>\n<p>Robertson and Thompson also named the streets that crossed Embarcadero Del Mar and Embarcadero Del Norte: Cervantes Road, El Greco Road, Picasso Road, Segovia Road, Cordoba Road, Madrid Road and Seville Road. The developers named these streets after prominent Spanish artists and cities, but the streets only existed on paper at the time.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harriet and Brenda Moody, the daughters of building contractor Elmer Moody, developed a tract of land from the Ilharreguy property to Coal Oil Point, submitting a map to the county in April 1926.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite much of the planning that took place in the 1920s between these various landowners, much of Isla Vista looked as though it had never been developed by the early 1940s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historian Jennifer Hildreth Strand noted in her 1987</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">master’s thesis at UC Santa Barbara that Isla Vista was covered with bean fields, a place where “goats wandered” and “roosters crowed.”</span></p>\n<p>The streets that are now Abrego Road and Sueno Road appeared unnamed in a 1944 map of Isla Vista, when a U.S. Marine Corps base was located in place of UCSB.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the establishment of the university, developers began consulting many of the plans laid out by the Ilharreguys, Robertson and Thompson and the Moody sisters in the 1920s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county formed an Assessment District in 1960 to pave and construct much of these roads. By 1968, a map of Isla Vista indicated the newly added Camino Majorca, Fortuna Road, Fortuna Lane and Estero Road. Abrego Road and Sueno Road appeared as named streets on this map.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sueno Road seems to have referred to “dream” in Spanish, but the current spelling omits the “ñ” used in Spanish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cerrato said it does not surprise her at all that historic developers named many of Isla Vista’s streets with little knowledge of the Spanish language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a white community, so this is expected,” Cerrato said.</span></p>\n<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">A

management of community facilities in I.V.’s potential Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s meeting, which took place at the I.V. Clinic Building, was the second to last in a series of meetings the Initiative organized for community members to discuss the framework and specific services that may be offered in the proposed CSD if its formation is approved in the November 2016 county elections. At the meeting, participants explored what services the I.V. Community Center should offer and how the CSD should run other facilities. It was determined community facilities should only be used by public entities or nonprofits for public purposes. The final meeting in the series is scheduled for the same time and place next week and will focus on parking issues.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, community organizer for the office of Assemblymember Das Williams, said she wants the CSD governing board to have some power over the management of community facilities.</p>\n<p>“The power that we are talking about tonight is the ability to acquire, construct, improve, maintain and operate community facilities, including but not limited to community centers, libraries, theaters, cultural facilities and child care facilities,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>According to Elliot, some feel this level of influence is excessive.</p>\n<p>“This was actually one of the powers that kind of freaked people out because of how broad it was,” Elliot said.</p>\n<p>The Board of Supervisors appropriated just under half a million dollars for the renovation of the I.V. Clinic Building, and a grant writer could bring in funding for basic maintenance of the Clinic and other buildings, according to Elliot.</p>\n<p>“The grant writer would be just trying to help supplement the basic maintenance of these buildings, because I am not sure with the limited budget that we have for the CSD that we will be able to execute too many of these programs,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>Elliot said a grant writer, which would cost $50,000 per year, could also work to obtain funding for Community Center services.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67180\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67180\" data-attachment-id=\"67180\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/stakeholders-discuss-usage-of-community-facilities/stakeholders_by-paris-cullen-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452066581\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Paris Cullen-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67180\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“A grant writer would be focused on getting grants to provide services like career advice and mental health services,” Elliot said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said he imagines the Community Center being similar to the A.S.
