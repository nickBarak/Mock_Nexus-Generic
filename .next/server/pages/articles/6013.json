Yeah, that’s a verb in the form of a gerund. So what? I’ll probably use it as a noun later, quite possibly an adverb, but that’s not why we’re here. If you don’t know what YOLO is, then I hope you’re suffering from a serious case of FOMO right now.</p>\n<p>YOLO, as a lifestyle choice, has completely revolutionized every activity in my day. Sometimes I’m at the grocery store and I find myself in the produce aisle jones-ing some yams, when suddenly I begin YOLO-ing. I transform into a state of heightened consciousness where everything becomes awesome. Slow-moving woman on the power chair, you get that bread! A box of cereal, thank you! Cookies, why not? YOLO. Later, as the feelings of YOLO have fully subsided, they hit me again while I’m doing laundry. Spinning clothes: mesmerizing. Homeless man with a surprisingly large wardrobe, how you doing bud? After discovering YOLO, the mundane has become fascinating and all of life’s little chores a bit brighter.</p>\n<p>Quite simply, I’m surprised I made it through my first 21 years without the powers of YOLO. It’s more than a saying and more than a thought; it’s a spirit — a spirit that’s all about gleefulness and just having a blast. But who gave us YOLO you ask? I’ll try to give you a little rundown on what I believe to be the origin and subsequent evolution of YOLO.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The concept has been around as long as humans have, but only recently has the YOLO we know and love come into existence. The Romans gave us carpe diem, but that’s not quite it. The counterculture ’60s put an acidic twist on it, but we weren’t quite there yet. The obvious question is: Who birthed the YOLO revolution? Drake tells us YOLO is the motto but that we already knew the essence of YOLO. How did we know? Did I miss the memo? These are questions that kept me occupied when Drake first told me to YOLO.</p>\n<p>Only recently have I come to fully understand YOLO and it’s pretty much imperative that you do too. I came to UCSB in 2008 (eons ago, I know), and I still like to pretend that Bieber didn’t exist during that golden age. I spent my freshman and sophomore year, like most of us here, in a relative stupor. I lived for the weekends sprinkled with some Tuesdays and Wednesdays. I did the school thing, dabbled in some extracurricular activities, but I never really got engaged in the UCSB community. Frankly, Sundays became a depressing ritual because the only thing I really looked forward to was usually four days away. Don’t get me wrong; going out and getting a little boozed up was incredibly fun most nights, but I felt unfulfilled. Now looking back on it with the infinite wisdom provided to me by YOLO, I know I wasn’t YOLO-ing.</p>\n<p>As a departing senior, spare a moment to heed my advice. UCSB has undoubtedly been the greatest experience of my life and saying that I have regrets would feel a little disingenuous. But if I could run these four years back, there are definitely some things I would do that I missed out on the first time around. I would join a few clubs to meet more people with common interests. I would stress less about school and realize that it’s not the grades we’re here for, but rather the knowledge we’re receiving. Most importantly, I would approach every day with a little more optimism and, finally, I would try to enjoy even the most trivial things. The four years here will fly by faster than you could ever believe. Take every opportunity to challenge yourself, to expand your circle or find a new hobby. If you’re interested in it, UCSB probably has it. Make yourself take that first step. It’s probably the toughest to, but it’s all downhill from there. So if these words aren’t enough, remember: YOLO.</p>\n<p>Jake Schurmeier is fourth-year political science major.</p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

Most of them have been to academic advising at least once this month and are on a first-name basis with their respective undergraduate advisor. These students reveal their innermost fears about choosing a major and what their lives will become as a result.</p>\n<p>But what forces us to constrain our curiosity to only one discipline of choice? Obviously I’m not opting for some hippie-style program where it’s possible to study anything we desire, whether the topics relate at all. Instead, I’m hoping that the objective of higher education shifts back to its original aims. Back in the day (let’s say the ‘70s), tuition at UC schools was a mere $600 per year. The purpose of college is to pursue something that you really enjoy, yet, with budget cuts, tuition hikes and department specialization, it becomes difficult to pursue something you really love (unless, of course, you’re one of those lucky enough to have already discovered your passions). It’s easier than ever to “explore your interests” with Google searches, Facebook pages and blogs, but it’s harder than ever to successfully crash a class and fit non-major courses into your schedule. Why, in contemporary times, do we sacrifice the opportunity for comprehensive knowledge by opting for specialization? Why is the opportunity for interdisciplinary studies so limited? If anything, the borders of disciplines blur now more than ever as a result of growing technology and globalization.</p>\n<p>A surge of independence flows through us when we enter into a higher education institution. The opportunity to make an infinite amount of decisions at our own discretion presents itself daily. A typical student is faced with choices like: “Should I smoke a bowl before class? Should I even go to class? It’s hot, should I go to the beach instead of class?” I’m kidding. UCSB students have a lot more going for them than the predictable stereotypes, which are a likely product of cold-weather students’ envy. With only an average of 20 years and a high school diploma under our belts, most of us have no idea what we want to do for the rest of our lives.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The overwhelming presentation of college doesn’t help either. The worst is the inevitable question of, “So what are you planning on doing with [insert major here]?” The majority of students would love to answer that question with “I have no idea” and be done with it. But, it doesn’t work like that … at all. Think about how nice it would be to major in something you love, and even better, to major in a bunch of things you love.</p>\n<p>The whole point I’m trying to convey is: Pursue what you love. If it’s not offered, then find a way to do it anyway. The interdisciplinary program and independent major program present the rare opportunity to study what interests you, to an extent. Now, I’m not proposing that each of you change to an interdisciplinary major. I am merely highlighting the increase in specialization that has extinguished cross-disciplinary studies within some departments. An education should be well rounded, so choose something from which you’ll actually learn a thing or two and something that will have a positive impact on your life. Our future is important and your major matters in some sense. So next time you or your friends are freaking out about your future, just keep in mind that there are a lot of options out there.</p>\n<p><em>Lindsey O’Hara is a second year undeclared major. </em></p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

Arts workers are twice as likely as other U.S. workers to have college degrees, a trend that may provide some advantage to artists in the U.S. economy, which increasingly requires workers to have at least some college-level education. Artist occupations with some of the highest projected growth rates, according to the study, are museum technicians and conservators (26 percent), curators (23 percent) and multimedia artists and animators (14 percent).</p>\n<p>UCSB recently participated in a national survey of college arts and humanities graduates (SNAAP, the Strategic National Arts Alumni Project), which measures the following:</p>\n<p>• satisfaction with curricular and extracurricular experiences</p>\n<p>• current and past education and employment</p>\n<p>• relevance of arts training to work and further education</p>\n<p>• types of art practiced and how often</p>\n<p>• support and resource needs following graduation</p>\n<p>• experiences as teachers</p>\n<p>• income and support, student debt and other financial issues</p>\n<p>According to SNAAP results, arts graduates experience relatively low rates of unemployment — only 6 percent — and people who work in the arts report some of the highest levels of job satisfaction among all occupations. The study also found that arts graduates gained employment quickly upon graduation, with 83 percent of graduates finding work within the first year of obtaining their degree, while another 12 percent went on to pursue additional higher education.</p>\n<p>Income levels in arts majors are also very competitive: the median annual income in 2010 for UC arts grads was $30,000 immediately upon graduation; $50,000 within 10 years of graduation, with that number steadily increasing as students moved away from their college years and into the mid-point of their careers. Students who had graduated with arts majors in the 1995 cohort reported a median household income of $100,000.</p>\n<p>We hope that by providing this information we can generate some real dialogue about the value of education at UCSB, and encourage you to explore the statistics and testimonies gathered in both the SNAAP survey and by the National Endowment for the Arts — all of which clearly belie the myth of the arts being “useless” at UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>– Ellen Anderson, Director, Isla Vista Arts</p>\n<p>– Professor Paul Berkowitz, Chair, Music Department, UCSB</p>\n<p>– Professor Ann Bermingham, Director, Interdisciplinary Humanities Center</p>\n<p>– Professor Laurie Monahan, Director, Arts Research Initiative, Department of History of Art and Architecture</p>\n<p>– Professor Jane Mulfinger, Chair, Art Department</p>\n<p>– Professor Marko Peljhan, co-Director, University of California Institute for Research in the Arts, Vice Chair Media Arts and Technology</p>\n<p>– Holly Unruh, Associate Director, UC Institute for Research in the Arts</p>\n<p>– Professor Cristina Venegas, Chair, Film and Media Studies</p>\n<p>– Professor Kim Yasuda, co-Director, University of California Institute for Research in the Arts, Department of Art</p>\n<p>– Emily Zinn, Associate Director, Interdisciplinary Humanities Center</p>\n<p>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the Daily Nexus.

Almost all of this legislation is really an attempt to disenfran- chise minorities and students. Wisconsin recently passed a Republican-backed law that prohibits students from voting on campus with their university IDs. Students are now required to present government-issued IDs with a valid address and expiration date. Florida’s new law requires participants in voter registration to register in advance with the state, a debilitating blow to college drives.</p>\n<p>If these measures don’t seem scary, then consider the legislation New Hampshire’s Republicans attempted to push through last year. HB 176 would have prevented stu- dents from voting in their college towns unless they resided there prior to matriculation. Imagine having to drive home for several hours and then back on a Tuesday in order to vote. One of the avid backers of this bill, Republican Assembly Speaker William O’Brien, said in a speech that his reasoning behind supporting such a bill had to do with the fact that students are “foolish,” vote “as a liberal” and “vote their feelings.” This is like saying that if someone does not vote for a Republican, then they are foolish, and therefore they should not vote, without actually saying it. The slew of such anti-student legislation proposals in an election year is only more evidence that the conservatives are scared — scared that young people will vote and that young people will not vote for them.</p>\n<p>I am not telling you whom to vote for.
