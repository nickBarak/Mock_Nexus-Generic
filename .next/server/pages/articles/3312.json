Senate’s statement was posted on the A.S. Senate Facebook page on Nov. 1. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been three allegations of sexual assault brought against Sigma Pi; the first two were reported by the Nexus on </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oct. 24</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while the third was reported by the university through a timely warning sent out on Oct. 28. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura was the one who first brought up the recent allegations to the Senate during the Wednesday night meeting, emphasizing the importance of making survivors of sexual assault aware of the resources available to them through A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate then went into a working group to write a draft of the statement, which was later posted on Facebook alongside a note encouraging attendance of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a town hall hosted by Students Against Sexual Assault on Nov. 14.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement condemns “unsafe spaces” and “any student organization that perpetuates the harassment and abuse of any person”; it also calls for the UCSB administration to respond to “environments that enable sexual violence.” The statement did not name any particular organization or environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its statement, the Senate added that it believes these allegations are not isolated incidents and are instead “a reflection of a greater culture that allows sexual violence to continue.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This harmful culture needs to be addressed and stopped,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Vice President Alli Adam echoed similar points in a statement to the Nexus, stating A.S. “[doesn’t] condone what’s going on in our own community and [has] no problem standing up to fellow community members and confronting this unfortunate culture.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also mentioned that the Senate emphasized the need to demonstrate support rather than simply listing resources for survivors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Something that [the senators] brought up that I thought was really powerful is they didn’t want to just list resources because students kind of feel like that’s redirecting the issue, but [the senators] all were willing to make themselves available as well. So I thought that was a really unique perspective to take, and I’m proud of that,” Adam said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement released by the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) parallels the Senate’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one should have to spend their nights out in fear. It’s on us to take a deep look at the culture that enabled this incident, and correct it,” Board President Spencer Brandt said in the statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kristie Nguyen, board director for the I.V. CSD, the problem doesn’t lie within Greek life as </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some social media posts have </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said, but with the individual.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to see [people] blaming the Greek community for recreating this culture because this culture has already been prevalent throughout society. It’s a huge epidemic,” Nguyen said in a phone call with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you look into it, a lot of people in the Greek community – like fraternities – don’t condone that kind of behavior. It was more of an individual choice to make those disgusting decisions to do that to people. We shouldn’t be blaming anyone but the people who have done what they did.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD’s statement was sent out on Oct. 24 — prior to the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by UCSB to all students on Oct. 28.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said he was “incredibly frustrated and disgusted” by the alleged crime in the timely warning sent out on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that under all the scrutiny that the university is providing [Sigma Pi] right now, there was another incident, really speaks to the institutional problem, a problem with the culture,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement also lists a variety of resources for survivors of sexual assault offered by the I.V. CSD and UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t just stand by without doing something. While we’re already providing services like our interpersonal violence and sexual education and prevention program along with the survivor resource center, we also just want to continue to make it clear what our values are and how we will support survivors,” I.V. CSD Director Ethan Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will believe survivors and we will stand with that.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

attempts per game, both career highs. While possibly aberrational, Crowder displayed decent form and would benefit from a demotion in the offensive rotation.</p>\n<p>Avery Bradley showed a vastly improved offensive game, scoring a career high 15.2 points per contest with an effective field goal percentage of 52 percent, the best efficiency since his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>Bradley continued the Brad Stevens-induced trend of substituting three point jumpers for what had been long-twos, contributing to his uptick in scoring efficiency. The former Longhorn put forth another superior defensive season, which was highlighted in the Celtics’ two clashes with Golden State in which he starred in his audition as the league’s best Steph Curry defender.</p>\n<p>The development of Thomas, Crowder and Bradley asserted them as the above-average NBA starters. Paired with a rim-protector and another shot-creator, Boston has the beginning of an elite starting lineup. The flaws of one dimensional players such as Marcus Smart and Kelly Olynyk don’t look so glaring when they are relegated to bench roles.</p>\n<p>With free agency rolling around again this summer, the true question is: What additions will the Celtics make?</p>\n<p>The free agency market is ripe with players to fill the Celtics’ needs and the suitors will be beyond plentiful. Where Danny Ainge directs his attention in the early days of July will be fascinating. Without further ado, here are a few suggestions as to who Boston could possibly pursue:</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Position: Center </strong></p>\n<p>Flushed with cap space, the Celtics can afford to target the defensive presence at the rim they’ve sorely missed since the departure of Kevin Garnett. While the Raptors’ center has played himself into a max contract in the series against the Cavaliers, he will be worthy of an overpay to take a good defense built on effort and intelligence to an elite level.</p>\n<p>If the Celtics target the block machine, however, they will need to prioritize scoring and ball-handling on the wing as they will receive a little to no contribution from Bismack Biyombo on that end. Biyombo’s hands are bad, but the staff could help him develop a slightly better lob catch, turning him into a decent rim-runner.</p>\n<p>Though there is uncertainty concerning Biyombo’s age (23), he’s shown nothing to suggest his game will suffer a large drop off over the next four years. A team nestled up against the cap with one big move left would be remiss in putting all their eggs in Biyombo’s basket; a team like the Celtics, though, with several rookie scale and bargain veteran contracts extending through the cap boom, should feel comfortable targeting him.</p>\n<p>Ian Mahinmi is another option for the C’s, possibly at a slightly lower price tag as he is Biyombo’s senior by a decent margin at the age of 29, though he offers less mobility on the perimeter and functions more as a point-blank rim protector.</p>\n<p>Neither Hassan Whiteside nor Dwight Howard seem to fit the Celtics’ faster style of play, and too much uncertainty surrounds Festus Ezeli’s health for Ainge to lure him away from Golden State with a substantial offer. Joakim Noah would be a good fit on the floor, adding the best playmaking and defense Brad Stevens has had at the center spot during his coaching tenure.</p>\n<p>Timofey Mozgov and Donatas Motiejunas are possible reclamation projects, too. Mozgov could still flourish as a force in the lane with four shooters around him, and Motiejunas would allow the Celtics to go five-out for the entire game with Olynyk as his backup. Both players might be available on cheaper contracts after disappointing seasons, but with so much cap space around the league they could be bound for expensive deals that aren’t cost-effective for Boston.</p>\n<p>Miles Plumlee is also a viable option and would be a good target if the Celtics find this crop of centers unappealing compared to 2017 or 2018. The latter class has a great deal of star power at the five, including Derrick Favors, DeMarcus Cousins and Brook Lopez.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Position: Wing</strong></p>\n<p>The Celtics will make a pitch for Kevin Durant, but they can’t realistically offer him a better opportunity to win than the Thunder, making plans B, C and D very important.</p>\n<p>Jared Dudley should be a priority for Boston; they can spend heavily on a one or two year deal or get a bargain on a longer contract. Dudley, turning 31 this summer, should have four years of consistent basketball left in him, though injury concerns make a hefty deal doubtful.</p>\n<p>The Boston College alum would be best served coming off the bench as he is able to replace Crowder and also play alongside him in a smaller unit that could easily switch on defense, especially if paired with Marcus Smart at the shooting guard.</p>\n<p>Marvin Williams is appealing for similar reasons, as the four man offers a reliable three point shot and switching ability as a player who has been a small forward at times in his career. In a contract season, Williams was a top 10 power forward in ESPN’s real plus-minus rating, but whether or not that’s replicable is certainly up in the air. He is passing the age 30 threshold in 2016, making a long team deal his priority. However, he is a questionable proposition for a Celtics team looking to maintain future flexibility.</p>\n<p>From the restricted market, Solomon Hill would be a nice addition as a versatile defender, though the Celtics could use someone with more offensive gravity. Moe Harkless is another option, though the Blazers will be likely to match any offer within reason.</p>\n<p>The most impactful possibilities on the wing are Chandler Parsons, who will exercise his player option and become a free agent, and Nicolas Batum. The Mavericks’ small forward would bring juice to the Celtics offense as his silky shot and ball-handling ability would fit seamlessly with Stevens’ five-out aspirations.</p>\n<p>Batum would fit for similar reasons, though he seems committed to staying in Charlotte and carrying the offensive burden he received in his first year as a Hornet, the most substantial of his career.</p>\n<p>Both will hopefully hear from Ainge, as players of their ilk are to be coveted by every NBA team in 2016. Though there are no star players in this class apart from Durant, adding Parsons or Batum would still vault the Celtics meaningfully higher in the East hierarchy.</p>\n<p>With guards a complete non-priority for Boston, they will be free to focus their spending on the frontcourt while hopefully maintaining enough cap space to bring back Amir Johnson and Jonas Jerebko. Both have guarantee dates of July 3, two days after the free agency moratorium begins, giving the Celtics time to strike before deciding their fate.</p>\n<p>Adding Dudley and Biyombo on one- or two-year expensive contracts — allowing them to return to free agency while there’s an obscene amount of cap space available — would be a sound strategy for both sides. If long-term deals are necessary, both should be valuable enough to prove as trade assets during their first years in Boston, allowing the Celtics to welcome any star player made available for trade with open arms.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-17/nba-free-agency-celtics-searching-for-gold/","id":3309,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[3308,3307,3306],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Witnessing The “King” Prevail","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bron-bron.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bron-bron.jpg?resize=750%2C500&ssl=1","description":"Despite facing a 3-1 deficit, LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers managed to fulfill what no other team in NBA history has ever achieved by winning the series 4-3.

While it has not always been this way, the “King” has been under a microscope of the public eye since his freshman year at St. Vincent-St. Mary’s High School in Akron, Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a “Kid from Akron,” it was history we witnessed Sunday night as LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers won the franchise’s first NBA title and became the first team ever to win an NBA Finals series despite trailing 3-1. Most notably, the Cavs’ title victory ended the city of Cleveland’s 52-year championship drought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the forefront of Cleveland’s comeback was the NBA’s best player: LeBron James.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzcUmtu_Hs8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winning his third championship title and Finals MVP, James successfully defended his throne as champion of the underdogs against a team that many considered to the best ever in the Golden State Warriors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When doubted most, the league’s best produced when it mattered, becoming the first player in NBA Finals history to lead all players in total points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals and 2.3 blocks per game in this year’s NBA Finals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, the addition of another ring has ignited the ongoing debate with regard to where James ranks amongst NBA greats Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. While he trails Jordan (6) and Bryant (5) in rings, it’s plausible to believe that James could possibly become a member of the notorious ring-holders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An answer to this debate won’t prevail until James retires. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my book, Jordan reigns supreme as basketball’s greatest of all time. With a player like Bryant who modeled his game after “His Airness” and with James paving his own lane with a form of athleticism and versatility that we had never seen, it’s a debate that will still cause dispute when all is said and done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Sunday night marked the end of his 13th</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NBA season, James’ chance to further etch his name as one of the game’s greatest is optimal as much more basketball lies ahead in his career. Whether that extra time entails more championship rings will be most enticing in helping judge the King’s legacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of how James’ career ends, I’m sure we can all agree that we have never experienced a player with such a universal effect both on and off the court. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the weight of the state of Ohio on his shoulders, James delivered in the most dire time which was reflected with tears at the end of a Game 7 victory; tears of a community, city, state … tears of the witnesses that have waited for so long.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71741\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71741\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-21/witnessing-the-king-prevail/","id":3310,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3309,3308,3307],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"GSA Lounge Renovations to Include Egg Chairs, Access Card Reader","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The GSA applied for funding from the Student Fee Advisory Committee and received $98,000.

The GSA also plans to use part of its own budget to finalize said renovations, with the total cost estimated to slightly exceed $100,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Space really is a commodity on this campus,” Sorin said. “We were hoping… to reclaim [the lounge] publicly as ours, to demonstrate to the broader UCSB community that [it] is for grad students. We really don’t have anywhere else on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other renovations, the GSA intends to replace all the furniture in the lounge and patio, Sorin said, adding that accessibility for all students was considered, as the current furniture limits flexibility within the space. She said the intent with the new furniture is to make every student feel comfortable and welcome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GSA Lounge will be open 24/7, but students will need to check out a keycard from the GSA to open the locked door, according to Sorin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lounge will also be receiving four egg chairs — spherical chairs with an overhead visor — courtesy of UCSB Health and Wellness, which has a budget set aside for graduate students. The chairs will be placed into a new relaxation room, formerly an infrequently used conference room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sorin, the last renovations to the lounge were made prior to Lubach’s appointment as advisor — over 14 years ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The lounge is] a real hodgepodge, we couldn’t tell you where any of it came from,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renovations began in the middle of August and are planned to be completed by the end of fall quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just excited to get it finished… really we just want grad students to feel like they have a place on campus where they are welcome constantly anytime, day or night, and that they can get support, even if that’s just kicking back on the couch,” Sorin said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/gsa-lounge-renovations-to-include-egg-chairs-access-card-reader/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/gsa-lounge-renovations-to-include-egg-chairs-access-card-reader/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/gsa-lounge-renovations-to-include-egg-chairs-access-card-reader/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/gsa-lounge-renovations-to-include-egg-chairs-access-card-reader/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/gsa-lounge-renovations-to-include-egg-chairs-access-card-reader/","id":3311,"author":{"id":52,"name":"Manuel Carlos"},"related":[3310,3309,3308],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
