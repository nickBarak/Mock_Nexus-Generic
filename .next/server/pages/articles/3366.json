The bill will require a two-thirds vote from the student body during the upcoming spring elections to be implemented; if it passes, the seats will be added to the 72nd Senate for the 2021-2022 school year, not the incoming 71st Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally, the bill was written with the intention of replacing one off-campus senator seat with one international student seat to ensure Associated Students (A.S.) Senate remained at an odd number. Keeping the Senate at even numbers would give the internal vice president a significant amount of power if a tie-breaking vote was held, a concern that both Ferguson and Swanson expressed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the bill was amended during the Senate’s Jan. 22 meeting to increase the number of international student senator seats from one to two, instead of removing an off-campus senator seat.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Based off of the statistics I was hearing, I didn’t understand why we were only adding one senator and decreasing representation for other students,” Kimia Hadidi, the off-campus senator who proposed amending the bill, said during the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was amended and passed after a lengthy discussion in which some senators, such as On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman, expressed concern over the potential decrease in off-campus senators. He further discussed how the bill could possibly open the doors to other groups on campus asking for Senate seats designated specifically for them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus after the meeting, Foreman expressed worry that “the Flying A Room can only fit so many people,” and that if more seats were to be added, the Senate should find a way to restructure itself as to ensure that it can still logistically function with a larger governing body.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the Senate is composed of: five on-campus senator seats, 12 off-campus senator seats, six representatives at large, one university-owned housing representative and a transfer student senator.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant amount of support for the bill came from international student groups, such as the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA). According to the UCSB 2018-19 campus profile, 12% of all UCSB undergraduates are international students, and 73% of international students at UCSB are from China. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All UCSB undergraduates, including international students, pay student fees which go toward funding for entities such as A.S. For the 2018-19 school year, UCSB undergraduates each paid </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/cost-of-attendance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1,854</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in these student fees, according to the UCSB Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships; in the same school year, the A.S. Senate received just under </span><a href=\"https://budget.as.ucsb.edu/files/2018/05/budget18-19.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$12.5</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> million in student fees. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Creating an international student senator [seat] can definitely allow us to have a say in how the money is distributed and make sure that our money is used well and fairly,” Hanrui Feng, vice president of the CSSA, said during the meeting.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An international student has never sat on the A.S. Senate at UCSB, but the bill notes that other UCs, such as UC Los Angeles and UC San Diego, have “equivalent” roles for international students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My hope is that this will contribute to expanding crucial opportunities for international students in A.S.,” said Charles Neumann, the internal chair of the A.S. Global Gaucho Commission and one of the bill’s 20 student sponsors. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann added that he considers an international student senator crucial to “breaking down social barriers between international students and domestics, and a path forward in addressing these previously overlooked crucial interests.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-71212\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mural at North Hall that honors the students who protested there for Black rights in 1968. </span><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers, including UCSB students and community organizers, gave speeches on their personal experiences with racism, institutionalized oppression in higher education and the importance of allyship. The procession of approximately 100 then walked to North Hall, stopping at the mural that honors the students who protested there for Black rights in 1968, before ending at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) for lunch.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was hosted by the Martin Luther King Jr. Committee of Santa Barbara, UCSB’s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the MCC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chris Hudley, vice president of the Martin Luther King Jr. Committee, elaborated on the importance of the theme “Remembering The Silence of Our Friends,” which comes from the famous King quote: “We remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During political years, we have forgotten to have conversations,” Hudley explained. “We want the idea of people having conversations, learning and collaborating, to build inclusiveness and equality.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inclusion of friends in conversation was emphasized throughout the event; participants were asked to talk to strangers during the walk about the change they wish to see in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alyssa Frick-Jenkins, president of UCSB’s Black Student Union, discussed the Eternal Flame monument, where the walk begins. The Flame was donated as a gift by the UCSB Class of 1968 to commemorate peace and unity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, the Eternal Flame … commemorates the ongoing legacy of MLK because he lit a similar flame under Black students to take under North Hall and demand equality. I find it important for Black students and those who understand their struggle to not only see the monument as one to MLK’s legacy but also one about taking up space in this institution,” Frick-Jenkins said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frick-Jenkins’ ideas of “self determination, Black freedom and liberation,” which were recurring themes throughout the event, led to a discussion of empowerment in institutions of higher education like UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Take up space here,” Frick-Jenkins told attendees. “We can see ourselves within this institution that was not inherently made for the education of Black people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deandre Miles-Hercules, president of the Black Graduate Students Association, touched on their personal experiences as a Black, gender nonconforming individual and, similarly to Frick-Jenkins, their struggle with taking up space in academia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is important for me personally, because I am Black and gender nonconforming and as a scholar that is not often a comfortable place to be, and in the world that it is often dangerous and harmful to be in,” Miles-Hercules said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MLK said direct action is presenting our very bodies to the conscience of the public of our national and local communities,” they explained. “My presence and showing up authentically is direct action. That too is walking in Dr. King’s legacy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While talking to the crowd, Miles-Hercules also emphasized how their presence at UCSB is statistically unlikely. In the 2017-18 academic year, only 3% of graduate students were Black, whereas 5.8% of California residents were Black, a nearly 3% difference between state and university demographics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Regent Elect and UCSB graduate student Jamaal Muwwakkil, another speaker, reiterated this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not supposed to be here. I’m a poor kid from Compton, California. The statistics are against me … I was not supposed to gain access to the UC. The paradigm for Black students is that diversity lowers standards, that the more Black students you have, the lower the ranking of your school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anne H. Charity-Hudley, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Hall Endowed Chair in the Linguistics of African America</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and linguistics professor, encouraged attendees to discuss with others what made them come out to the event on their walk to North Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miriam Bankons, a participant who has been coming to the event for five years, was eager to share her answer to Charity-Hudley’s question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m here in memory of all the people that came before me and walking for them,” she said. “Talking to other people that we don’t know, that we don’t see, is a way to honor King. His holiday is about a day of service, and I believe this is a way of service.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the march reached North Hall, Charity-Hudley recounted the racism she has experienced while achieving success in academia, including being targeted by police and having drawings of lynchings painted on her wall after receiving a raise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In many positions, people are happy to see Black people on campus until they receive raises, labs and support. There’s a level of tension when we don’t stay in our place … I want you to think about how we can continue to rise until you make somebody else nervous with your level of success.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participants then walked to the MCC to enjoy lunch, celebrate successes made in the name of Black empowerment and listen to MLK’s most famous speeches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many attendees discussed how Miles-Hercules’s words resonated with them, especially their ending comments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Be a brother, a sister, be a partner in crime to equity and justice, and show up when things are hard and let go of some of that privilege that you might bear in the service of equity and justice,” Miles-Hercules said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That is how we walk in Dr. King’s footsteps and honor his memory.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

legitimate chapter of the national Rock the Vote organization. <em>Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no public questioning of the group’s practices until</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SBStudentActivistNetwork/posts/rock-the-vote-sb-has-been-caughtrock-the-vote-sb-has-been-masquerading-for-month/1810602312406454/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a Facebook post </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">published on Jan. 11 by the Student Activist Network alleged that Rock the Vote SB was not a legitimate chapter of the national Rock the Vote organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rock the Vote SB stole the logo of a nonprofit that has national recognition for being a nonpartisan, get-out-the-vote effort. They then set up a nonprofit and used that branding of that trusted nonprofit, basically as a way to say that their organization is objective and is to be trusted,” said Ry Brennan, a member of the Student Activist Network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> representative from the national Rock the Vote organization confirmed that Rock the Vote SB was formed in August 2019 as a part of the larger organization, but as of now is “not a legitimate chapter.” They also said that the national organization sent Rock the Vote SB a cease-and-desist letter in December.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former Rock the Vote SB Executive Director Robin Howe explained in a statement that Rock the Vote SB was a compliant chapter with the national organization beginning in August 2019. In November, he was told that Rock the Vote DC “received complaints” regarding the Rock the Vote SB operation. Rock the Vote SB initially “wholeheartedly attempted to work with them to bring our operation into compliance,” he said, but was asked by the national organization in December to “drop our affiliation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock the Vote SB then “immediately ceased operation[s],” Howe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe added that the Student Activist Network’s allegations –– which included that Rock the Vote SB suppressed the vote in I.V. by encouraging online voter registration, telling people their car insurance would go up if they voted in Isla Vista and that the group encouraged people to vote at home instead of in I.V. ––  were “misleading and unverified.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations of voter suppression not only relate to Rock the Vote but also alleged ties to Bruce Porter, a candidate running for the third district seat in the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors March election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe said that in August 2019, he responded to a post on the Rock the Vote SB website that stated the group was hiring. He then was “introduced to and met briefly with Bruce Porter,” who “mentioned his intention was to create a non-partisan voter registration group in Isla Vista.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a letter Porter sent to his supporters on Jan. 15, which was obtained by the Nexus, Porter discussed Rock the Vote’s alleged intent to cause low voter turnout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Congressman Salud] Carbajal and [Supervisor Joann] Hartmann went all out to crush the nonpartisan voter registration effort in Isla Vista and shotgun accusations of voter suppression,” Porter wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, Rock the Vote has done a fabulous job of providing truthful and objective voter registration education to students. The result: far more students chose to register back home and there are 1400 fewer students registered to vote in IV this year, compared to this point in 2016, even though the student population has significantly increased.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe told his staff in an email sent on Jan. 15 that operations were “on hold for the moment” due to “local political issues.” Howe told them in the email to refrain from wearing their T-shirts and doing any branding and to delete all social media accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers were left without a clear reason why all operations had ended out of nowhere as Howe instructed staff to tell current and potential volunteers “the schedule is full and no more volunteers are needed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple Rock the Vote SB volunteers spoke to the Nexus, saying they had no idea that the organization was illegitimate until this week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw a post on Free and For Sale that was basically just trashing Rock the Vote for all these allegations,” said Sean Price, a first-year pre-biology major. “At first I didn’t believe it, but then I found out that the website was gone, Facebook was gone; I haven’t checked their Instagram, but I’m sure that’s gone too. I didn’t hear anything from them when this all happened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second-year volunteer, who asked not to be named, said that they tried to reach out about changing their shift day for winter quarter and never heard back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I did get was an email about there’s been stuff going on this week with tabling. So I had no idea basically what was going on until I read an article on Facebook about that it could potentially be a fraudulent organization … they stopped tabling, and then just nothing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Student Activist Network raised three separate allegations against Rock the Vote SB accusing them of voter suppression in Isla Vista. The group alleges that Rock the Vote gave out voter registration cards at the Arbor instead of filling out physical forms, that they told people their car insurance costs would increase if they registered to vote in I.V. and that they encouraged people to vote at their home addresses in other parts of the state instead of in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers who spoke to the Nexus confirmed that official registration forms were “rarely” provided for tabling in favor of voter registration cards that directed people to the Rock the Vote SB website, which has since been shut down, to register to vote on their own time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the eyes of the Student Activist Network, handing out cards makes it less likely for students to register to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have tabled many times at the Arbor and I know that students are often walking by very, very quickly. They often take things that are handed to them and then immediately throw them away,” Brennan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best way to actually get somebody signed up to vote is to actually ask them to come over to your table and fill out the form. That is the only way that you could actually guarantee that the people who you have actually gotten to bring over to your booth are actually going to follow through … We only complicate the process when we ask people to go online to fill out forms.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe said in a statement that Rock the Vote SB encouraged online registration but “ALWAYS carried hardcopies of voter registration cards for those who preferred that method which we found to be rare because Gen Z generally is a digital culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One second-year volunteer, who requested their name not be used, said they were confused about why voter registration forms were not the norm but didn’t deeply question the practice because they believed Rock the Vote SB to be a legitimate organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel really frustrated because in retrospect looking back, things were sort of red flags,” they said. They added that they were made familiar with the organization through a UCSB honors mail listserv. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just never assumed that through an honors mail listserv that an actual, illegitimate thing could be presented to us students,” they said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another allegation raised by the Student Activist Network was that Rock the Vote SB told students that their car insurance rates would go up if they registered to vote in I.V., which they heard from multiple students who Rock the Vote SB volunteers had spoken with, but Howe rejected that claim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have never heard of the concept of car insurance rates getting raised nor did anything remotely close to that ever get discussed with my team,” Howe said in the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This claim is the most bizarre of them all. It is so obviously unbelievable it waves a red </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flag as to how low the people spreading these dishonest statements will go for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their own political gain.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No volunteers that the Nexus spoke with had ever heard of discussions about car insurance rates increasing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final issue raised by the Student Activist Network is that Rock the Vote SB suppressed the vote by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“dissuading people from registering in IV on the grounds that other elections in the Bay, LA, and San Diego are more contested,” according to its Facebook post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the backside of the Rock the Vote SB online voting card obtained by the Nexus, the card reads that “It’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Choice Where to Register,” whether that be at home or school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The card’s wording did not raise alarms for Price until this past week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are three places on the card: Los Angeles, San Diego and Bay Area issues, but nothing in Santa Barbara, like no reason to vote in Santa Barbara, and then there’s websites to each place about those issues,” Price said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It basically just said vote where you think your opinion matters more, like where you’ll make a difference, which is basically what I told people and what I thought was being advertised by them, but now I’ve heard that it’s not.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no further information from Howe or Rock the Vote SB in general, student volunteers for Rock the Vote SB have been left confused about where the organization stands and remain frustrated by new information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything looked very legit and no interactions that I had with anyone were bad. They were all just pretty straightforward. I was just to get my volunteer hours, so that’s really frustrating for someone who was trying to have volunteers actually make a difference and register people to vote and that’s important to me,” one volunteer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t help beating myself up, like why didn’t I, like, think this was a bigger issue at the time?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, I’m waiting for more information to come to light because I feel very taken advantage of,” Price said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I figured I was doing something to help voter registration and improve community involvement. And if that’s the opposite of what was happening, then that’s the exact opposite of why I joined this.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Tower to the Arbor. <em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students are informally calling for a similar cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), although advocacy group UCSB 4 COLA stressed that Wednesday’s action was just the first step in a larger COLA movement and not a formal strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students at UCSC have been on strike since Dec. 9, 2019 and have been calling for a COLA of $1,412 per month </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/campaign-timeline/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since September</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The “sick-out” on Wednesday was planned to coincide with a UC Regents meeting, in which the UCSC strikers planned to address the UC Office of the President directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Wednesday demonstration focused on the parallels between the challenges faced by UCSB and UCSC graduate students, such as steep housing costs, and the high number of students at both schools who are considered “rent-burdened,” meaning that they pay more than 30% of their income toward rent. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the UCSB Graduate Student Association took an informal poll of roughly 600 graduate students and found that respondents, on average, spent 48% of their $2,091.98 monthly income on rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers said that the “sick-out” was meant to draw attention to the COLA movement and gather support from graduate and undergraduate students who may not be aware of the movement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s people [here] from [the Graduate Student Association] …  but this is really a separate movement that grad students have started,” said Emily, one of the organizers of Wednesday’s event who declined to give her last name. She explained that the group was mostly composed of union members from UAW 2865.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Similar to Santa Cruz, this is grad students coming up, standing up and saying, ‘What we’re dealing with now is unacceptable,’ and so we’re really following their lead on that,” Emily added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to calling in sick on Wednesday, close to 150 graduate students and supporters marched from Storke Tower to the Arbor, chanting, “C-O-L-A, we need fair pay!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once in the Arbor, several graduate students spoke to the crowd and to students who stopped to watch the demonstration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of you may be wondering why grad students are rallying today … it’s because of the immense hardships that we’re facing. We can choose to keep our heads down and go on with business as usual. Or we can speak up about these hardships,” Rammy Salem, a graduate student in the psychological and brain sciences department, said to the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of us are homeless. Some of us skip meals. Some of us have to work multiple jobs and still work paycheck-to-paycheck,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of us think the cost of living is way too expensive — that ain’t right. So if you agree that grad students deserve to live dignified lives, support the movement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers called for the support of undergraduate students, staff and faculty as well, stressing that “it’s not just grad students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pratik Raghu, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Global Studies, said to the crowd that he was at the demonstration because he knew he was just “one serious medical accident away from potentially losing [his] apartment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all out here because we know that we are past the point of asking nicely. Asking nicely doesn’t do shit,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So let’s be a little less nice to the university — in fact, let’s be a lot less nice in making these demands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raghu said in an interview afterwards that he was “nothing more than a participant” in the demonstration, although he felt compelled to speak to the crowd in the Arbor because he is an international student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would hope that we can continue to show strength in numbers as we did on this particular occasion, and I hope that we can come up with a collective program of action that can help us maintain that strength in numbers,” Raghu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other international graduate students spoke to the Nexus about the restrictions they face due to their visas and how that can impact their ability to support themselves throughout the year. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jordan Tudisco — an international graduate student in the comparative literature department — said that international students in particular are struggling because their visas do not allow them to work for any employer other than the university, excluding a select few </span><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international student work programs. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If UCSB decides not to employ me over the summer, I cannot work somewhere else,” they said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Kagan-Moore, a graduate student in the Department of History of Art and Architecture, said that graduate students as a whole struggle over the summer when there are fewer teaching appointments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve had a couple of health issues that essentially bankrupted me this summer,” Kagan-Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because we make so little as instructors of record and as TAs, that has had an extraordinarily deleterious effect on my ability to do my own research and my ability to serve my students. It is a holistic problem and the amount of labor that we render to this institution should be compensated,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Wednesday’s demonstration, organizers said they plan to regroup to begin drafting demands. Emily added that the demonstration was designed to involve more people in the discussions so the meetings are “as representative as possible of the grad student population.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were chatting, we were creating community, because [this demonstration] is a thing of creating community among graduate students,” said Azucena Trincado</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a graduate student in the Spanish and Portuguese department. “In graduate school, you feel kind of isolated or separated in departments.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think, for [the university], it’s good to maintain us divided, and we are showing that we can unite,” Trincado said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [1/23/2020 10:19 a.m.]: A previous version of this article said that speaker Rammy Salem said “<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us think the cost of learning is way too expensive.” The article has been corrected to reflect that he said “Most of us think the cost of living is way too expensive.” </span></em></p>\n<p><em>Correction [1/23/2020 5:27 p.m.]: A previous version of this article referred to Tudisco with the wrong pronouns.
