Improvability, UCSB’s improv troupe, will be hosting a Greek-life-themed comedy show this Friday in Embarcadero Hall from 8-11 p.m. Tickets are $3 at the door, and organizers urge students to arrive at 7:45 p.m. to secure their seats. Improvability regularly hosts shows every Friday.</p>\n<p><strong>TO SPEAK FOR THE TREES</strong><br>\nYour Children’s Trees will be planting and maintaining a coastal oak forest at CCBER North Campus Open Space from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday. Organizers advise that interested volunteers bring water and sun protection and wear close-toed shoes and long pants that they don’t mind getting dirty. Biking to the reserve is also recommended. Your Children’s Trees is a student-run environmental organization that hopes to improve coastal runoff and the environment of Santa Barbara by planting trees to create a healthier ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>LITuation</strong><br>\nThe long-awaited Deltopia is upon us, and the LITuation Boyz are kicking it off with a dayger on Saturday from 2-6 p.m. DJs Choppa, P. Diggy and J. Prince will be playing all day, along with currently undisclosed guests. Food will also be sold; guests can purchase chicken or beef tacos for $1.50 each. The party is at 6588 Madrid Rd, and entry is $5 for uninvited guests if ordered in advance or $7 at the door. Wristbands can be picked up at 8 p.m. Thursday at Gio’s.</p>\n<p><strong>TAKE BACK DELTOPIA</strong><br>\nFor those looking to avoid the crowds this weekend, Take Back the Night will be hosting a Deltopia safe space at Pardall Center on Friday from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. and Saturday from 1-6 p.m. April is Sexual Assault awareness month, and everyone is encouraged to go and enjoy a safe and relaxing environment.</p>\n<p><strong>TAKING OUT THE TRASH</strong><br>\nFor those concerned about the environmental impacts of Deltopia, you should be. According to the Coastal Fund, after last year’s Deltopia, 3,247 pounds of trash were picked up off the streets of I.V. This Sunday, Adopt-A-Block and the Coastal Fund will be teaming up to clean up after Deltopia, with the goal of preventing trash from reaching the ocean. The event runs from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at 961 Embarcadero del Mar. Free food and beverages will be provided, and volunteers will be entered into a raffle with prizes from local businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>MEATLESS SUNDAY</strong><br>\nA local group called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Café). Food Not Bombs is a large organization that spans the country and is a form of “franchise activism.” They believe that corporate and government priorities are skewed and allow hunger despite the abundance of food and food waste. Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76692\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/vista-point-weekly-freebies-and-activities-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76692\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/vista-point-weekly-freebies-and-activities-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/vista-point-weekly-freebies-and-activities-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/vista-point-weekly-freebies-and-activities-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/vista-point-weekly-freebies-and-activities-in-i-v/","id":4446,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4445,4444,4443],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report","biography":"Not available","articles":[1981,1982,2072,2234,2284,2351,2370,2417,2437,2512,2534,2614,2711,2733,2738,2754,2801,2827,2835,2940,2984,2992,3004,3036,3044,3090,3438,3439,3444,3450,3453,3465,3470,3471,3520,3581,3628,3655,3679,3698,3764,3776,3789,3791,3792,3794,3797,3800,3907,3958,3970,4043,4061,4134,4135,4169,4189,4190,4196,4197,4199,4213,4215,4216,4230,4232,4236,4244,4249,4250,4253,4262,4271,4277,4279,4281,4293,4294,4296,4309,4314,4315,4325,4328,4330,4343,4345,4346,4354,4364,4373,4374,4400,4405,4411,4412,4424,4425,4427,4429,4439,4446,4460,4461,4463,4468,4485,4486,4580,4635,4638,4640,4644,4702,4707,4728,4761,4777,4814,8046],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Report Shows Stability in I.V.

Despite the increase from the last year, Chuck Flacks, executive director of C3H, said the homeless population has remained “remarkably stable” in recent years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said because Isla Vista has “a very small sample” of people who are homeless, the 37 percent increase only reflects “one or two” more people coming in to I.V. since 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did see a small increase, but it wasn’t a huge increase, and the reality is that things have remained fairly stable,” Flacks said. “Population stays consistent as a result of homeless outreach and housing for the homeless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks said the “consistent” numbers are likely a result of homeless outreach organizations in Isla Vista such as the Pescadero Lofts, a complex that opened in 2014 to help keep homeless community members off the streets. The complex currently houses 35 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Flacks, the Pescadero Lofts are “proof” that through community outreach, counties can reduce the amount of people who are homeless living in an area. The Pescadero Lofts offer counseling for people as well as an alcohol and drug program.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The C3H report also showed that 33 percent of unsheltered people have health insurance, which Flack attributed to the Affordable Care Act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Under the Affordable Care Act, we saw a huge expansion of people who are homeless getting access to Medi-Cal,” Flacks said. “Typically, we encourage them to go to primary health providers who accept Medi-Cal, and we’ve had a lot of success, seeing fewer people dying on the streets as a result of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks said, however, that many people who are homeless are worried about how lawmakers at the  federal government are  proposing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Flacks, Isla Vista is one of the “poorest communities in the county” and said the results of the homeless census do not account for the countless people who are “unstably housed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the need for affordable housing is “critical” when there are residents couchsurfing or living in doubled and tripled rooms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The census] is a baseline of the total homeless and potentially homeless population in I.V.,” he said. “The biggest problem — and that’s a countywide concern — is access to affordable housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks emphasized that aiding homeless community members can only reduce the homeless population. He said people who are homeless are reminders that “our system is not working” in regard to mental health and alcohol and drug treatment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Homeless people are like the canary in the coal mine for our society, and they’re a visible reminder of neglect,” Flacks said. “So when we have more people on the street, it means we’re doing something wrong.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/report-shows-stability-in-i-v-homeless-population-since-2013/","id":4443,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[4442,4441,4440],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The bluff-side seats provided a panoramic view of the contestants in the water.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First place went to James Burns, fourth-year financial mathematics and statistics major, because he was able to “get his feet on the nose of his board in every heat,” according to Benny Drescher, head organizer of the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Like in any surf contest, James won because he picked the right board for the day – a longboard, that is – and caught the best waves in each heat,” Drescher said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four judges scored the performances of each surfer. With each new round, the judges would drop the lowest-scoring surfers from the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They judge you on style, like if you fall or do something really well,” said Axel Eaton, fourth-year environmental studies major and competition contestant. “It’s subjective, but it’s the nature of the sport.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teams representing Greek houses joined in the competition, and each house donated a sum of money as part of their philanthropy efforts. Organizers also accepted donations from non-surfers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The competition raised $230 from contestant entry fees and general donations. Individual entries were $8 per person and $35 for teams of five. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proceeds from the contest will go toward the I.V. Surfrider’s campaign to distribute reusable party cups made entirely of recycled plastic. Some of the donations will also be sent to the Rainforest Action Network to benefit their Climate Action Fund.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want to do with our campaign is minimize the waste of red solo cups by replacing them with the reusable ones,” judge Marcus Vicari and current I.V. Surfrider president said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers hope to get a bulk order of the cups to distribute to the contestants who can then document how much they have used the cups, Vicari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefit competition is partly in response to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the middle of the Pacific Ocean that contains millions of pieces of polluting plastic, he said. The initiative stems from their “Rise Above Plastics” campaign that strives to help bring an end to single-use plastics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Surfrider foundation was founded on the thought to keep oceans clean and open to the public,” judge Zach Georgii of the San Luis Obispo Surfriders chapter said. “No person should be able to own a part of the ocean, and nobody should be polluting our waters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are also trying to get local restaurants in I.V. and Goleta to stop using single-use plastics in their “ocean friendly restaurants campaign.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. Surfrider chapter also hosts beach clean-up days throughout the year in its efforts to keep local waters clean. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Anthony Lai / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Following a storm last week that quickened the erosion of Isla Vista’s bluffs, the county ordered three residents to evacuate their ocean side bedrooms on the upper and lower units of 6757 Del Playa Drive. All 20 residents of the building decided to leave in search of new housing.</p>\n<p>Olivia Haney, a third-year chemistry major who resided at 6757 Del Playa Drive, said students from the upstairs unit are moving into university housing at San Clemente Villages and Sierra Madre Villages. Other downstairs residents like herself have relocated to housing along Trigo Road, and the rest remain in the building until they can find a new place to live.</p>\n<p>“It’s sad we had to break up the house, because we all became very close, but I’m happy with the decision,” Haney said. “I wanted to be safe rather than sorry, so I’m happy I am still able to be with my friends even if it’s not in ’57.”</p>\n<p>A month before the order to vacate two ocean side bedrooms on 6757 Del Playa Drive, a cliffside balcony collapse on 6653 Del Playa Drive forced 28 students to find new housing.</p>\n<p>Nina Karr, a third-year biology major, said tenants from 6653 have moved to housing at Sueno Road, Trigo Road and downtown Santa Barbara. She currently resides on Sueno and said Del Playa was a good street to live on because it is well lit and filled with people.</p>\n<p>“The further you go away from DP, it gets a little sketchier, not that I feel unsafe, but I definitely felt a little safer on DP,” Karr said. “But Sueno is definitely nice; our apartment’s really nice. I would say the only problem is that it’s not in Goleta.”</p>\n<p>According to Debbie Fleming, the assistant vice chancellor for student affairs, there was a coordinated effort between the Associated Students Pardall Center, Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), Community Housing Office, Housing &amp; Residential Services, A.S. Legal Services, the Dean of Students Office and property manager Wolfe &amp; Associates to provide assistance to the displaced UCSB students of 6757 Del Playa Drive. Santa Barbara City College was also able to support its students.</p>\n<p>“Because we had the experience of going through this before, we were better prepared to quickly respond and organize a group meeting to offer assistance,” Fleming said in an email, referring to the balcony collapse in January.</p>\n<p>Following the balcony collapse, IVTU has been working with departments across the university and county to establish a protocol for a clear line of communication between the students and these entities. According to Diana Puente, the A.S. Isla Vista community advisor, it can be challenging for the university to provide support for students because many of the properties in Isla Vista are private, so the flow of communication is not yet established.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76136\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76136\" data-attachment-id=\"76136\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/students-search-for-housing-after-dp-evacuations/clifffall_v2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?fit=1868%2C1129&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1868,1129\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CliffFall_V2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?fit=250%2C151&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?fit=888%2C537&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-76136\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2-1024x619.jpg?resize=888%2C537\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"537\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?resize=1024%2C619&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?resize=250%2C151&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?resize=768%2C464&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?w=1868&amp;ssl=1 1868w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CliffFall_V2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76136\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Soham Tikekar / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“We just kind of saw a really significant need,” Puente said. “So that would mean, once there is information that comes out about an event that has happened in Isla Vista, to be able to gather all the folks together to be able to determine what different services each group can provide.”</p>\n<p>IVTU chair Daniel Renteria added that part of the board’s decision was to collaborate with different organizations and create a community fund for non-UCSB students in a housing crisis.</p>\n<p>“Because of our student fees, our money couldn’t go to these three non-UCSB students that were affected,” Renteria said. “So I think in light of this, it just came out about what more can we do for the community.”</p>\n<p>Karen Kurpershoek, student coordinator at A.S. Food Bank, said IVTU partnered with her organization to provide food packages for affected students. They also helped refer the displaced students to academic advising, housing, financial aid and emergency loans.</p>\n<p>“So, if something does happen with the storm or housing or whatever it may be, if someone needs to reach out and get immediate assistance, we can provide that for them,” Kurpershoek said.</p>\n<p>Some of the displaced students who have secured housing now see Del Playa Drive in a different light.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely scary,” Karr said. “The rain, especially today [Feb. 17] was insane, and I’ve been thinking to myself, like ,I’m happy I’m not living there anymore because this potentially could cause a lot more damage, so I’m kind of grateful we got out of that situation.”</p>\n<p>Emma Holtzapple, a fourth-year environmental studies major who was able to stay in her part of the building on 6653 Del Playa Drive, said it was strange to no longer have the portion of the balcony even if she knows the cliff is officially stable.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people look forward to living oceanside DP their senior year and having that balcony to enjoy and even the safety that comes along with that,” Holtzapple said. “That was all taken away from us.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76131\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/students-search-for-housing-after-dp-evacuations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76131\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/students-search-for-housing-after-dp-evacuations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/students-search-for-housing-after-dp-evacuations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/students-search-for-housing-after-dp-evacuations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/students-search-for-housing-after-dp-evacuations/","id":4445,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[4444,4443,4442],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
