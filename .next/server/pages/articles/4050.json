Besides the noon rally, the fifth floor occupation remained relatively uneventful, with organizers even setting up a projector to watch “The Matrix” later in the evening.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several undergraduates who attended sections at Cheadle Hall said that they were in support of the COLA movement and their TAs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The TAs are being exploited right now. There’s definitely some unfair practices happening around the fact that the UC Regents refuse to discuss it; it’s pretty disappointing,” said Kate Ripley, a first-year psychological and brain sciences major who was there to attend her Feminist Studies 30 section.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In college, I’ve noticed in all of my classes that I don’t get nearly as much instruction from professors as I do from the TAs. The TAs are there to talk to you personally. The TAs are always there for you,” said Jamie Donofrio, a second-year computer science major. “They need to live, and that’s kind of a thing where if a person needs to live, we need to be there to support them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Ripley’s perspective, the themes of Feminist Studies 30, which including unfair labor practices and exploitation, are relatable to COLA movements across the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just find it very disappointing that in this situation, the graduate students have been kind of villainized and made to seem that they’re asking for too much or asking for more than others, when they’re just asking for enough to survive,” Ripley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially with the police force that was used at Santa Cruz, it is just really disappointing. As someone who is paying tuition, I know my tuition is going towards police brutality, and that is really frustrating.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both at the noon rally and throughout the day at Cheadle Hall, COLA organizers emphasized the importance of undergraduate support, encouraging them to attend COLA meetings and bring their friends. On Tuesday, COLA organizers created an </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwc6XltN-1Yp6LEfO1GdZX7SDKnhgC583DhcQ4_YA_PplfRQ/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">undergraduate petition of support</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which has already received hundreds of signatures in the past three days, according to Emily, a graduate student involved in COLA organizing who preferred not to give her last name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email to the Nexus, Yang noted that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate Dean Carol Genetti and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn invited COLA organizers and the executive leadership of the UCSB GSA to a meeting on Tuesday to discuss “the concerns of graduate students broadly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our campus has long had a culture of working collaboratively with our students to address concerns and provide support. We recognize the challenges and pressures that our graduate students face, especially those related to housing,” he wrote.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email sent to the GSA and COLA organizers emphasized that administrators could not “discuss the ASE contract specifically,” referencing the graduate students’ union contract with UAW 2865, which represents graduate students across the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GSA President Cierra Sorin said that as of Friday at midnight, COLA organizers “haven’t formally responded” to the administration’s request yet, but that COLA organizers plan to take the Tuesday meeting with the administration and “see where we go from there.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93040\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/cola_ida-kazerani_online_9/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-93040\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93040\" data-attachment-id=\"93040\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/cola_ida-kazerani_online_9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COLA_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"COLA_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE_9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COLA_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COLA_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93040\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COLA_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COLA_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COLA_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COLA_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COLA_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COLA_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COLA_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_9.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93040\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-napolitano-s-statement-her-invitation-meet-graduate-and-professional-council\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out shortly after 4 p.m. on Friday, Napolitano said she had invited the UC Graduate and Professional Council (UCGPC) to discuss “issues of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">importance and impact to graduate students,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">including cost of living, housing, mental health, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">training and mentoring, career placement, and childcare.”</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin, however, said she doubted that COLA would be seriously addressed in this meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frankly, the fact that Napolitano hasn’t chimed in on things until now, until the same day that folks received warning letters of termination, I don’t think that’s an accident. I think UC bureaucracy is trying to keep this limited to a single campus because then they think they can quell the movement,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that, from her perspective, the representatives of UCGPC are “anti-COLA” and don’t represent the feelings of UC graduate students as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I guess my question at the end of the day would be why would she talk to COLA if she doesn’t want to legitimize the movement,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC’s GSA sent an email to Napolitano, the UCSC administration and UCSC graduate students in response to Napolitano’s statement, noting that “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCGPC has nothing to do with the COLA campaign [and] has refused contact since its inception.” They added that there is no UCSC representation on that council. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kavitha Iyengar, the president of UAW Local 2865, issued a statement earlier this morning echoing Sorin’s concerns about Napolitano’s invitation to UCGPC, saying the council did not “have legal authority to bargain on the workers’ behalf.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Conflating COLA negotiations with UCGPC’s other advocacy efforts is an attempt to buy time and deflate the energy of this movement — and it will not work,” Iyengar wrote, adding that UAW Local 2865 had </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQnj7hw2866SMHQiNM_NH1TWZQPm-cfG4CzlyohAl6s/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formally asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the UC to bargain with the union for a COLA in Janaury. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB 4 COLA plans to hold a General Assembly meeting on Monday at 6 p.m. in the MultiCultural Center, where they intend to discuss their actions moving forward and prepare for the Tuesday meeting with administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think in part some of that is going to be determined by what is happening at Santa Cruz come Monday morning,” Sorin said. “If folks are receiving termination letters, that may escalate things here faster, it may not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a collective movement and we are really doing our best to ensure that we are not making decisions without as many voices as possible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Sorin said she was “floored” by the response on Friday, particularly from undergraduates and faculty, and hopes to continue building a UCSB coalition moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been here for five years.

Courtesy of Katherine Price</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going away for college meant spending Ramadan away from home, but Muslim students made it a priority to foster their own sense of community in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, amidst the coronavirus pandemic, these students have been scattered back to their hometowns, some celebrating with their families for the first time in years, while others have stayed in Isla Vista, spending the month markedly more alone than usual.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salman Sadak, a third-year biology major and vice president of the Muslim Student Association (MSA), spent Ramadan in his hometown — his first Ramadan at home since coming to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s very nostalgic in that it gives me a feeling of the Ramadans of my childhood, like breaking the fast with my parents and family and waking up at 4 a.m. helping my mom cook,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadak said that many members of the MSA talked about how much they miss having Ramadan on campus because of how it brings them closer together. Despite the pandemic, the MSA has still been holding its weekly general meetings on Zoom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It isn’t just like a one-day event, it’s like an entire month, and you see these people every single day kind of out of necessity because you gotta eat.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At night, when they would have normally gone to the mosque for what Sadak describes as both a social and spiritual experience, they instead view a live telecast that the mosque provides.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m still getting that spiritual connection, and even though we’re all separate, we can still livestream the prayer, pray with the imam, still get that ritual in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being able to gather in-person is one of the cornerstones of celebrating Ramadan, and despite celebrating at home, physical distancing requirements have made this Ramadan different from many students’ childhood celebrations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huda Faiz, a third-year biology major and former MSA president, is currently at home, and said the connections with others were missing this year compared to normal years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Usually we go to the mosque at night for prayers and whatnot, and it’s kind of nice to connect with community and see all your family, friends and everyone in one place, but that’s kind of missing,” Faiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make up for it, Faiz said that some people have even decorated corners of their homes to resemble a mosque. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said she usually travelled back home for Eid al-Fitr to attend a celebration with her family at the Muslim Community Association, a large mosque and community center in Santa Clara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll all dress up and we’ll go do our prayers there,” Faiz said, adding that most of her relatives live in Santa Clara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll meet all of them and take part in the festivities,” she said. “Now, there’s nothing going on … visiting people is really big in Eid and you go and you visit all your family friends, so that’s definitely missing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tala Alawwad, a second-year biochemistry major, spent Ramadan in Isla Vista. For the most part, she would break fast alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes I did eat with friends, just as dinner for them but breaking my fast for me, and that was fine,” Alawwad said. “Home for me is in Abu Dhabi … [my family is] just home and together, and that’s usually how it is … and at least they have each other to be spiritual and engage with the traditions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Price, a first-year linguistics major and the secretary of the MSA, would have been celebrating her first Ramadan with other Muslim UCSB students this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were going to have all of these iftars, all of these dinners set up like four out of the five days of the week; we would have restaurants coming in and catering all of this really good food,” Price said. “It was going to be really exciting.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as the pandemic began to shut down campus, Price said she had to start calling and cancelling all the orders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said the iftars would often draw close to 100 people, with not just undergraduate students in attendance but staff, faculty and graduate students as well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was super festive, super fun … and we really missed out on a lot of that,” Faiz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the MSA has held interfaith iftars on campus, inviting other religious organizations to break fast with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Iftar is not just something for the Muslim community to take advantage of, but we also use it as a moment to get to know our fellow UCSB community and Isla Vista community, so it kind of makes me sad that we don’t really get that opportunity this year, but hopefully next year,” Sadak said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift to online classes also provided some Muslim students with more flexibility, as balancing their fasting with a full day of being on campus was often draining. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In past years, Sadak had trouble during evening classes and labs which did not allow students to eat, therefore preventing him from breaking fast during class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With online classes, it’s been more chill,” Sadak said. “Just being at home … it’s just been a lot more manageable, and I feel like professors are already really understanding about the whole COVID situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had an exam at a certain time right when I would have to break my fast, and I talked to my professor about it and he was understanding because, you know, it’s like everyone’s already dealing with so much.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz added that walking around campus all day usually left her in a “fasting fog,” in which she was more fatigued and was not able to concentrate on anything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With classes being recorded, now that they’re online, I can kind of shift my whole sleep schedule and rest a little bit during the day and watch more of the class videos at night,” Faiz said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Alawwad felt that online classes were actually more draining than in-person classes during Ramadan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last year, I would try to occupy myself, go to classes, see people, kill time … you’re not thinking about the hunger as much as you are sitting at home,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Faiz, being at home and indoors most of the day has made breaking fast easier compared to being at school, especially since she breaks fast with her family, a built-in community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s friends, I feel like we’d all have different schedules and sometimes it’s hard to find a time that matches for all of us to get together,” Faiz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being stuck at home, Faiz, Sadak, Alawwad and Price all said they dressed up to celebrate Eid. Sadak celebrated with his family in his backyard, and Allawad called her family on Zoom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I bought my dress months in advance,” Price laughed. “I was so ready for it, I was gonna show off.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

For those who are stuck in quarantine, the struggle of food shopping only magnifies, Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faced with the puzzle of supplying community members with food while also keeping them safe amidst a pandemic, Cohen said the co-op sidestepped potential health hazards by </span><a href=\"https://islavistafoodcoop.storebyweb.com/s/1000-1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doing the shopping</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for its customers through an online order system while working with food distributors to keep products on the shelves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She described the last few months of keeping the co-op afloat as “a profound journey of dismantling, reestablishing, recalibrating, reinculturating, repurposing and recentering.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As much as Costco might’ve been easy or useful to deal with or Sprouts was a resource before, they’re not resources now. Corporate grocery could not help UCSB in [its] moment of need,” she continued. “I bet you don’t realize the power of having a community grocer right in your back pocket.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest advantages of running the co-op, as opposed to a corporate grocery store, is its lack of a corporate hierarchy, Cohen explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The uniqueness of being a small business at this time is very powerful,” she said, referring to the co-op’s flexibility in rolling out new rules and policies instantly without the need for higher-up approval. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The co-op leveraged this advantage in March, when out-of-towners flocked to the store after wiping clean the nearby Costco and Sprouts, Cohen said. She immediately implemented mask-wearing policies and purchase limits to keep a lid on the panic buying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of a sudden, the co-op was descended upon by non-students who are buying hundreds of dollars worth of stuff at one time when we’re used to, like, a $10, $15 shopping basket,” Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Overnight, the co-op was discovered as this off-the-beaten-path treasure as all these supermarkets have these crazy lines and people are freaking out, and then suddenly people are shopping at the co-op,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the panic buying, Cohen said the loss of a third of her workforce — the part-time </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students who left I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ride out the pandemic at home — was another symptom of the pandemic’s toll on the co-op. But her remaining staff, despite being “worked to the bone,” stepped up to meet the demand, she said; at its peak, sales at the co-op were up nearly 70%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To offset the burden of working during the pandemic, Cohen said the co-op has been paying all employees hazard pay — including $2-per-hour raises and cash bonuses — since March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the co-op’s new safety protocols include new rules for sick leave, a mask-wearing policy for workers and customers, cleaning guidelines and performing administrative work remotely, Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cohen also said she is grateful for the </span><a href=\"https://davisfood.coop/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis Food Co-op</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the I.V. Food co-op’s sister store up north, for sharing its pandemic response plan and giving the co-op an adaptable blueprint for future plans and protocols, and for Churchill, whose sanitizer orders sounded the alarm about the necessity of preparing the co-op for the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cohen said these efforts provided an added layer of security to the store by making customers and workers feel safe while inside the food co-op. But when it comes to the food supply chain, which is largely out of the hands of the co-op, some uncertainty still looms, according to Steve Snyder, the I.V. Food Co-op’s merchandising manager. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line, he said, is that the “food supply chain was robust until people lost their minds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the third week of March, the panic buying was so intense that customers were buying items straight off the delivery truck before they even hit the shelves, Snyder said. This briefly forced the co-op to put in orders to its food distributors that were twice its normal size, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So the panic buying, the hoarding, the desperate desire to get it before your neighbor gets it — that’s what broke the food supply chain. When [they] recommended that people remain calm, that is what we all should have done,” Snyder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There would be toilet paper on shelves if every person in North America, who could get four cases of 96-count toilet paper, didn’t go out and do that and build a fort in their garage,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snyder said there are currently a variety of holes in Southern California’s food supply chain, which is one of the largest and most impacted grocery regions in the U.S. Some of these gaps are reflected directly on the co-op’s shelves, where products such as rice, pasta, soup, toilet paper, bottled water and frozen fruits are either slowly returning in quantity or still out of stock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the food co-op is connected directly to growers around the state, Snyder said the quantity of some items, mainly produce, is not a concern. But when it comes to sourcing products from manufacturers and vendors — adding more layers to the supply chain — availability becomes more of an issue, Snyder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some warehouses used by </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-06-09/coronavirus-pandemic-food-supply\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manufacturers and vendors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to store products have bled dry from panic buying, Snyder said. This means that “they’ve either sold through everything and they have to wait for the 2020 harvest to begin reproducing for staples … or they haven’t sold through everything but they’re allotting shipments to specific warehouses to make sure that everybody gets a chance,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judging from his experiences during the coronavirus pandemic, Snyder said he’d down boil what he learned into two takeaways for the future: “Try to figure out how to not get caught off guard” and “put quantity limits in place sooner.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just wish that people would recognize that everyone should have access to food. And you’re not helping anyone, including yourself, if you’re buying a year’s or more supply of stuff,” he said. “That’s going to sit in your garage and eventually go stale, and then you’re going to send it to the landfill.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Cohen, the pandemic may have been full of learning experiences, but it was also a catalyst for growth. She recalled being wary of starting Co-op Curbside, the co-op’s grocery delivery service, but grew to appreciate the convenience — and necessity — of having such a service after seeing how it unified community members during a time of need. Now, she says, the co-op has immortalized the service and she can’t see the store without it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I always had said, ‘I think doing home delivery is ridiculous. The co-op is place-based and people need to come to the store; it’s about the experience,’” she said. “And, of course, I’ve been proven wrong.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same can also be said for hazard pay, Cohen said. Now, $15 per hour is the new normal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back at the strenuous months of March, April and May, Cohen said the pandemic has been a bumpy road for the co-op, in part because the store lost some of its identity in the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a place that prides itself on helping customers “feel safe and be seen,” Cohen said closing down the outdoor patio, canceling upcoming workshops and rolling out safety protocols made it all the more difficult to do that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But through it all, the community response has been “incredible,” Cohen said, pointing to moments of appreciation from new and long-term customers who saw the value in the co-op’s grocery delivery service and cleaning protocols and found comfort knowing that there would always be food on the shelves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for a small business with a generational stake in I.V. and a community of fervent supporters, Cohen is confident that the “new normal” will make the co-op stronger than ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you haven’t lived and loved Isla Vista and gone through your part of your life here, you will never know the magnitude of this community,” she said. “One of Isla Vista’s most magnificent attributes is that it is a community that is resilient and inspired. And every time we turn to the next calendar cycle, it’s a blank canvas — an opportunity for the next generation to show that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For us to get to be a part of this iteration of Isla Vista and feel like we’re actually doing work that the community is benefiting from — to me, there’s nothing better,” she said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Some noted that they had not originally planned to speak but became convinced to after seeing others do the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many speakers urged for allyship from non-Black communities and emphasized the need for people in a position of privilege to self-educate about the Black community’s struggles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black people are everywhere and deserve to feel safe everywhere,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers expressed discontent with the Black student experience at UCSB, noting a lack of resources and a small population of Black students, </span><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2019.20.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currently at 5%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the undergraduate student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walk in I.V. and see what it feels like to have everybody staring at you for no damn reason,” one speaker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other speakers shared personal accounts of police violence and fears that their Black loved ones could wrongly face violence or death at the hands of law enforcement. One speaker recounted a conversation with her younger sister in which her sister said she was afraid to go for a walk, or for her father to leave the house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I tried to tell her that she is safe, but I know in the back of my mind that that was not true. Even if she does everything right, even if she gives them no cause to bother her, there is a chance that she might become the victim of police brutality in this country just because of who she is,” the speaker said. </span></p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-94721-2-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94743\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-10\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94744\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-5\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8.jpg?fit=2048%2C872\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94768\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-8\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94747\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-3\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94742\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-1\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94741\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94746\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-7\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94745\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-6\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94748\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-SichengWang-4\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Sicheng Wang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/05\\/200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"94766\",\"title\":\"200530-GeorgeFloydProtest-KaiyiYang-2\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Kaiyi Yang \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethan Bertrand, a member of the I.V. Community Services District Board of Directors, recalled a conversation he had with his own father before his father visited I.V. for graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to say, ‘Dad, you’re an older black man walking around our community and some people may see you as a threat. Some people may not think that you belong here, which you do, but some people don’t understand that, so please be careful,’” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so hard for us to find the strength to battle through our tears to say that once again, we’re going to stand together and stand up,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers also stressed the need for Black voices to be heard and acknowledged by non-Black communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pay attention to Black voices. Stop trying to speak over us. Stop trying to tell us what the answer is,” one speaker said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several UCSB administrators were in attendance at the demonstration, including Katya Armistead, assistant vice chancellor and dean of student life; Aaron Jones, director of the Educational Opportunity Program; and Diana Collins Puente, director of community affairs, student development and leadership at UCSB’s Associated Students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s absence and lack of communication prior to the start of the march was widely criticized by participants. About halfway through the speeches, Yang sent out a mass email to the student body that addressed Floyd’s death and expressed sympathy for those affected by his death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His words mean very little to me at this point,” one speaker said after reading aloud Yang’s statement to the crowd.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 1:30 p.m., protestors marched through I.V. chanting and holding homemade signs, as employees at local businesses observed from behind windows or stood outdoors to cheer on protestors. Once it reached Del Playa Drive, the crowd drew Isla Vistans out onto their balconies and into their yards. Some observers held their own signs and clapped for protestors, while others silently stared as the crowd marched toward Sands Beach, gathering more marchers along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surfers on bikes and families with children stood off to the side while protestors made their way down the dirt trail to Sands Beach, eventually gathering in a circle in a small field, where the demonstration’s organizers thanked the crowd for its solidarity and called for 30 seconds of silence to remember Floyd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those 30 seconds, protesters held their fists high in the air, some closing their eyes, the sound of the breaking waves the only noise.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
