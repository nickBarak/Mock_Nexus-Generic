","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In today’s world, sleeping with someone on the first night isn’t exactly taboo. While there are still stigmas and judgments surrounding it, casually sleeping with someone right after meeting them is viewed by many as nothing more than harmless fun. For the most part, our generation has chosen to embrace and celebrate our sexuality rather than feel ashamed of it. However, some people still choose to maintain old-fashioned and modest views when it comes to sex.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a both guy- and girlfriends who believe that sex is great but simply aren’t willing to give it up on the first night. For them, sex contains many more strings than not, and comfortability is a huge factor. In reality, sex does require a certain level of security and comfort, and some people just naturally possess more of that than others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, while it may not seem like a big deal for many of us, casual sex can definitely have some not-so-casual consequences. From STIs to unwanted pregnancies, there is definitely an element of risk when it comes to sex. Considering these very real possibilities, it makes a lot of sense as to why some people hesitate before jumping into bed with someone who is practically a stranger. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, the way I feel about sex on the first night can be summed up with: to each their own. Some people are comfortable enough to partake in the thrill every weekend, some are a bit choosier and others refuse to take the bait. In my opinion, as long as you’re responsible and standing by your convictions, there’s no wrong answer.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>I even have a friend who was mid-makeout with some guy in a bathroom at a party, and when she said, “I’m not going to have sex with you in this bathroom,” he literally stopped, said “okay” and walked out the door.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, I think a lot of people, especially girls, feel a certain amount of pressure to conform to the hookup culture that we have here in I.V. Everyone here is surrounded by incredibly attractive and charming people. Everyone here is surrounded by options. Everyone here is surrounded by competition. Because of this, I think a lot of girls feel the need to give into a game that they really don’t want to play. And the truth is, no one should be making decisions about their body or sexuality based off of the fear that they will be tossed aside for someone else.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until recently I hadn’t realized how often this happens. It’s hard for me to believe that anyone could so blatantly disregard someone that they’ve just met, simply because they find out that they won’t be getting into their pants just hours after learning each other’s names. The fact that people even have the audacity to do such a thing is pretty shocking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know girls who have spent whole evening with guys, where they danced, kissed and had a great time, only to be completely dropped the second that they let it be known that sex wasn’t an option. I even have a friend who was mid-makeout with some guy in a bathroom at a party, and when she said, “I’m not going to have sex with you in this bathroom,” he literally stopped, said “okay” and walked out the door. She didn’t even give a complete rejection; she simply specified that she wouldn’t do it IN THE DAMN BATHROOM. At first, I thought it was an ego problem. I assumed that these guys were just arrogant, misguided, spoiled idiots with some sort of disturbing god complex. In reality, I think it’s actually the exact opposite.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a girl tells you that she’s not comfortable having sex the first night you’ve met, and you choose to respond in such a disgusting and disrespectful way, all that shows is how insecure you really are. It doesn’t make you look cool, desired or confident; it makes you look like a coward. Running at the slightest sign of rejection or effort literally shows how little self-esteem you must possess, and it’s somewhat laughable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are hundreds of girls in this town who will gladly sleep with guys on the first night, and if that’s what you’re looking for, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, reacting in such an immature and embarrassingly chauvinistic way is not an appropriate response when you run into someone who happens to have different intentions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has differing views and opinions when it comes to sex. However, one thing that everyone should agree upon is that no matter how you choose to go about it, respect is always involved, no matter what the circumstances. On top of that, I guarantee that making a girl (or guy in some cases) feel comfortable and respected will get you a whole lot farther in the bedroom than spinelessly attempting to manipulate or pressure your way into someone’s pants. Sex is supposed to be sexy, and coercion is not sexy. So if that’s your go-to tactic for maintaining your sex life, chance is you aren’t either.</span></p>\n<p><em>Allie Lebos wants you to have your sex with a healthy helping of respect. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-16/first-night-or-take-a-hike/","id":6362,"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos"},"related":[6361,6360,6359],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":395,"name":"Allie Lebos","biography":"Not available","articles":[6284,6286,6292,6299,6301,6303,6304,6305,6308,6342,6362],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Just the Tips: The Hump’s Buzzed Wisdom","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"\"Wednesday Hump\" author Hayley E. pops open a bottle of wine and reflects on her freshman year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Embarking upon my final year at UCSB and living with seven other voyagers in a similar boat, it’s natural that we reminisce about our freshman year and what we might have done differently.

Recently, I’ve been hearing more and more about “labiaplasty,” which is essentially plastic surgery on the vagina. If you’re feeling horrified right about now, we’re probably on the same page here. Now, I understand the importance of surgeries like this for people who are for example, intersex, but I want to focus here on those who are going under the knife for purely aesthetic reasons.</p>\n<p>Being insecure about your vagina is not uncommon — I’m pretty sure we’ve all at some point in the transformation of our lady gardens wondered, “Is this normal?” — and I want to start off by telling you that it probably is normal, but if you’re still worried about it, go to the doctor and ASK! Don’t let this shit interfere with your sex life because you have to be comfortable with yourself in order to enjoy yourself!</p>\n<p>Easier said than done, right? It might seem to you that every vagina you’ve ever seen looks way more normal than yours does. Or perhaps someone once told you that your vagina looks odd? Let’s just think about that for a second: I mean, what is the authority that’s setting the precedent for what a “normal” vagina looks like? If your answer is “porn,” then you can give yourself a smack in the face because I don’t know how many times this needs to be reiterated: PORN IS FICTION. All of those vaginas have been primped, primed and filmed from certain angles in order to fit in with the aesthetic idea of “The Vagina” that our culture seems to have espoused.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>First of all, let’s address the fucked-up-ness of having a completely hairless vagina with tiny pink labia that barely protrudes at all as our aesthetic ideal. What you’re striving for if you’re thinking that’s what your vagina should look like is to basically return to having unaroused and prepubescent genitals. Does that sound sexy?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a quick Wikipedia search for “labiaplasty” will tell you that the average length for the labia majora (the outside lips) can be between seven and 12 cm and for the labia minora (the inside ones) is between 20 and 100 mm. And those are only two parts of the whole. So basically, what constitutes a “normal” vagina is anything that falls within a huge spectrum, across a huge amount of variables, including color and shape. So that’s why I told you that your vagina, whatever it looks like, is probably normal. And yeah, because the vagina is such a complex thing, it usually looks like kind of a mess. But it’s still normal.</p>\n<p>So I suggest you all go and Google Image “labia” — as opposed to “pussy” or other less scientific terms — to get a real idea of what vaginas look like. Oh yeah, and relax, it’s just a vagina.</p>\n<p><em>Naomi Rea is a third-year English literature and philosophy double major.</em></p>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus</em> or UCSB.

This fine Wednesday, we’ve been lucky enough to have some of your peers sacrifice themselves on the altar of anonymous shame. It’s time for some sexual bloopers …</p>\n<p>“So I was having sex with this guy, and we were both pretty high. He happened to have silk sheets. While I was riding on top of him, my hands slipped and I fell, onto his face, headbutting him and inducing a massive nosebleed. Super cute.” —Shannon, second-year.</p>\n<p>“I was doing this girl from behind in the shower and got a little too enthusiastic: She ended up doing a somersault in the shower. Whoops.” —Kavon, third-year.</p>\n<p>“I had sex with a guy who held me up off of the ground, so I was totally reliant on his arm strength. When he came, he dropped me. He made up for it by giving me head after.” —Kathy, fourth-year.</p>\n<p>“I was having sex with this guy, and he legitimately bit my clit. I yelped, slapped his head away and snapped my legs closed, asking him if he would like it if I bit his dick. Seriously. Who thinks that’s going to feel good?” —Buttercup, fourth-year.</p>\n<p>“One time during my freshman year, I was with my boy at the dorms. We had the room to ourselves and were getting it on when we playfully rolled to the side on my lofted bed. He actually rolled off and landed face first on the floor six feet below! It was so funny to me that I couldn’t stop laughing, and it totally killed the mood. He even made this ‘Whoops!’ sound when he fell off.” —Yolanda, fourth-year.</p>\n<p>“One weekend, I had had a few too many shots and blacked out. I came to only to find my finger up an out-of-towner’s butt. The next day he told me no one had ever tried that with him before, and it was his new favorite thing. I was mortified, but I suppose it turned out to be a good thing.” —Mildred, fourth-year.</p>\n<p>“So my boyfriend at the time and I were in Vegas for a trip with friends, and we got a little too frisky. We were lounging in the pool when we decided to get it on … right there in the pool. So we drifted over to the manmade waterfall and started doing it underneath. We thought we were really sneaky. However, minutes later, the lifeguard came up to us and asked us to stop, embarrassed. ‘There are kids here,’ he said. We apologized and resolved to be a little more stealthy next time. Unfortunately everyone definitely knew what we were up to.” —Mariposa, third-year.</p>\n<p>“I knew a couple who were insistent on trying everything once. One time, the girl insisted they try anal sex in the heat of the moment with no real prior discussion on the subject. They knew they’d need lots of lube but because it was a spur of the moment decision, the only lube they had was chocolate flavored. It was their first and only time trying anal, and they used chocolate lube.” —Eli, fourth-year.</p>\n<p>“It was freshman year, and I was living in FT and I, of course, made the rookie mistake of hooking up with somebody on my floor. But how could I resist? He was so close and convenient. We had just finished. I was sitting on his bed, and I bent down to retrieve my clothes from the floor. It was dark, and I bumped my head on the corner of the wooden bedpost. It didn’t hurt that bad, so I figured it was just a bump. Well, he turned around with the most shocked look on his face and quickly handed me a paper towel. I pressed it to my forehead and realized that I was, in fact, gushing blood. There I was, sitting naked on his bed, forehead bleeding. As I held the paper towel on my cut, he attempted to help me get dressed. As soon as I was decent, I quickly retreated to my room where my drunk suitemates were waiting. At the sight of my forehead, they freaked out and called the injury to the attention of my entire floor. We came to a consensus that a trip to the hospital was needed, and I ended up with five stitches on my left eyebrow. Trying to explain to the nurse what happened was awkward to say the least.” —Delilah, second-year.</p>\n<p>“When I was still in high school, my ex-boyfriend and I were doing a theater show together. One day we stayed late after school and decided we wanted to do it on the set. While going at it, face-to-face with my legs thrown over his and sitting up, the sixth-grade class came into the room. Luckily we were wearing most of our clothes, so I just hugged him very tightly and cried, ‘We’re just hugging!’ It was so humiliating.” —Margo, second-year.</p>\n<p>“I grew up in Solvang. One night, my girlfriend and I had smoked up in my car on the side of the road before we started boning. In the middle of it all, we suddenly heard a knock on the window. The guy disturbing us was the most small-town cop you could imagine, and he was ready to punish us. He made us both get out of the car, her wearing only my shirt, me wearing only my boxers. He made us stand there for two hours while he called both of our parents (we were 16) to come and get us. This was especially bad as her parents were super conservative and religious: They didn’t know their baby girl was having sex or smoking weed. To top it all off, a group of people from the house up the hill having a party drove down to witness our embarrassment. I had to go in front of a judge, but that wasn’t the worst part. The worst part was getting dressed up in a suit and going to plead my case to her parents.” —Iglesias, third-year.</p>\n<p>Wham, bam, no thank you, ma’am — these are all wince-worthy. The Great Gaucho is pleased by your sacrifices. I am even more in love with my job now that you brave souls have sent these in. Now go forth, bask in your sexuality (perhaps more safely and stealthily this time!) and remember, avoid silk sheets and chocolate lube at all costs. Happy Humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. knows that sex can be more “whoopsie” than “whoopee!” All there is left to do is get back up and try, try, try again.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared in the Wednesday, February 20, 2013 print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/sex-goes-slapstick-gaucho-bedroom-bloopers-exposed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/sex-goes-slapstick-gaucho-bedroom-bloopers-exposed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/sex-goes-slapstick-gaucho-bedroom-bloopers-exposed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/sex-goes-slapstick-gaucho-bedroom-bloopers-exposed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/sex-goes-slapstick-gaucho-bedroom-bloopers-exposed/","id":6361,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6360,6359,6358],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
