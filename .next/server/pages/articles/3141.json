I’m now satisfied with believing that LeBron’s the better athlete while Kobe’s the better player — putting aside his recent struggles handling the ball. But it worries me to think that people are looking only at PER to determine a player’s value or using the stat to judge high school and college talent. It worries me more that it’s become so mainstream and that other columnists use it to measure a player’s success in the same way they use points scored.</p>\n<p>An ESPN columnist himself, Hollinger developed PER to standardize the measure of a player’s total performance. He combines the individual player’s statistics with team statistics, weighting each individual stat differently. With some help from PEMDAS, the numbers plug into the formula to yield a number rounded to the hundredth. Hollinger sets the average PER in the NBA to 15.00. The best players have PERs in the 20s.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Michael Jordan owns the best career PER by one full point at 27.91. Of course he does. LeBron’s in second place at 26.91. Kobe? He’s at No. 18, sandwiched between Dr. J and Larry Bird.</p>\n<p>Maybe the formula is accurate. Maybe it proves that Michael Jordan is truly the best there ever was. At least, the best there ever was after 1978, when the league started calculating usage rates used in the PER formula.</p>\n<p>Or maybe Hollinger manipulated the weighting of each of the statistics included in PER to ensure MJ was the best. Making MJ the best gives PER legitimacy. What if, back in 2006 when he published the details of PER in his basketball prospectus, Hollinger had weighted the numbers to prioritize rebounding a little more? Shaquille O’Neal is at No. 3 on the PER list as it currently stands.  What if he were the face of Hollinger’s baby?</p>\n<p>Chances are good that ESPN wouldn’t have embraced it as much as they have. The notion that Michael’s the best ever is probably the least controversial of all the “Best of” notions you can make about the NBA.</p>\n<p>Advanced statistics in basketball simply don’t dictate player value very well. Hollinger himself admits that PER fails to quantify the value of defensive specialists — such as Bruce Bowen — who tend to guard the best players but don’t produce many steals or blocks. Even this season’s likely MVP Derrick Rose is victimized by PER, cracking the top 10 but losing to the likes of the Thunder’s Russell Westbrook and the Timberwolves’ Kevin Love.</p>\n<p>The statistic is intended to be an all-encompassing basketball rating. If it doesn’t account for the value of “X-factor” plays that players make, what’s the point?</p>\n<p>Give me points, rebounds and assists. Give me blocked shots and field-goal percentage. Hell, give me the number of championship rings. There’s no statistical truth deeper than the ones you can calculate by simply tallying up totals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NBA columnist Ravi Bhatia’s work PER is surprisingly low. It probably doesn’t include dick size.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37178\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-26/hoop-dreams-hollingers-total-stat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37178\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-26/hoop-dreams-hollingers-total-stat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-26/hoop-dreams-hollingers-total-stat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-26/hoop-dreams-hollingers-total-stat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-26/hoop-dreams-hollingers-total-stat/","id":3141,"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia"},"related":[3140,3139,3138],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia","biography":"Not available","articles":[114,207,291,610,826,827,829,830,831,832,835,850,859,860,864,866,872,873,875,876,878,888,893,897,903,906,909,910,911,912,916,918,923,1711,1718,1721,1734,1735,1737,1738,1754,2037,2133,2156,2300,2889,2891,3141,3170,4553,4555,4556,5531,5549],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Food Bank.</p>\n<p>In explaining the California State Budget’s impact on the education system, third-year student Ajinkya Joshi discussed Governor Jerry Brown’s priorities in educational funding and also said tuition costs are expected to remain unchanged in the upcoming years.</p>\n<p>“He’s going to focus on making a five percent increase in the general fund to schools and higher education,” Joshi said. “Essentially, our tuition won’t be increasing; it will be stable, and the UCs and CSUs are going to be aiming to try to increase innovation and trying to make it so that way more of us graduate at a lower cost.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Joshi said the current problems in higher education are that the UCs have a higher cost structure and higher per student subsidy.</p>\n<p>“Right now the problem is trying to maintain the quality of education while keeping the costs low for the student,” Joshi said.</p>\n<p>Although Joshi’s presentation covered a fairly large quantity of information that would directly impact UCSB students, Senators came close to denying Joshi sufficient time to make the presentation. The vote on granting Joshi his requested 10 minutes of extra time turned out to be a tie until Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet broke it with a vote in favor of the time extension.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore spoke briefly on plans for Deltopia, the annual student-organized event coming up this Spring Quarter, regarding efforts to provide extra police units, Port-a-Potties and access to drinking water during the festivities. Moore said he will advocate for a similar system established during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“What I want to do is an expanded version of what we did for Halloween,” Moore said. “We’ll have a hydration station and some sort of safety effort as well.”</p>\n<p>Chair of A.S. Food Bank and third-year economics and accounting major Erick Lankey reported on a series of upcoming events geared toward enhancing student involvement and knowledge about the Food Bank. According to Lankey, these events include “how to eat on a low budget” tours through the I.V. Food Co-op, an extreme couponing team contest and a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program challenge in which participants pledge to live on $31.50 of food for a week in an effort to gain empathy for the challenges faced by individuals living on food stamps.</p>\n<p>The presentation received positive feedback from Off-Campus Senators Andre Taylor and Nick Onyshko. Taylor said he was “very excited” to participate, and Onyshko said he applauds the Food Bank for its growth as an organization.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to say all this stuff sounds amazing, and I’m really impressed with everything you’ve done with this committee,” Onyshko said.</p>\n<p>Bills passed during the meeting included a bill to update Take Back the Night’s legal code as well as another bill that limits the amount of money campus BCCs spend on food per quarter to $500 or less, depending on the size of the particular BCC, as part of an effort to reduce wasteful spending. A bill to establish a new A.S. logo was tabled for another week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/a-s-senate-focuses-on-budgets-deltopia-other-projects/","id":3138,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3137,3136,3135],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ballin’ Workshop Teaches Students Budgeting Basics","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Ballin’ on a Budget,” a workshop which took place last night in the Student Resource Building, tutored students in “financial basics,” such as creating and managing a budget and applying fo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Student Resource Building Hosts Workshop For Basic Financing Techniques</h3>\n<p>“Ballin’ on a Budget,” a workshop which took place last night in the Student Resource Building, tutored students in “financial basics,” such as creating and managing a budget and applying for a credit card.</p>\n<p>The event was hosted by third-year feminist studies major Rachel McCormack of the Women’s Center and Jose Raygoza, coordinator and advisor for the Associated Students Community Financial Fund, which offers increased access to grants and A.S. emergency loans. Beginning with a presentation about how students can figure out how to effectively spend money on a budget, the presentation later gave a detailed look at how credit works.</p>\n<p>According to Raygoza, budgeting is an essential skill everyone, especially students, should know, particularly in light of numerous expenses such as “paying for books next quarter, or going on vacation” and “traveling abroad” in the midst of rising tuition costs and other strains on student finances.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has dreams and goals, and everyone can achieve them,” Raygoza said. “A good way to start planning towards your goals is to create a financial spending plan.”</p>\n<p>However, while having a spending plan is important, Raygoza noted that even more important than sticking to a plan is to defer from overspending, which can be difficult amidst what he said is the plethora of purchasable temptations in today’s consumer culture.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of choices in how we spend our money,” Raygoza said.</p>\n<p>While saying that spending money on entertainment can be important to one’s well-being, Raygoza said it is essential to determine how much can be allocated to certain expenses. To do this, Raygoza said students should keep a spending diary for a month and reconsider what classifies as ‘needs’ and ‘wants.’ He also recommended developing cost-cutting habits, such as using public transportation, attending free events, volunteering, brewing your own coffee and taking advantage of student discounts.</p>\n<p>“Ballin’ on a Budget” presenters also discussed interest and annual percentage rates, the usefulness of credit for emergency purchases and larger expenses, as well as the differences between debit, credit, ATM and stored value cards. Speakers also recommended finding out credit scores through Equifax, Experian, TransUnion and <em>www.annualcreditreport.com.</em></p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Amanda Pheng, who attended the event, said the workshop was useful in terms of bettering her understanding of how to handle personal finances.</p>\n<p>“It is stressful. I have to worry about utilities, gas, groceries and other stuff like that. It’s hard sometimes to figure what I need to spend and what I have money for,” Pheng said. “I think it’s always good to budget yourself a little bit better.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Wednesday, January 29, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53769\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53769\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/ballin-workshop-teaches-students-budgeting-basics/","id":3139,"author":{"id":185,"name":"Michael Coronado"},"related":[3138,3137,3136],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Voice Concerns at A.S.

A.S. hopes the meeting encouraged communication between the students and A.S. </p></div>Associated Students held a transitional forum yesterday in the MultiCultural Center to encourage student feedback about the association’s plans for the upcoming year.\n<p>A panel of both incoming and outgoing executive officers led a roundtable discussion among roughly 50 student participants on issues such as the student government’s spending priorities and ongoing projects. The forum aimed to promote transparency within A.S. through an open discussion of topics ranging from increased recycling efforts to student involvement in budgetary issues.</p>\n<p>A.S. President-elect Harrison Weber, a third-year history of public policy major, said the event sought to promote better communication among the association’s various entities and with the student body.</p>\n<p>“A.S. should work on how they can work together,” Weber said. “The forum was a place to listen and talk about what the priorities for next year should be.”</p>\n<p>The forum also served as a medium for students to discuss solutions to next year’s significantly impacted budget. According to current Internal Vice President Jake Elwood, a fourth-year political science major, the association will receive the same amount of funding for 2011-12 as they did for this Spring Quarter alone.</p>\n<p>“We have this mind of expansion but really we’re shrinking,” Elwood said. “We need to change our focus of where we spend our money.”</p>\n<p>Elwood said next year’s executives will need to concentrate on refocusing the management of student fees.</p>\n<p>“A.S. can still grow; we just have to change our mindset,” Elwood said. “Food and T-shirts at every meeting is a luxury. We can do more, but in different ways.”</p>\n<p>Current A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez, a fourth-year sociology and global studies major, said student leaders are responsible for incorporating students’ interests into the association’s goals.</p>\n<p>“As elected officials, it is their job to help the grassroots movements,” Monge-Rodriguez said. “Associated Students needs to be associated to the students. If not, then you’re irrelevant.”</p>\n<p>Persian Student Group Co-President Armand Armin, a second-year economics and global studies major, said next year’s officials should develop focused outreach efforts to reach the greater campus community.</p>\n<p>“There are different communities of students that are working really hard on all the issues A.S. is working on,” Armin said. “I think A.S. is ignoring these grassroots movements. You have to look at communities that are actually doing work. It’s not just the students, it’s the families — families that have been here for decades and are being ignored by students.”</p>\n<p>On-Campus Representative Joseph Lee, a second-year political science major, said it is vital to provide information about student governmental matters to students who are living off campus.</p>\n<p>“We need to put A.S. in new students’ heads, but we also want to get the off-campus population involved as well,” Lee said. “We should also think about transferring the good momentum that was built this year to next year.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/students-voice-concerns-forum/","id":3140,"author":{"id":213,"name":"Daniela Montes"},"related":[3139,3138,3137],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
