Its next seven games will be away from Santa Barbara and it currently holds a 2-3 record.</p>\n<p>Combine that with the fact that Pepperdine is 9-6 at home this year with wins over quality teams such as fellow Big West counterpart Cal Poly, and the Gauchos could be in some trouble.</p>\n<p>The Waves will make it hard for their opponent most notably with their ability to hit the long ball as their 20 home runs as a team this season ranks 45<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine’s hitting is led by young outfielder, Matthew Kanfer. The freshman leads the team in batting average (.348) and is tied for first in RBI (18).</p>\n<p>Kanfer had a breakout performance two weekends ago as he contributed nine hits, 11 RBI, one home run and five runs scored in four games against Columbia University.</p>\n<p>Other solid hitters include junior infielder Manny Jefferson who leads the team in home runs (5), first in slugging percentage (.585) tied for first in RBI (18), and junior outfielder Matt Gelalich who leads the team in on base percentage (.429)</p>\n<p>In today’s match-up, Pepperdine will most likely throw junior Chandler Blanchard on the mound. The right-hander has had his struggles as he currently boasts a 1-1 record with a 4.61 ERA after allowing seven runs on 13 hits in 13.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>The junior will have a tough time as he will face one of the best hitting teams in the country in UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to key players such as recently named Big West Field Player of the Week, Josh Adams, to keep up their strong play. The redshirt sophomore leads the team in home runs with five.</p>\n<p>Adams received POTW honors after a great week in which he batted 5-12 (.417), six RBI, and one home run. UCSB would love to see him carry that momentum into today’s game.</p>\n<p>Fellow teammate and the other POTW recipient from a couple weeks ago, sophomore first baseman Austin Bush, will also do his part. The strong hitter leads the team in RBI (21), ranks second in hits (22) and is third in batting average (.328).</p>\n<p>Another player who has caught some fire as of late is redshirt sophomore Dempsey Grover. The catcher leads the team in batting average (.421), hits (24) and on base percentage (.519).</p>\n<p>Possible starter for today’s game in terms of pitching could be freshman Kyle Hatton (2-0). The left hander has done well in limited time registering a 1.29 ERA as he has only allowed one run and three hits while striking out five batters in seven innings pitched.</p>\n<p>This game, as well as these next seven matches, will be very telling of the Gauchos. Although they have had a great start to the season, they need to be able to prove they can win away from home.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is today against Pepperdine at 3 p.m at Eddy D.

They added one run to their lead in the top of the third inning to make the score 2-0.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the third frame the Trojans woke up as they rallied a four-run inning, due in large part to senior out fielder Timmy Robinson’s three-run homer, to take the lead at 4-2.</p>\n<p>They then added one run in the fifth as well as the sixth, thanks to another Robinson home run, to extend the lead to 6-2.</p>\n<p>In the sixth inning USC put away the Gauchos scoring three more runs courtesy of junior catcher Jeremy Martinez two-RBI double, and Robinson’s sac-fly RBI.</p>\n<p>UCSB tried to respond scoring two runs in the seventh after redshirt junior out fielder Andrew Calica’s two-RBI triple but it would not be enough as it eventually fell to the Trojans 9-5. The loss snapped the previous nine-game winning streak Santa Barbara was on.</p>\n<p>Pitchers Joe Record, a sophomore redshirt, and Chris Clements, a sophomore, both struggled in the game. Record (3-2) picked up the loss after allowing five runs on seven hits in four innings while Clements allowed four runs on five hits in 1.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Before the tough loss that snapped their streak, the Gauchos extended it to nine after another home victory. Solid pitching was the key in this game as the team of Noah Davis and Kyle Nelson held the Trojans to two runs.</p>\n<p>USC began the scoring in this game after senior David Oppenheim hit an RBI double down the left field line to take the early 1-0 lead. Its lead was extended to 2-0 in the third after an error by the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB began its comeback in the bottom of the fourth frame when Adams hit a two-run double to tie the game at 2-2. It then took the lead in the fifth inning after an RBI single by sophomore DH Austin Bush which brought Calica home.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added one run in both the sixth and eighth inning thanks to freshman Michael McAdoo’s RBI fielder’s choice and redshirt sophomore J.J. Muno’s RBI triple respectively.</p>\n<p>Davis (2-0), a freshman, pitched a solid game allowing one earned run on four hits and struck out four batters on six innings pitched earning him the victory.</p>\n<p>Nelson also continued his excellent season picking up his second save after pitching three innings and allowing three hits and no runs. The sophomore has only allowed one run the entire season.</p>\n<p>To begin the three-game series, Santa Barbara came into the match-up looking to avenge the loss that knocked them out of the regionals last year. Coming in hot, off two previous weekend sweeps, it was ready to get some sort of revenge.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out swinging and put away USC early. It out hit USC 12-6 and scored 10 runs while holding USC to one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos began the scoring putting three runs on the board in the bottom of the second inning courtesy of one Trojan error and a two-run homer by Adams, his fourth of the year.</p>\n<p>They added two more runs in the fourth inning courtesy of Calica’s RBI single and a balk committed by the pitcher led to senior Ryan Clark scoring making the score 5-0.</p>\n<p>USC added one run in the fifth inning but it was not enough as UCSB proceeded to score five runs over the next two innings to secure the 10-1 victory. It was the sixth time it scored 10 or more runs in a game.</p>\n<p>Clark had a solid game going 3-4 (.750) with one RBI and two runs scored. Another notable hitter was junior utility Billy Fredrick who went 2-4 (.500) with one run scored and one RBI.</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Shane Bieber (4-1) picked up his fourth win of the season after going seven innings and allowing only one run on five hits while registering two strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The big lead allowed coach Checketts to throw in freshman pitcher Kevin Chandler to get some solid playing time. The right-hander pitched two full innings, almost as much as he pitched in his previous four games combined, and allowed one hit, no runs while striking out two batters.</p>\n<p>The weekend was another solid one for the UCSB baseball team. It won another series and although it’s winning streak was stopped, there is no doubt that the team is having a great season thus far.</p>\n<p>However, it will be important to see how Santa Barbara bounces back after a loss. Also the team will be away from home for the next seven games so it will be interesting to see how that could possibly affect the team.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game is Tuesday, March 29 against Pepperdine at 3 p.m at Eddy D. Field Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Following a sacrifice bunt and a line-out, UCSB pitcher Kyle Hatton lost control of the inning, walking and hitting the next two batters before allowing a two RBI single to center field off the bat of shortstop Justin Bridgman.</p>\n<p>After hitting the right fielder Trenton Brooks to again load the bases, Hatton overthrew a pickoff attempt to first base, allowing Nevada to score catcher Kaleb Foster and Justin Bridgman before a deep fly ball to center ended the inning with the WolfPack holding a 4-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>Despite the rough stretch, coach Andrew Checketts stuck with his freshman lefty which payed off as Hatton settled in nicely, throwing four and a third more innings of scoreless baseball.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started a scoring barrage of their own in the bottom of the third, led by standout Muno who hit a single to right field. After advancing to second on a wild pitch and stealing third, freshman second baseman Tevin Mitchell hit Muno home with a scorching double to right-center field.</p>\n<p>Following walks from redshirt junior Andrew Calica and redshirt sophomore Josh Adams to load the bases, redshirt sophomore catcher Dempsey Grover singled to center field bringing in both Mitchell and Calica for a total of three runs in the inning.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Kyle Nelson’s first inning was impressive considering he inherited runners on first and second base left by the starter Hatton. After coaxing a fly out to center from junior right fielder Trenton Brooks, senior third baseman Bryce Greager reached first to load the bases on a fielding error by Muno. The left hander showed his resiliency, however, and struck out the final batter to get out of the inning unscathed.</p>\n<p>Carrying a 4-3 deficit into the bottom of the eighth, the Gauchos started the inning hot with a double rocketed down the left field line by Grover. Junior utility Billy Fredrick followed with a weak bunt, but was able to beat the throw to first with a beautiful slide.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Devon Gradford, a defensive substitute in the top of the frame, then reached first on a fielding error by the first baseman Jordan Pearce, advancing Fredrick to second and scoring Grover, tying the game at four.</p>\n<p>Muno then bunted the two baserunners over to second and third before a long fly ball by senior Ryan Clark, pinch hitting for freshman Tevin Mitchell, was caught by the center fielder who was unable to throw out Billy Fredrick tagging up from third giving the Gauchos their first lead of the game at 5-4.</p>\n<p>Despite a single in the last inning by junior shortstop Justin Bridgman, Nelson had no problem shutting down the Wolfpack, and earning his sixth win of the season.</p>\n<p>Muno was the star of the game for UCSB, going two for three and making several essential plays for his team, especially his batting work in the third and eighth innings. He continued his stellar play from the weekend series against Cal State Northridge, showing his versatility in his ability to toggle between second and third base.</p>\n<p>Coach Checketts liked the play of his freshman second baseman Tevin Mitchell, who unfortunately is simply buried on the depth chart by the wealth of infield talent on the roster. Checketts noted, however, that Mitchell, “had really good at-bats, played good defense at second base,” and that they see him as a, “future star.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is Friday, April 22 against their biggest rival Cal Poly at 6 p.m. at Robin Baggett Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70122\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/no-13-ucsb-downs-nevada-for-13th-straight-home-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70122\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/no-13-ucsb-downs-nevada-for-13th-straight-home-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/no-13-ucsb-downs-nevada-for-13th-straight-home-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/no-13-ucsb-downs-nevada-for-13th-straight-home-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/no-13-ucsb-downs-nevada-for-13th-straight-home-victory/","id":4184,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[4183,4182,4181],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"CSD Launches Community Beautification App, Plans to Employ Houseless Community Members","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0775.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0775.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The I.V.

CSD) Board President Spencer Brandt said at the launch on Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt recalled the first time he visited I.V. with his family and said it was “clear from the beginning that this was a place that was special.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was also clear what my parents’ opinion of it was, which was that it’s weird that there are mattresses lying on the corner, and that there’s trash in the gutters,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all know, standing here today, both as folks who have lived in Isla Vista and those who have been coming here for years, that’s not what Isla Vista is really about. But it does say something about the fact that there is a lot of quality of life issues that can be improved here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt hopes to appease these concerns through the use of SeeClickFix. By using the app as a mobile steward, users can help keep the streets of I.V. clean simply with their phones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we aim to do with this program is to solve those problems, through graffiti abatement and other sorts of cleaning, in a way that includes all of our community in the conversation and recognizes that folks experiencing homelessness are members of our community and are valued members of our community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt noted that there’s been a “rise in rhetoric” in the county that has dehumanized houseless people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really think that in Isla Vista, we here can be a model for trying to solve these problems and help them get back on their feet rather than pretending that if we just push things out of sight, out of mind, that the issue doesn’t exist,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who also spoke at the launch Sunday, took a moment to acknowledge Cesar Chavez’s birthday, and the “community building behaviors” that he demonstrated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann referenced the <a href=\"https://streetsteam.org/index\">Downtown Streets Team</a> in the Bay Area, which works toward “ending homelessness by restoring the dignity and rebuilding the lives of unhoused men and women,” according to the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They first did a survey of homeless people and found that it’s not being cold, it’s not being hungry, it’s being invisible. That’s the hardest thing about being homeless,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this program allows really a triple bottom line: to give people jobs and get them engaged, it makes your community better and it makes each one of us more connected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christina Lydick, beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista, said the program was going through the final stages of hiring at the moment. She anticipates bringing on five to seven people to work on graffiti abatement and other beautification initiatives in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers on Sunday went to work tackling the first few requests sent in by I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud to clean up the I.V. Community Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud initially utilized SeeClickFix in 2012, when he worked in Associated Students. Back then, he said, the program was much simpler, and there was no designated group working to fix the problems.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were working on county issues and trying to figure out how we can make Isla Vista better with no local government back then,” he said. “We’d see what people put in and we’d try to work on them each without a coherent system and without dedicated staff.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the I.V. CSD was looking for ways to launch the beautification program, they considered simpler options, like Google Forms, but knew that it wouldn’t give them the ability to collect the data that they wanted to, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once they reached out to SeeClickFix, the board found it to be the most effective and reasonably priced option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud said the district spent approximately $5,700 for a one-year subscription, which included the district with two accounts, one for Abboud and one for Lydick, and the support of the SeeClickFix team in setting up and managing the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The service has improved exponentially since Abboud first used it when he was an undergraduate, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Before it was [a] very text-based website…I don’t even think it had a GPS,” he said. “It was brand new.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the program is much more user-friendly, he said, and the company has helped the I.V. CSD set up the front end of their app and design a workflow system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud also noted that it has been helpful to hear from the company about how other cities have developed their apps. For the I.V. CSD, one of the most important aspects of the app is its ability to collect data on the kind of work requests it is receiving and how many of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the long term if we had that data accumulate, we’ll just know better in terms of how we’re spending our money and what we’re getting done,” Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the work orders are limited to graffiti, trash, vandalism and lighting issues for now, the board hopes to expand it to include fixing potholes and uneven sidewalks, and even potentially partnering with UC Santa Barbara to collect work orders for on-campus problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll do things like that in the future, but we wanted to launch with what we can, with a minimum viable product, which is this beautification kind of stuff, and then we’ll move towards other areas in the future,” Abboud said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
