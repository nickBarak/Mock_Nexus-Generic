While Gregory quoted a stuntwoman, she believes it also applies to the world of scribing. One needs confidence to boost creativity and strong determination to turn obstacles into opportunities, especially if you’re a woman trying to advance a career.</p>\n<p>And that’s the focus of the festival where women writers from all walks of life and ethnicities come together to support their work in promoting social justice, sharing insights and skills to hone their writing and celebrating their creativity and achievements.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Co-founder Sharon Hoshida welcomed WLF participants to the Fess Parker hotel with a salute to the power of words.</p>\n<p>“Forming the words, giving them sound … it unleashes the power of the imagination, the creative spirit, touching the collective consciousness, moving the mind and the emotions into a rhythm of solidarity and oneness,” Hoshida said. “That is what we are here today to do, to savor and enjoy together.”</p>\n<p>The festival began with renowned journalist and award-winning author Ann Louise Bardach, who exemplifies fearlessness with her successful pursuit interviews with the elusive Cuban leader Fidel Castro for <em>Vanity Fair</em>. She has also produced other high-profile stories on Cuba-Miami political affairs for the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The</em> <em>Atlantic</em> and was featured on NPR, <em>60 Minutes</em> and other broadcast programs.</p>\n<p>Bardach understood that, as a journalist, one must be a good writer and a good detective, something she discovered when interviewing Marita Lorenz, a woman involved in an affair with and an assassination attempt on Castro.</p>\n<p>“First of all, you’re always dealing with smoke and mirrors at a level you’ve never dealt with,” Bardach said, “and almost all Cuban stories are partially true. There’s a large part that isn’t true, and it’s your job as a reporter to figure this out.”</p>\n<p>Crime fiction author Kelli Stanley concurred with Bardach’s insight because she tackles “smoke and mirrors” on a daily basis through her Miranda Corbie series of 1940 San Francisco noir novels and short stories.</p>\n<p>Though Stanley’s novels are crime thrillers, they essentially deal with those on society’s margins who are voiceless. She credits this inspiration to her working class background as daughter of a man who was a son of a coal miner and a woman whose mother left school at 12 to become a factory worker.</p>\n<p>“The ’40s I wanted to write about is a ’40s of people who don’t have a voice,” Stanley said, “who do not get called the ‘greatest generation,’ who get shoved aside in our yen to put on rose-colored glasses for this particular period of time.”</p>\n<p>Thus, Stanley created Miranda Corbie, a private investigator with the ability to move between worlds and classes of people separated by economic divides. But more than moving across barriers in pursuit of social justice, Miranda also breaks some of her own as a female detective.</p>\n<p>“With Miranda, my goal in the face of every rerun of <em>Double Indemnity </em>and just about every book James M. Cain wrote, which are all pretty misogynistic, I wanted to flip noir itself on its ear,” Stanley said. “I wanted to take a woman who had every aspect of a femme fatale — from being sexual to being smart, strong, successful, ambitious and knowing it — characteristics that have been demonized in Western literature, and, instead of being the root of all evil, I wanted to make her the hero.”</p>\n<p>Notions of diversity in voice and experience continued to reverberate after Stanley’s talk in a breakout session involving filmmaker and writer Grace DeSoto Ferry, whose humorous and nostalgic works illustrate the struggles of growing up Mexican in San Antonio, and poet and artist Angela Peñaredondo whose writings draw upon multi-cultural experiences of moving back and forth between another country and the homeland.</p>\n<p>Also included in the breakout session was writer and illustrator of children’s literature Kathryn Otoshi, who discussed how her background as a graphic designer and multimedia art director in the film industry informs the drawings in her books. After working for companies such as Robert Zemeckis’s ImageMovers and George Lucas’s Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Otoshi began to see books as mini-films.</p>\n<p>“If you think about it, there’s this opportunity to be the set production designer where the backgrounds need to be created,” Otoshi said. “You’re directing the actors and sometimes you need to do it over and over because it’s not right, so you’re doing take one, take two, take three. And when you turn the page, that’s like a cut in a scene, so you suddenly become the editor.”</p>\n<p>Though Otoshi’s illustrations may be as simple as color blobs and numbers, their messages of using empowerment and self-confidence to overcome self-doubt and bullying run deep with Otoshi’s ability to create tone and attitude in simplicity. While reading through her works, she asked attendees to pretend they were back in sixth grade and led them through exercises designed to engage children such as spreading their arms high above the head, making a circle, then bringing it in front of them.</p>\n<p>“Pretend it’s a magnifying glass,” Otoshi said. “Past skin and bones and your clothing lives something called your character: Bravery, courage, kindness and being thoughtful, responsible, respectful and honest lives in here. The goal is to fill it up, up, up with all these things until it gets so full it overflows. And that’s how we can stand up straight and tall again.”</p>\n<p>Following the morning discussions on arts and media, UCLA Associate Professor of Chican@ and African American Studies Gaye Theresa Johnson transported the audience to the idea of space in terms of social justice.</p>\n<p>Johnson’s works explore topics of civil rights, activism and spatial struggles, particularly how occupying space can signal presence, how power involves controlling space and how people can render certain spaces as meaningful.</p>\n<p>She presented a vast narrative of those affected by gentrification, poverty lines, segregation, immigrant detention and mass incarceration. These developments, she emphasized, are often either ignored or scantily reported in the media due to a lack of meaningful engagement to really understand what these issues are truly about.</p>\n<p>“Writers have to be good listeners,” Johnson said. “It’s often very difficult to listen to the stories that don’t have neat resolutions like the ones that we’re paid to write about, but this is something that brings us back to this notion of community-engaged writing, because we have to look at these bigger struggles.”</p>\n<p>Gregory, who succeeded Johnson, certainly embodies the quality of a good listener through her nonfiction works, <em>Women Who Run the Show: How A Brilliant and Creative New Generation Stormed Hollywood </em>and <em>Stuntwomen: The Untold Hollywood Story</em>, detailing the lives of professional women in the entertainment industry. In addition to the risks involved (especially regarding stunt work), these women are often faced with limited job opportunities, unequal pay and sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>“We were in a war!” one interviewee told Gregory, which inspired her to title major sections of <em>Women Who Run the Show </em>in military terms. Part One was titled “The Beachhead: an area on hostile shores seized and defended to secure further landing of troops and supplies.”</p>\n<p>From these interviews, Gregory learned that these perilous challenges are more than just women trying to break into a “boys’ club” sector or crashing through windows; they also help build characters and confidence, which apply to everyone in different ways. And the real hazards are the good risks not taken.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s investigating social issues as a journalist and academic or exploring their themes through symbolic illustrations, expressive words and detective characters, the WLF not only celebrated the achievements and triumphs of equality but also highlighted the work left to do.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71276\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/2016-womens-literary-festival-brings-insight-inspiration/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71276\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/2016-womens-literary-festival-brings-insight-inspiration/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/2016-womens-literary-festival-brings-insight-inspiration/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/2016-womens-literary-festival-brings-insight-inspiration/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/2016-womens-literary-festival-brings-insight-inspiration/","id":6959,"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do"},"related":[6958,6957,6956],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":243,"name":"Phi Do","biography":"Not available","articles":[3824,3921,3922,4310,4445,5876,5902,5929,5944,5952,5975,5996,5998,6030,6040,6063,6476,6524,6949,6951,6953,6959,6960],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Ryan Davidson Brings Folk Punk to the Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/10168568.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/10168568.jpg?resize=620%2C413&ssl=1","description":"Red lights glimmered at Velvet Jones last Sunday, April 12, as Ryan Davidson prepared to hit the stage.

The muggy and thick smell of sweat from the rock show that had just taken place wafted through the air as people walked in and out of the venue, some sober and others not so much. Tattoo-decorated bodies began to usher in, creating a small but vivacious crowd. Clad in a t-shirt and jeans, Davidson looked cool as a cucumber as he mingled with the show-goers. You would think that the newbie singer-songwriter would have been more nervous to perform, but performing is a cathartic experience for Davidson. The jitters didn’t seem to bubble up to the surface as he took the stage.</p>\n<p>Davidson’s folky voice echoed through the venue, and although the audience was small, it was clear to see that he was giving it his all. With a harmonica and guitar in hand, he got to work and put on a show full of folky and punky songs which told stories of life on the road and the people he has encountered along the way.</p>\n<p>The song “Catherine” seemed to be especially important to the singer as he told the crowd that it was about his great grandmother. He also sang a song inspired by a friend who was diagnosed with Huntington’s disease, a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects muscle coordination and mental behavior.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Even with these tunes that had heavier themes, Davidson still managed to keep it light, joking with the audience that was full of what seemed to be his close friends.

I enjoy the cathartic aspect of it as well. It’s a release for me. That’s the biggest part for me, but I also love seeing people get into it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>BG:</strong> What music do you have on repeat right now?</p>\n<p><strong>RD:</strong> Shovels and Ropes, The Clash and The Equals, which is this really good band from London.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>BG:</strong> Biggest musical influence?</p>\n<p><strong>RD:</strong> I never really planned on being a singer. It became an interesting road for me. I was in a bad accident when I was a kid. I was run over by a semi truck when I was 13, and I couldn’t be as active. My mom played music in the house while I was in bed and I asked her to teach me. I was also a horrendous singer for a really long time. Eventually singing became a therapy for me. It just feels good.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>BG:</strong> Favorite place to perform?</p>\n<p><strong>RD:</strong> Seattle. It’s become almost a second home to me. I’ve made so many great friends there, and every time I go it’s great.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>BG:</strong> Weird pre-show rituals?</p>\n<p><strong>RD:</strong> I do like weird vocal warm ups, or I’ll walk around in circles in the parking lot.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>BG:</strong> Something you wanted to do before music became more serious?</p>\n<p><strong>RD:</strong> Photography and anthropology and documentary filmmaking. I want to go back eventually and get my PhD once the music slows down.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Covered in tattoos, Ryan Davidson seems unassuming when you meet him, but he has a presence that’s unexplainable.

This week, Rita Silverman discusses the importance of Sherman Alexie’s <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> in today’s events while Addy Stupin takes on the surreal dystopia of Haruki Murakami’s <em>1Q84</em>. Submissions are solicited and edited by Phi Do.</p>\n<h2><strong>Rita Silverman on Sherman Alexie’s <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i></strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have entered an era of protests. We hold up signs in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and walk alongside the Women’s March to advocate for equal rights. Under our new president, I wonder if these protests can realistically yield anything. As an alternative, we turn to music, art and, specifically, literature to give us answers, hope and a little bit of comedic relief. Sherman Alexie has accomplished just that in his novel, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which gives a voice to the largely forgotten original people of America: Native Americans. It follows Junior, a 14-year-old Native American boy who lives in an Indian reservation where a cultural genocide is happening. He goes through life thinking the only people who </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deserve</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a good life and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a good life are white people. It then occurs to Junior that he must venture outside of the reservation by attending an all-white high school to prove that white people are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the only people who deserve a good life. Aside from racial injustices, the novel also focuses on a young boy trying to figure out his life with girls, bullies, friends and family — things we can all relate to. Moreover, the narration is a first-person voice from a pre-pubescent perspective, making it outrageously hilarious, unimaginably raw and honest. It was absolutely necessary to relieve all the anger and stress from current events. Alexie’s simple and witty writing allows us, as the audience, to realize that there is a racial injustice against Native Americans right in front of our eyes and we </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do something about it, starting with by addressing and acknowledging the injustice.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Addy Stupin on Haruki Murakami’s <i>1Q84</i></strong></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1Q84</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, written by renowned Japanese author Haruki Murakami and translated into English by Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel is, in a word, bizarre. It reads like a fever dream. Taking place in Japan in 1984 and switching between three points of view, a complex story is woven. The narrators of the novel include a dodgy but skilled private investigator, a cram school teacher who is also an aspiring writer and a fitness instructor with an unusual side job, all of whom share a past. At the heart of everything are the young teacher, Tengo, and the instructor, Aomame. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The novel itself follows the repercussions of an unusual book, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Air Chrysalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the brainchild of a beautiful young schoolgirl and ghostwritten by the aforementioned cram school teacher. The presence of two moons in the sky, a feature of the world imaged in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Air Chrysalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, hints at a bizarre alternative universe, which is coined “1Q84.” In this slightly-off universe, of which only a certain few are seemingly aware, a powerful cult works to eliminate those who have become aware of this new reality, namely Tengo and Aomame.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although an abstract connection, a parallel from George Orwell’s famed dystopia, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1984</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, can be drawn. 1Q84 exists as a separate entity outside of 1984 — a different version of that same year. Often, when society faces difficult times, writers react by fictionalizing darker worlds. Orwell’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1984</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an example of this technique. His creation of a society dictated by the all-encompassing “Big Brother,” was a response to the rising nationalism and competing ideologies leading to World War II. Murakami borrows directly from Orwell in terms of his title, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1Q84, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and also through the alternate interpretation of his novel and the greater message to be found if one reads in between the lines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While undeniably well written, the intricate and sometimes confusing narrative makes one wonder if the story is so surreal and well done that it is beyond comprehension or a bit clumsily composed at times. This book is a true page-turner and, although open-ended occurrences may be off-putting, the exceedingly well crafted work and interesting characters are undeniable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, sales of Orwell’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1984</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have spiked with the current American political state cited as the reason. Through the fantastical novel’s connections with Orwell’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1984</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, parallels can also be drawn to present day America, the flawed leadership and turmoil comparable, to some, to a sort of alternative universe. A character in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1Q84</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a controversial cult leader with an avid following and unhealthy amount of control,

“Chromatica.” After the country and folk-influenced “Joanne,” fans were hungry for Gaga’s return to culture-defining electro-pop songs. She delivers with this record, producing a collection of 13 songs with three interludes that are pure pop, all with clean instrumentals and some of Gaga’s finest songwriting to date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the album’s strengths, the road to release was one of the clunkiest I’ve ever seen for an A-list artist. After the lead single “Stupid Love” leaked, it was released in late February with no additional changes. The release date for “Chromatica” was initially set for April 10, but it was pushed back to May 29 due to coronavirus concerns, which she addressed in an </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-H1QjNlwyx/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emotional Instagram note</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Soon after, </span><a href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/2079270/lady-gaga-chromatica-album-cover-leak/news/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the cover art leaked in full</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, forcing her to reveal it earlier. When all the destruction seemed to be done, </span><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-chromatica-tracklist-target-leaked.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Target accidentally released the tracklist</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when it stocked the album for pre-release on its website. Snippets for songs like “Babylon,” “Rain On Me,” and “Free Woman” all leaked and, instead of capitalizing on this momentum, Gaga’s team did not release a second single until a week before the album. Even the setbacks couldn’t stop one of pop’s most influential faces, and the album was released last week to </span><a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/music/chromatica/lady-gaga?ref=hp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">critical praise</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lead single “Stupid Love” is pure guilty-pleasure music, and is an </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/lady-gaga-stupid-love-review-glorious-pop-yearning/607207/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">immediate return to the pop that she’s known and loved for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With an ‘80s flair and a thumping beat, the track left fans needing more of the same from the rest of the album. Interestingly, “Stupid Love” is probably the most unique of the album; the song’s light and airy backdrop is a standout against the dark, instrumental-heavy tracks.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second single, “Rain On Me,” features pop superstar Ariana Grande and is altogether a dynamo of a song, one that gets more fun every time I listen to it. The song is about persevering through hard moments, and despite wishing for them to be over, remaining strong in the face of adversity. “I’d rather be dry, but at least I’m alive/Rain on me, rain rain,” she sings. The video is an instant classic, featuring Gaga and Grande drenched in rain, dancing through it all with various wardrobe changes and futuristic sets. Whereas “Stupid Love” seemed campy and costume-like, “Rain On Me” is professional and, while still silly and fun, very well produced for artists of such high caliber.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that “Sour Candy,” a collaboration with South Korea’s most recognizable girl group BLACKPINK, would be a good song if you listened to it with your brain turned off. The catchy house instrumental borrows the same sample that Katy Perry’s “Swish Swish” did, but some of the lyrics fall apart. Admittedly, “I’m sour candy/So sweet then I get a little angry” is a clever line, but there aren’t enough good ideas on the song to back it up. The BLACKPINK members deliver as good of a job as they can on a five-person 2-and-a-half-minute song, especially when delivering lines as cutting as “Ask me to be nice, and then I’ll do it extra mean.” No matter your opinion on K-pop or </span><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/kpop-twitter-fancam-reply-trend/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how its fans act on Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this genre has leaped into the Western cultural sphere, and a feature on a Lady Gaga song solidifies its relevance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The previously mentioned “Babylon,” with an </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCM2lWePOnw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">irresistible punchy instrumental from a “Haus Labs” promotional video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, had leaked, but the album version is different. This rendition includes pianos, saxophones and a full-blown choir in the chorus, joining Gaga in chanting “Strut it out, walk a mile/Serve it, ancient city style,” reminiscent of the command-like lyrics and beat from Madonna’s “Vogue.” As one enlightened YouTube comment once told me, “You know a Gaga song is good when Madonna fans start to compare the two.” I’ll be honest, I had a hard time subscribing to the idea of the semi-forced wordplay “Gossip, babble on/Battle for your life, Babylon,” but after hearing how good the whole song is, I’ve accepted that it only adds to Gaga’s path of not taking herself or her music too seriously.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_94797\" style=\"width: 691px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1569868359\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94795\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-94797\" data-attachment-id=\"94797\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/welcome-to-chromatica-lady-gaga-returns-to-her-pop-homeland/lady-gaga-beats1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?fit=681%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"681,383\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"lady-gaga-beats1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?fit=681%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-94797\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?resize=681%2C383\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?w=681&amp;ssl=1 681w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lady-gaga-beats1.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-94797\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Variety</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three interludes on the album do little more than to shorten the length of it, which is already small (43 minutes for a 16-track album), even though the transition from “Chromatica” to “911” is, in a word, excellent. They do provide a nicely produced sonic palate cleanser between all of the pop explosiveness and separate some of the lyrical ideas from each other. However, my general rule regarding interludes is that if you are not </span><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14271-the-archandroid/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janelle Monáe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and able to execute them flawlessly, you should not do them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particularly heavy hitter is “Free Woman,” which is about how Gaga was sexually assaulted by a music producer early in her career. She felt free after she let go of the pain and was able to celebrate, and she sings, “I’m not nothing without a steady hand/I’m not nothing unless I know I can/I’m still something if I don’t got a man/I’m a free woman, oh-oh.” This song is a triumphant return to Gaga’s dance roots, which is most clearly shown through the upbeat dance production and stand-out lyric, “This is my dance floor I fought for.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another standout is “Plastic Doll,” a song about conforming to the music industry and being what everyone looks for in a pop star. It’s not a particularly new idea, but Gaga sells it with the strained and pleading lines, “Don’t play with me/It just hurts me.” The over-enunciated (to the point where it’s funny) bridge “Tell me, who dressed you? Where’d you get that hat? Why is she crying? What’s the price tag?/Who’s that girl, Malibu Gaga?/Looks so sad, what is this saga?” takes away from the tension in the song, but cements that Dramatic Gaga is probably the best Gaga.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the album is so pop heavy, something it suffers from is homogeneity, with each song following a pretty similar structure: an instrumental chorus and a reboot of it with added vocals at the end. It can make for a pretty disorienting listen, and some sufferers include “Alice” and “911.” At least on the latter, Gaga tackles some issues regarding the self and fame, leading to interesting lines like “Holdin’ on so tight to this status/It’s not real but I’ll try to grab it/Keep myself in beautiful places/Paradise is in my hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not a show-stopping album, but it’s a handful of pop songs with interesting writing about Gaga’s career, personal life, substance use and relationships, along with strong, dynamic instrumental production to back it up. This dance-central album might just provide enough refuge with a bedroom dance party to make us forget we can’t listen to this music at a real party.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Album rating: 7/10</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72a4b221809bf145adbdde6c035079b7?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sfranzini/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sam Franzini</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sam Franzini is a second year student and a fan of dogs, music, tennis, stationery, and <em>Survivor</em>.
