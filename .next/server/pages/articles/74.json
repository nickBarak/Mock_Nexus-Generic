The 49ers swept Cal Poly last weekend and they have won four of their last six games. The Gauchos have also won four of their last six games.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s improved pitching has been the story of late, as the staff held UC Riverside to just two runs in each of its victories this past weekend. This improvement is monumental for a team that boasts a combined 5.30 ERA this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos may be able to continue their success on the mound this weekend as Long Beach State has struggled at the plate. The team’s combined batting average is just .273 this season and they have only three players hitting above .300.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State is led by sophomore infielder Lauren Lombardi. Lombardi is hitting .338 on the season and has nine home runs. She also has a staggering 50 RBI and sports a .600 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>UCSB will bring a host of power hitters to this series. Junior catcher MeShalon Moore remains on fire for the Gauchos as she is hitting .356 in conference play this season and has four home runs. Moore is hitting .346 on the season with 40 RBI.</p>\n<p>Wisdom also always brings the threat of power to the plate, as she leads the team with nine home runs this season and holds a .586 slugging percentage. She also has tallied two triples and posts an on base percentage of .346.</p>\n<p>In addition to Moore and Wisdom, sophomore outfielders Kristen Clark and Jacqueline Hinojosa are always threats to get on base. Clark leads the team with a .370 batting average and she remains a constant danger on the base paths with nine stolen bases this season.</p>\n<p>“You have to keep things simple [at the plate],” Clark said. “Relax and just keep doing whatever it takes to get on base.”</p>\n<p>Hinojosa is second on the team with a .366 batting average. She leads the teams with 27 walks this season, which has helped her achieve an impressive on base percentage of .485. Hinojosa has also scored 26 runs thus far.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to take full advantage of Long Beach State’s susceptible pitching staff. Sophomore Christina Clermont leads the team with a 2.30 ERA this season and has a record of 18-7. Opponents are hitting just .203 against Clermont.</p>\n<p>Overall however, Long Beach State has a team ERA of 3.52 and opponents are averaging a healthy .262 against their pitchers. The team has also given up a total of 43 home runs this season.</p>\n<p>The first pitch will be on Friday at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 7, 2015’s

The Spartans began the year on a road trip where they won the first game and dropped the second one. The Spartans’ last two games have been postponed and they have not played in a tennis meet since Jan. 24.</p>\n<p>Despite the small sample size currently shown by the Spartans, their team is comprised of some talented players. In the singles rankings, SJSU has No. 96 junior Sybille Gauvain who has the capability to defeat higher nationally ranked players than her, as shown in her record against top 100 players last fall. The San Jose State Spartans also have the nationally ranked tandem of freshman Tamara Culibrk and sophomore Miyo Kobayashi who are ranked No. 41 in the ITA Doubles Rankings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos matchup well with the Spartans as their talent in doubles and singles play is something that gives them a chance to pick up their first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Junior Palina Dubavets and senior Stefani Stojic came away with losses in both singles and doubles play in last weekend’s game against UCLA, but the upcoming game against SJSU could be a perfect opportunity for the pair to rebound with victories in both categories of play.</p>\n<p>The Arizona Wildcats have been perfect so far this season. The Wildcats have played all of their five games at home and have won every single meet. Paving the way for the Wildcats’ success is their talented singles play made up of nationally ranked No. 18 senior Lauren Marker and No. 89 senior Samantha Czarniak.</p>\n<p>The talented seniors have not lost a singles match all season as they have either won their matches or the games were left unfinished. Marker and Czarniak are also doubles partners, and while they have not been as successful in doubles play as they have been in singles play, the duo remains a formidable opponent.</p>\n<p>The Wildcats will be playing only their second away game when they square off against UCSB, a new dynamic that could present a problem for Arizona as they look to remain perfect. UCSB’s return back home after a long road trip could also help fuel the Gauchos in their quest for their first victory of the season.</p>\n<p>Matchup-wise, the Gauchos don’t have the nationally ranked singles players that the Wildcats do, but that shouldn’t be a knock on the capability of UCSB in singles play as they have their own stable of talented singles players. In doubles play, Santa Barbara’s nationally ranked pair of No. 33 senior Melissa Baker and sophomore Stephanie Yamada have enjoyed wins in two of the Gauchos last games. The latest winning streak for the duo looks to be a positive building block as UCSB looks to secure their first doubles match point since their game against Texas Tech University on Jan. 28. The Gauchos hope that the success of Baker and Yamada can combine with a doubles victory from Dubavets and Stojic to clinch the doubles point in their match against Arizona.</p>\n<p>In doubles play, Santa Barbara’s nationally ranked pair of No. 33 senior Melissa Baker and sophomore Stephanie Yamada have enjoyed wins in two of the Gauchos last games.</p>\n<p>The latest winning streak for the duo looks to be a positive building block as UCSB looks to secure their first doubles match point since their game against Texas Tech University on Jan. 28.

great in both of the exhibition games prior to Friday. The LA Galaxy product is a promising prospect for UCSB, giving the team some speed and goalscoring ability in the backline. He started off playing great against the Rebels however in the 8th minute he contested a ball in the air and awkwardly landed on his ankle when he came down. This took him out of the game, and could hold him out for an extended period of time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His injury sucked the life out of the Gauchos early in the game, but their defense held strong for most of the first half. The Rebels had their best goalscoring opportunity in the 44th minute when junior midfielder Marcos Gonzalez rocketed a shot off the post, and the Gauchos actually went into halftime leading 55-45 in possession even though they hadn’t played their best soccer yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB came running out of the gates for the second half, and in the 47th minute looked to have their first goal of the regular season when forward Rodney Michael sent a perfect chip to a wide-open Thibault Candia in the box. Candia was one-on-one with goalkeeper Enrique Adame, yet the midfielder whiffed on the volley leading to an easy save.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inability to convert in the final third was a concerning theme for the Gauchos for the first 87 minutes. There were three plays in the first ten minutes of the second half alone where UCSB had the ball in the box with a clean look that they couldn’t put in the back of the net, and although chemistry and sharpness will surely improve as the season goes on, the team really can’t afford to keep missing opportunities if they want to win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second major roadblock for the Gauchos came in the 54th minute when senior defender Faouzi Taieb left the game with an apparent hamstring injury. Taieb is a key player both on offense and defense for UCSB, and with him out for the next few games the team will have to put that much more effort in on both ends to keep things running smoothly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the game wore on and injuries piled up for the Gauchos there was a huge momentum swing in favor of the Rebels. Starting in the 63rd minute UNLV had an almost 20-minute stretch of straight up pressure on the UCSB defense, until the 80th minute when freshman Hayden Prasad curled in a cross which forward Bryan Martinez-Serrano headed home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal was a wake-up call for the Gauchos, and they turned on the jets themselves, eventually leading to an Ignacio Tellechea strike in the 87th minute past the Rebels goalkeeper’s outstretched arms to send the game into overtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB almost put the game away in the first four minutes of OT when junior transfer Ameyawu Muntari was brought down in the box, however Michael sent the penalty kick that they were awarded soaring over the bar. Finally with just three minutes left in the second overtime period, forward Will Baynham got to play hero for the Gauchos when he knocked in a loose ball in the box to give them the 2-1 victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a quick 48 hour turn-around for the Gauchos as they had to face off against a tough Virginia Tech team on Sunday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB struck first in this game in the 4th minute when Muntari took the ball down the left wing and sent a cross in that took a slight deflection off of a Hokie defender and found the back of the net. The Ghanian transfer from Santa Barbara City College has been a pleasant surprise early on this season, using his speed and technical ability with both feet to create a ton of opportunities on offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was all downhill from there for the Gauchos however, as Virginia Tech would go on to score three unanswered goals to win the game 3-1. Senior Jon Ingason would be the one to open up the scoring for the Hokies in the 7th minute as he struck a free kick from 25 yards out into the upper right corner of the goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second goal would come in the 65th minute when senior forward James Kasak, who just terrorized the depleted Gauchos backline all game long, crossed the ball into the box and UCSB defender Hunter Ashworth’s attempted clearance rocketed into the back of the net for an own goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the last goal for the Hokies in the 74th minute, a tap-in by forward Jacob Labovitz after a Ben Roach free-kick save, essentially put the game out of reach, the setup to the free kick actually had larger implications. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virginia Tech was awarded a free kick only because of a frustration foul by Ashworth after a verbal altercation with Hokie forward Brendan Moyers. The Gauchos have struggled with keeping a lid on their tempers before, but they really can’t afford to give up set-pieces and fouls out of anger, especially with Taieb out for the foreseeable future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although they let their emotions get the best of them on Sunday night, UCSB will look to get back on track this Saturday when they take on UC Berkeley at Harder Stadium.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

However, the Gaucho bats have been hot, and for this reason, the team cannot be counted out.</p>\n<p>UCSB is batting .307 as a team this season and averages 4.3 runs per game. The team also sports a .413 slugging percentage and has a combined 18 home runs.</p>\n<p>Of those 18 home runs, 12 have come off the bat of either senior utility player Shelby Wisdom or junior catcher MeShalon Moore. Wisdom has been on an absolute tear of late and leads the team with seven home runs and 28 RBI.</p>\n<p>Moore seems to do it all offensively, batting .355 with five home runs to her credit this season. She also leads the team with 27 runs and sits just behind Wisdom with a slugging percentage of .573.</p>\n<p>Also contributing to this hot offense are junior infielder Arianna Palomares and sophomore outfielder Kristen Clark.</p>\n<p>Palomares is hitting .380 this season with a team leading 13 doubles thus far, while Clark sports an average of .350 and leads the team with nine stolen bases.</p>\n<p>“I think the key has been to keep it simple,” Palomares said. “I just want to do my job for the team, and that really helps when I’m at the plate.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho pitching will look to rebound after giving up 17 runs this past weekend to Cal Poly. While UCSB still sports a high team ERA of 5.83, the pitching has improved of late and junior Ashley Ludlow has been stellar.</p>\n<p>Cal State Northridge comes in with a particularly dangerous offensive line-up with five hitters, who have played at least 40 games, hitting above .300.  They also have a team average of .314.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to pay particular attention to sophomore utility Katie Hooper who is hitting .365 and has launched 12 home runs this season. Hooper also leads the team with 43 RBI and a .722 slugging percentage.<br>\nCal State Northridge has struggled offensively in conference play, however. The team is only hitting .260 and has 36 strikeouts through six games.</p>\n<p>On the mound, freshman Zoe Conley and senior Brianna Elder have been dominant. Pitching 104.1 innings, Conley has an ERA of just 1.54 and averages 7.04 strikeouts per game.</p>\n<p>Elder has pitched 128.2 innings and has an ERA of 2.01. She also averages 7.62 strikeouts per game and has eight complete games to her credit this season. Elder and Conley have had no problem in conference play with a combined 1.64 ERA.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin the series this Saturday at Campus Diamond at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of April 9, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62211\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/santa-barbara-hosts-red-hot-matadors-squad/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62211\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/santa-barbara-hosts-red-hot-matadors-squad/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/santa-barbara-hosts-red-hot-matadors-squad/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/santa-barbara-hosts-red-hot-matadors-squad/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/santa-barbara-hosts-red-hot-matadors-squad/","id":73,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[72,71,70],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
