The compilation stretches only as far as the last 12 months, but its 19 featured artists represent a sizable snapshot of what grooves the little studio under Storke Tower.</p>\n<p>The project was spearheaded by Guo, who has always dreamt of doing a compilation album to document the going ons of KCSB. Although the streaks of blue in her hair create the effect of a blissed-out mermaid, Guo is a powerhouse when it comes to getting stuff done. She spent the better part of the last four months contacting the musicians and okay-ing their contribution to the CD, a job that took an absurd amount of back and forth emailing and persuasion.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>During her role as program director last year, Guo formed a dynamic duo with fellow program director Bennett Piscitelli and the two created a show in the Friday noon spot, “Future Daze.” The goal of the show was to present the new music that KCSB constantly comes into contact with. “It’s always like Christmas at KCSB – we are always getting new CDs and vinyl,” said Guo.</p>\n<p>Through “Future Daze,” Guo and Piscitelli were able to showcase new music that they found on CDs mailed to the KCSB office. “We’d play CDs that we liked, review them and talk about them. We also contacted people through promoters – we had so many live bands coming through for that show,” she said.</p>\n<p>Some of these live performers included New Zealander indie rock group Streets of Laredo, L.A. funk masters Evolfo, and most notably, Brazilian singer-songwriter Rodrigo Amarante. Each of these musicians secured a spot onto the compilation.</p>\n<p>“Bennett [Piscitelli] and I met Streets of Laredo at a venue in lower east side New York. We walked down these steps to this huge showcase of New Zealand talent. One of the members of the band – this tall guy with a big beard – was handing out CDs so we took one and got his card,” said Guo. “That night I popped the CD into my laptop,” and the blue-haired lady loved them.</p>\n<p>Later, the dynamic duo got in contact with the group back in Santa Barbara, and few a months later the kiwi band came to the West Coast for the first time and played in Studio A. There were seven of them with keys, guitars and various other instruments, and the small space of the studio bled with intimacy throughout the set.</p>\n<p>Streets of Laredo’s bit marks the second track on the album. “Hey Rose” is a gorgeous indie rock tune following similar undertones of the Lumineers and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. The harmonies meld wonderfully while the tambourine lends a nice shakeup towards the end of the track.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/zMwCmio2jCUframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zMwCmio2jCU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>Evolfo was another of Guo’s favorites. “The lead singer of the band was really good friends with the general manager from three years ago, the general manager when I first got involved in KCSB,” Guo said. “One day he sent me a message on Facebook that Evolfo was gonna be in the area and he sent me a YouTube video. It was great! So we set it up the next day.”</p>\n<p>But live sessions don’t usually get set up that quick. One artist in particular, Rodrigo Amarante, was on Guo’s radar for months before she braved sending emails to his publicist. “I’ve liked his music since freshmen year of high school, when I first since I heard Little Joy, one of his projects with Fabrizio Moretti from The Strokes. I was just like, wow this guy has such a wonderful voice,” she said.</p>\n<p>Piscitelli, whom Guo affectionately refers to as the “more chill one” in their partnership, urged her to contact Amarante’s people all year. She finally rid herself of inhibitions and sent the email. A couple weeks later, Rodrigo Amarante showed up at Studio A.</p>\n<p>“He called me on my phone, saying he was in the parking lot and coming to KCSB, and I couldn’t even believe it,” said Guo.</p>\n<p>The meeting with Amarante happened mid-July, and it was an especially beautiful performance because it was the first gig that Guo and Piscitelli worked on together since the latter’s graduation in June.</p>\n<p>“Rodrigo Amarante – that was really something,” Guo said, annunciating the “che” sound in the famed singer’s last name. “It was mine and Bennett’s [Piscitelli] comeback to the airwaves.” It was their last time on “Future Daze.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/4i7NB51rPkYframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/4i7NB51rPkY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>Nowadays, “Future Daze” is manned by the current program directors, and between that show and SBDIY founder Josh Redman’s “5…4…3…2…fun!!” program, loads of musicians are rolling into Studio A. <em>Live in Studio A</em> is a testament to the great tunes and closeness that forms within the cramped hexagonal walls.</p>\n<p>“Listening to the CD, so many feelings come back,” said Guo. “They were playing and I was standing in the middle, the middle of the band. I was doing this three sixty [camera] shot and they were all standing around me. It was just – awesome. You’re in this music landscape, but it’s a different kind of dimension that you’re involved in.”</p>\n<p>That different kind of dimension is the beauty of Studio A.<em> </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Live in Studio A is being released as a present for donors of KCSB’S Fund Drive, happening until Friday, Nov. 21.

The Dead Winter Carpenters were finishing up their opening set for Greensky Bluegrass at the Troubadour, one of L.A.’s best small venues. Virtuosic fiddling and an intricate breakdown that veered close to rock brought the performance to a close, and the band quickly broke down their equipment in preparation for the headliner.</p>\n<p>I’d been introduced to bluegrass at High Sierra Music Festival this summer, where I stumbled upon the last 20 minutes of Greensky’s set. The band crosses the line between entertainment and time travel, transporting listeners to a whole other sort of America. This music speaks of the hills and forests of Appalachia. In this reporter’s humble opinion, it’s as sacred as the ritual drum circles of the Sahara and the chants of the Medieval Ages. At least, that’s where the best groups take it. Greensky is, without a doubt, firmly within the ranks of these champions. Their instrumentals flow like babbling brooks and tell stories more powerful than any lyrics ever could — although their lyrics make a fine effort. Greensky’s live setup includes no drums and no electric instrument. A banjo, mandolin, guitar, slide guitar and a variation of the standup bass combine in frantic fashion and build crazy energy. While certain instruments, notably the mandolin, played a very significant role, the band stood in a half-circle, emphasizing the collaborative equality of the jam.</p>\n<p>And jam they did. From tracks like “Windtree” to seemingly spontaneous voyages into psychedelic and funky territory — that’s right, an all-acoustic bluegrass band got funky for 10 minutes before seamlessly transitioning into Hendrix — the group displayed pure virtuosity over and over and over.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After about an hour, they left for a 15 minute intermission. During this time, the crowd, which had a pretty diverse age range, went outside for a much-needed breather. Lying just outside of Beverly Hills, the Troubadour has hosted more than its fair share of legends. It’s an extremely well-managed outfit, complete with a bar and restaurant. The sound system shames that of any other club its size, with massive cabinets delivering crisp and clear notes. Throughout the night, the sound technician darted through the crowd with iPad in hand to make adjustments on the go. I was impressed.</p>\n<p>Greensky took the stage once more and played straight through ‘til midnight, bringing the performance to almost three hours total. They stayed away from funk during this half, choosing to cover Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing in the Dark” instead. The crowd loved it, and bodies were moving the whole night through. By the end, I was convinced that no genre can beat bluegrass live. Nothing compares when it comes to pure skill. If white America has its own sacred music, bluegrass earns my vote.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/KVfX1qiZWEsframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/KVfX1qiZWEs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58370\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/greensky-bluegrass-transports-listeners-at-l-a-s-troubadour/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58370\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/greensky-bluegrass-transports-listeners-at-l-a-s-troubadour/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/greensky-bluegrass-transports-listeners-at-l-a-s-troubadour/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/greensky-bluegrass-transports-listeners-at-l-a-s-troubadour/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/greensky-bluegrass-transports-listeners-at-l-a-s-troubadour/","id":7026,"author":{"id":755,"name":"Adam De Gree"},"related":[7025,7024,7023],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mac DeMarco Turns Hub into Jungle Gym: Plus the Inside Scoop on the DeMarco After Party","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Tucked into a triangular nook of the hub’s ceiling beam, the gap-toothed indie-rocker grinned down at the crowd below him.

Screaming girls and sweaty boys stretched their hands and fingertips up towards the radical act, eyes sparkling in awe. Onstage, his band grooved through the now-electrified air while they watched their frontman slip out of sight, climbing up and over the railing onto the second floor of the Hub. Mac DeMarco was nowhere to be seen.\n<p>The crowd crept onto their tiptoes for the long minute that preceded DeMarco’s return to the stage, while wild hypotheses of what was to come next flooded their heads. DeMarco mysteriously reappeared on stage and gave his microphone a few pats. A slight raise of the eyebrows and a gentle shoulder shrug signaled that something was off — the microphone had been shut off. The crowd’s short exaltation was muted as they watched DeMarco proceed to be detained by the UCPD. </p>\n<p>A police officer forcefully grabbed him from behind, twisted his arm and pushed him off the stage. The Canadian singer’s mouth dropped and he turned his head around to look at his aggressor. After the initial shock wore off, DeMarco’s smile and eyes brightened and widened to form his classic crazy face, the one that glints with all the absurdity and humor of this world we live in. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before the showstoppers botched the merrymaking Mac DeMarco and his band took the stage around 10 p.m. They jammed through some favorite tunes including: “Ode to Viceroy,” “My Kind of Woman,” “Freaking out the Neighborhood,” “Blue Boy,” “Still Together,”  “Cooking up Something Good” and a gritty and hilariously overzealous cover of Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water.” The crowd pushed, swayed, moshed and sang along to every song. Sweat poured off audience members as they packed themselves together and got rowdier than Tasmanian devils to DeMarco’s sweeping blues-wave melodies. </p>\n<p>In between songs, the frontman casually prodded the audience in a sly tone, “So I’ve been told that there might be some kind of afterparty going on around here tonight, I heard you guys get into stuff like that?”  Loud jeers could be heard from a select few students that knew exactly what DeMarco was alluding to. I happened to be one of those cool cats in the know; he was going to be at a party at my neighbor’s house. My eyes lit up at the possibility of drinking a beer and smoking a Viceroy with the guy.</p>\n<p>After the mayhem, I immediately headed to I.V. Deli Mart to rehydrate my sweat-drenched body with a coconut water, and then was off to my next door neighbor’s house party to see if I could catch a moment with the outrageous artist.  I pushed open the large gate and saw the neon turquoise light of the pool refracting off the wooden fences and the eyes of the lucky party attendees. </p>\n<p>Sure enough, there he was, sitting in the corner of the spa with his girlfriend and drummer, sipping on a cold one and chain smoking away. I wondered if anything could wipe a smile off the man’s face as he chided with his bandmates and pushed out his belly to make himself look like a pregnant woman. One of the residents of the house, senior global studies major Jasmine Salvino, described DeMarco as, “Cool, calm and collected,” even when faced with the out-of-place comments of starstruck freshmen boys and girls. </p>\n<p>As the night wound down, I caught a few words with DeMarco after he exited the jacuzzi. DeMarco was relaxed and happy to have a place to chill after the dramatic ending at the Hub. I politely thanked him for playing the show and expressed my deep connection to his album 2, to which he was very grateful.</p>\n<p>“How did you define your sound over the years?  It’s very unique,” I asked. “I don’t know I guess I just put enough time in to make if feel right. Keep up the positive vibes you know?” he gleamed. I was curious as to how he could smoke so many cigarettes and still hold his voice together.He rolled his eyes, gazed at the ground for a moment and chuckled, looking back at me. “I don’t really, it’s very hard to keep,” he grinned. DeMarco’s drummer, Joe McMurray was standing nearby and eagerly interrupted the conversation. “But he’s got a heart of gold!” he said, leaning over with a grin. </p>\n<p>Amidst all of the laughter and amusement it was hard to discern between who had a more memorable night; the concertgoers or DeMarco and his band. From across the yard an unknown fan yelled out, “Hey, Mac, before I leave I have to say that that was my fifth show and this one was by far the coolest show I’ve seen you play by far! It was sick!” The kooky, gap-toothed smile grew again. “Yeah! It was a really fun gig!” Mac DeMarco said with delight as his imagination recounted all the anarchy of the night. </p>\n<p><em>Artsweek would like to offer a special thanks to UCPD for making Mac DeMarco and UCSB students look super PUNK ROCK and giving the community an unforgettable experience.</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58610\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSC_6418.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1271131852\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58607\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58610\" data-attachment-id=\"58610\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/mac-demarco-turns-hub-into-jungle-gym-plus-the-inside-scoop-on-the-demarco-after-party/dsc_6418/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSC_6418.jpg?fit=1200%2C798&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,798\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Eric Swenson\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416006652\",\"copyright\":\"Eric Swenson\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_6418\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSC_6418.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSC_6418.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSC_6418-1024x680.jpg?resize=888%2C590\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"590\" class=\"size-large wp-image-58610\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58610\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_58611\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CAM_7896.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"15364749\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58607\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58611\" data-attachment-id=\"58611\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/mac-demarco-turns-hub-into-jungle-gym-plus-the-inside-scoop-on-the-demarco-after-party/cam_7896/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CAM_7896.jpg?fit=1200%2C798&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,798\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416006678\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"62\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"CAM_7896\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CAM_7896.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CAM_7896.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CAM_7896-1024x680.jpg?resize=888%2C590\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"590\" class=\"size-large wp-image-58611\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58611\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Wait what did you say? Are black people even allowed to listen to that?” These were the frequent responses I got when I asked my hallmates in the black scholars hall about their knowledge of K-pop. K-pop (an abbreviation of Korean pop or Korean popular music) is a music genre consisting of electronic, hip-hop, pop, rock and R&amp;B music, which has its origins in South Korea. To the untrained eye, K-pop may appear as a fantastical music genre filled with bright colors, energetic dances and the biggest turnoff for most people: no English.</p>\n<p>Today, K-pop has become a “browser-hold” name through the power of social media and the insane popularity of Psy’s “Gangnam Style” garnering over a billion views on YouTube. With its ever-growing popularity a part of the “Hallyu-wave” in Korea, the influence of K-pop has spread out of the small country and found a strong audience in places such as other Asian countries, South America, Europe and even the United States. Though the spread of K-pop is commendable, the general audience still consists mainly of people of Asian descent, with some Caucasians and a growing number of African-Americans.</p>\n<p>For most African-American fans of K-pop, the genre’s hip-hop influences act as a gateway drug. K-pop fans that want to expose the genre to their friends typically introduce them to Korean hip-hop-influenced groups. With beats that resemble American hip-hop, the only hurdle for possible converts is the unfamiliar language. Of course, this does not apply to everyone. I sat down a few of my hallmates and showed them music videos that fit the Korean hip-hop fusion subgenre. On the wonderful panel of first-years, we had political science major Bakari Ziegler, film and media studies major Starr Sanford, anthropology major Kennedy Reason and biology majors Nicole Smovzh and Daionna Murray.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/wq7ftOZBy0Eframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/wq7ftOZBy0E\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>Rather than dipping one toe at a time with the first video, we plunged headfirst with what would be considered the epitome of the K-pop genre with the famed group Girls’ Generation and their hit single “I Got A Boy.” Predominately electronic-inspired, the song contains elements of both hip-hop and rap, with the group switching between song and rap. With this music video, I was met with comments like “Why are there so many colors?” and “They all look the same.”</p>\n<p>The video involves all nine members — yes, nine girls — putting on their cutest acts to impress a boy, while at the same time cutting to an aggressive and confident hip-hop inspired dance routine.</p>\n<p>“I like the dancing since it’s not the same thing throughout the video. Usually artists bring the same thing, like Beyoncé, but this offers a greater medley of things to see with each part,” Sanford said.</p>\n<p>A common female opinion was that these singers were rugged and tough when they were with each other, but as Smovzh observed, “As soon as a boy entered, they acted like basic bitches. That’s not cute. That’s not endearing. That’s ridiculous and just a dumb message to get across.”</p>\n<p>The next video was met with less groans and more interest on the girls’ part with the music video for “Growl” by EXO, the K-pop industry’s hottest newcomers. If the large band member number in the last video shocked my hallmates, nothing prepared them for the twelve boys that appeared on screen for this video. However, this video gray-scale edits starkly contrasted with the bright color scheme in “I Got A Boy”. My hallmates said that this allowed them to focus more on the music and the “amazing dancing.” Throughout the one-shot video, all twelve members exhibited their chorographical prowess, showing a mastery of intense moves as well as keeping a cool demeanor in the nonstop video. Again, this different form of performance was notable to Reason and Murray, who expressed that “they’re like One Direction, wait no, One Direction can’t dance” and “I have no clue what they’re saying, but, damn, they can dance.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/I3dezFzsNssframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/I3dezFzsNss\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>The last video received the most scrutiny and biggest reaction from my hallmates for the fact that this video drew the most influence from African-American hip-hop culture. The video for Taeyang’s song “Ringa Linga” features the singer clad in baggy pants, grills and faux cornrows while dancing and “spitting mad Korean bars.” To be clear, hip-hop music and culture have become an influential force all across the globe; Korean pop stars are hardly the only ones copying it.</p>\n<p>However, Ziegler, the only male that participated, argued “a K-pop star wanting to rap or dance like African-American artists is problematic because there isn’t a genuine desire to connect with black culture. Though they embrace this culture — our culture — their lyrics don’t mirror the culture of oppression and hardships.” And for this reason, the appropriation of black culture and all of western culture itself has become one of the main criticisms of the genre.</p>\n<p>Questions remain regarding K-pop’s potential for growth and influence. Will the scene be able to generate artists for the ages similar to the Beatles and Michael Jackson, who both moved from being teen idols to timeless international artists? Or will they continue to mimic their own superficial idea of western artists? While that remains to be seen, K-pop artists are certainly reaping the benefits of the genre’s current success. As for the black scholars hall’s unanimous final opinion, “the genre has room to grow, but has potential. They are all great performers, but they must find their own sound that others will strive to imitate.” Thus, in the black scholars hall, the budding genre has come a long way from being known as just “K-what.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/UJfZ69MSlvYframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UJfZ69MSlvY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58728\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/black-scholars-hall-reviews-k-pop/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58728\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/black-scholars-hall-reviews-k-pop/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/black-scholars-hall-reviews-k-pop/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/black-scholars-hall-reviews-k-pop/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/black-scholars-hall-reviews-k-pop/","id":7028,"author":{"id":751,"name":"Chinelo Ufondu"},"related":[7027,7026,7025],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
