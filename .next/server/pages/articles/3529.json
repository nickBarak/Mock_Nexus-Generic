If there was anyone to blame it’d probably be Adam Smith and capitalism.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit id=20177 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Housing-AN.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1208463956\" data-slb-group=\"31965\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Housing-AN-250x248.jpg?resize=250%2C248\" alt=\"\" title=\"Housing-AN\" width=\"250\" height=\"248\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31967\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>Finding and maintaining a suitable living situation is not a topic particular to I.V. — especially as a university student, living arrangements along most of the California coast can be competitive and costly.</p>\n<p>However, Isla Vista’s location, culture and large population may make it possible for conflicts between landlords and tenants to arise easily. The town is unruly, expensive and poorly maintained in many respects. In fact, at 62.5 people per acre, I.V. also has one of the highest concentrations of residents in California.</p>\n<p><strong>Students Want What They Want</strong></p>\n<p>“It’s the student’s desire to live in Isla Vista,” Associated Students attorney Robin Unander said. “I don’t care if it is UCSB, SBCC or student-age person; there is a lifestyle here. A certain demographic wants to be near, wants to be a part of it. That’s what drives it.”</p>\n<p>Currently, Isla Vista is populated 96 percent by renters, 45 to 50 percent of whom are students due to I.V.’s proximity to UCSB and SBCC. According to estimates from the UCSB Campus Housing Office and Santa Barbara City College Housing Services, close to 10,000 UCSB students and over 600 SBCC students indicated in Fall 2010 that they lived in I.V., although the total number of students in the area may be as high as 13,000.</p>\n<p>James Gelb, owner of Del Playa Rentals — the largest rental housing provider on Del Playa — said Isla Vista exists primarily as a renter’s market because so many students have flocked to the area for decades.</p>\n<p>According to Unander, there are only a few options available to student tenants who find fault with housing options in Isla Vista: they can move out of I.V. or live in university-owned residences, either on- or off-campus.</p>\n<p>“But then you can’t drink, can’t party,” Unander said. “A lot of students in I.V. want to be at least a little bit involved in that scene.”</p>\n<p>Those who stay in I.V., then, Unander said, will often have to struggle with tenuous living arrangements and hefty rent.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have a constitutional right to live wherever we want to live,” Unander said. “There are affordable places to live — you can go inland, Fresno, Bakersfield, etc.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, according to CHO Director Maya Salmon, there is no dearth of living space in I.V. High demand areas and not-so-high-demand areas, however see varied interest from renters.</p>\n<p>SBCC Housing advisor Amy Collins said I.V. can occasionally be less costly than living elswehere if students are willing to endure close quarters.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes the rent in I.V. can be cheaper than downtown cause you can have a bunch of people living together, although the quality of the I.V. house may be worse than the downtown property,” Collins said.</p>\n<p><strong>Do Landlords Push the Envelope?</strong></p>\n<p>Not everything is black and white when it comes to legal conflicts between landlords and tenants in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>In fact, in the majority of cases — sometimes due to grey areas of the law, other times due to student irresponsibility, Unander said — landlords are operating within their legal rights. However, some, she said, do truly have “no regard for tenant’s rights,” and take advantage of matters such as security deposit refunds, charges for repairs and student apathy.</p>\n<p>Gelb, who claims he spends hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on maintenance and upkeep for his rental properties, said some landlords in Isla Vista do the bare minimum to provide for their residents.</p>\n<p>“You’d be surprised how cheap people are,” Gelb said. “I’m not mentioning names, I would just simply state that there are some good ones and also some simply awful ones who aren’t trying to throw a dime into their place. Just like doctors, there are great ones and there are some that should be disbarred from their profession. “</p>\n<p>Some run-down I.V. properties for example, Gelb said, have aluminum window frames close to four decades old.</p>\n<p>“When owners don’t replace those windows, it becomes a real concern for female tenants worried about intruders,” Gelb said.</p>\n<p>But that’s hardly news — complaints about the ‘sketchiness’ of Isla Vista landlords are made regularly by students, often centering on disputes over damages, security deposits, maintenance requests and rent. However, according to Unander only rarely do students turn their frustrations into legal action.</p>\n<p>Unander, who has been assisting students with housing issues since she joined A.S. staff in 2003, said she has only seen about 25 students actually pursue their landlords in small claims court in her seven-plus years here.</p>\n<p>3rd District Supervisor Doreen Farr, whose office oversees Isla Vista, said many students express their discontent about Isla Vista housing to her.</p>\n<p>“Of course you have some negatives because so many people are living in small areas,” Farr said, “but one of the real frustrations is that I hear that a lot of Isla Vista housing situations are substandard.”</p>\n<p>Garrett Goto, a fourth-year hydrology major, said he has felt little effort from landlords to ensure a comfortable living situation.</p>\n<p>“I feel that landlords do the bare minimum to keep their properties in living condition,” Goto said in an e-mail. “[They] know that customers will continue to rent in I.V. regardless of how attentive or detailed they are.”</p>\n<p>Still, students are far from the best tenants. According to Unander, the fact that most students only live in I.V. for three to five years reduces their motivation to treat their residences as anything other than temporary, and hence, more disposable. As such, reckless behavior in I.V. often leads to hefty damages occurred against tenants.</p>\n<p>“There’s no ‘pride of ownership’ out here,” Unander said. “Students don’t really think about ‘wow I really want this place to look nice.’”</p>\n<p><strong>Protect Yourself</strong></p>\n<p>According to Gelb, renting in Isla Vista requires responsibility.</p>\n<p>“[When you lease], you’re entering into a contractual agreement with tenants,” Gelb said. “It’s called a relationship — it’s like getting married for one year.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Sauerbrun, a fourth-year computer science major at UCSB, is currently taking former I.V. rental management company Conquest to small claims court over the matter of $1300 in security deposits charges he alleges were billed to him in error. According to him, the best way to ensure safeguards against housing disputes is to only contact landlords via email, and take advantage of tenant’s services such as move-in videotaping.</p>\n<p>“Everyone gets screwed because some kids don’t take their living situations seriously,” Sauerbrun said. “You gotta stay vigilant and have everything on record.”</p>\n<p>Unander said more students should follow Sauerbrun’s example, and stand up for their rights as tenants.</p>\n<p>“That is part of my frustration in helping students doing things — they all get fired up but then there is just apathy,” Unander said. “[The irony is] that about 90 percent of those students who I have dealt with were successful in court or negotiated with their landlord before court.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31965\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/housing-trap/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31965\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/housing-trap/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/housing-trap/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/housing-trap/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-20/housing-trap/","id":3529,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[3528,3527,3526],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld","biography":"Not available","articles":[2122,2138,2149,2167,2259,2288,2298,2299,2381,2765,2788,2794,2862,2892,3000,3128,3161,3529,3534],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Excuse me, Mr. Regent, sir…","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Our editorial board is publishing this statement to the Regents in hopes of getting an important message through their thick skulls: California’s youth is barely able to attend the UC at present fee...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Our editorial board is publishing this statement to the Regents in hopes of getting an important message through their thick skulls: California’s youth is barely able to attend the UC at present fee levels.</p>\n<p>“Who cares?” You may say to yourself. “That’s been the case for the last two decades.”</p>\n<p>As part of the UC we challenge you to go beyond. Don’t sit-back — reform is a participation sport, and you’re up to bat.</p>\n<p>We have entered an age where a student who wants an affordable education is considered an extremist.  Next generation’s UC students will pay more than their predecessors for less of an education than the system has ever offered. While the Regents of the University of California and their police cohorts might say that UC students are rebellious gits with no respect for bureaucratic procedure, they have criminalized our inherent right to learn and better ourselves through schooling.</p>\n<p>Our campaign for education was never a radical request. In their fight for the right to education, California’s youth has never asked for more than they were entitled. </p>\n<p>However, to our dismay, the practice of denial and scapegoating has become a staple of behavior from UC leadership.</p>\n<p>We find it absolutely imperative to remind the Regents that the UC is a public institution, and that its mission is to provide an affordable quality education to those who qualify. The Regents have thus far failed in their pledge to adhere to the California Master Plan and support California students as well as uphold their right to an affordable, equal higher education decades ago.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, students braved brandished weapons and pepper spray in a commendable but likely futile effort to return balanced decision-making to the UC.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in modern times, our students are persecuted, pepper-sprayed and taunted with handguns whenever they voice their discontent.</p>\n<p>At yesterday’s meeting, a police officer pulled a pistol on student protesters. While circumstances are still unclear, the fact of the matter is that a UC police officer pointed a deadly weapon at unarmed students whose only request was to be offered an affordable education.</p>\n<p>Although police presence was requested in the case the protest went awry, yesterday’s violence between law enforcement and students is indicative of a larger desperation that has now enveloped the entire UC system.</p>\n<p>Not only did last year’s 32 percent fee increases break the bank, but Mark Yudof now proposes to add an additional eight percent to that number and raise the total cost of a public education in California to an unprecedented 40 percent over the last two years.</p>\n<p>How far can our pockets stretch? How long can UC executives reach into them to pay for the state’s fiscal mismanagement?</p>\n<p>We understand that money is scarce and times are hard — not just for the UC, but for the nation as a whole. However, this does not excuse a lack of UC investment into the classroom. We are the next generation, and we demand the same access to public education that was given to the generations before us.</p>\n<p>The Board of Regents has consistently passed responsibility for this injustice onto the state, declaring their hands and tongues tied in addressing the matter. But denial can only go so far.</p>\n<p>We have some words for the UC executives who have failed to take the students’ interests into account: take responsibility for your failure to represent us in this economic crisis. Take responsibility for the overwhelmed parents and students, the poorly paid professors, the underfunded programs, the lack of campus resources and the packed classrooms. Recognize that you are indeed the upper echelon of a decision-making process that trickles down into real world consequences for all the students you pledged to serve when you took your position. Realize your potential to change the situation for the better and to ease the sting of the recession for California citizens who deserve an education.</p>\n<p>Students: realize your responsibility to ensure that this change happens. Keep your elected representatives honest, both for your sake and the sake of subsequent generations. Silence is consent in this case, and unless you are enthusiastic about forking over more of your money to the UC Regents, we suggest you speak up.</p>\n<p>Yesterday’s protest was a wake-up call. It serves to remind us of the risks our peers are willing to take to ensure our right to an accessible education is still existent. The risks, consequences and future of a declining and unaffordable UC system are real.</p>\n<p>We are delusional to appreciate the efforts of our UC leadership. Students have every reason to believe that we have been forsaken. The UC was once recognized as an accessible path to higher education; it was once considered an affordable option for a world-class education. Now, elitist values and exclusionary prices ensure that this education is only extended to the rich.</p>\n<p>The UC Board of Regents has failed you. It’s time to take matters into our own hands.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30176\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30176\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-18/excuse-regent-sir/","id":3526,"author":{"id":59,"name":"Daily Nexus Staff"},"related":[3525,3524,3523],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vendors Gather to Showcase Innovations","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over 140,000 techies descended on the Las Vegas Convention Center from Wed. to Sun. last week for the Consumer Electronics Show, a number made all the more staggering by the fact that the show isn’t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over 140,000 techies descended on the Las Vegas Convention Center from Wed. to Sun. last week for the Consumer Electronics Show, a number made all the more staggering by the fact that the show isn’t even open to the general public.</p>\n<p>Held annually in Las Vegas, the showcase hosts tech companies from across the globe for a display of their latest electronic innovations, ranging from robotics to refrigerators. Every year, tech giants such as Intel and Microsoft, along with companies such as Panasonic and LG spend tens of thousands on setting up elaborate booths, some spanning multiple floors, to display their latest products and innovations. Also alongside these huge companies are hordes of smaller booths, some rented by individual entrepreneurs to promote their inventions, some manned by young companies trying to break into a niche market, but the largest amount are staffed by vendors promoting the dull but essential elements of the electronics industry, such as cables and batteries.  However, most vendors boasted an array of gadgets that fell somewhere between the commonplace and the outrageous.</p>\n<p>Household names such as Skype, Taser, iRobot (manufacturers of the Roomba), Polaroid and many others made up a bulk of the show, showcasing one or two new products or services rather than partaking in the showmanship war that the larger companies seem trapped in.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If this year’s CES had a theme, it was certainly 3D.  Every company that could show off a 3D TV was, from the over-the-top wall mounted TV displays of Panasonic and LG to the more low-key offerings of Sharp and others, it was almost easy to forget these companies had ever made anything else.</p>\n<p>In the case of LG, there was a comical dichotomy between the energy and grandeur that went into showing off their latest TVs and the rest of their products.  Attendees lined up to don 3D glasses and view elaborate displays while workers scrambled to answer questions and show off the new devices.  Opposite the TVs was the other part of the LG booth, showcasing their newest refrigerator. With one lonely employee in front of an austere display, there was almost a feeling that LG itself had chosen to forget about their other product lines in favor of showcasing 3D technology.</p>\n<p>In addition to the 3D TVs themselves, other companies rode the 3D wave with products such as designer 3D glasses to be worn over regular glasses and other 3D TV accessories including stereos and more.  Companies such as Canon and Sony also focused on their 3D camera offerings, trying to prove that 3D was not just for Hollywood or big TV studios, but also for your home movies and vacation photos.</p>\n<p>One of the most impressive 3D offerings that the show had was the technology to watch 3D without having to use glasses.  A few companies demonstrated familiar movies such as “Avatar” on these experimental displays.  While the technology is still somewhat rough — for example, the screens can only be properly viewed from a certain distance and height — the quality that these prototypes showed was impressive.  If you were to sit in the proper place, they achieved an effect somewhere between regular 2D television and full quality 3D. While the technology still has room to grow, it’s definitely something worth keeping an eye on.</p>\n<p>The show also featured the newest in experimental design and integrated technology from auto manufactures such as Audi, Tesla, GM and Ford.</p>\n<p>Audi showed off very slick displays they had integrated into the dash of their newest vehicles, capable of projecting information onto the windshield for a driver to view information without looking away from the road.  GM also brought their newest prototypes to Las Vegas: cars that can drive themselves and network with each other to form automated caravans that all follow a leader car.</p>\n<p>On top of everything else, CES had robots crawling all over the place, varying from a little device that cleaned windows by crawling up and down both sides of glass panes, to aquatic military drones.  iRobot showed off their newest devices, including a pool-cleaning robot and a nursing home robot that would provide automated care for residents.  This year saw a much larger focus on robotics than in previous years, with booths devoted both to individual components and finished demonstrations, such as a small robot that balanced on and rode a bike around stage.  Typically many of the smaller robotics offerings are not in the main hall, and it was interesting to see them closer to center stage this year.</p>\n<p>CES was, as usual, chaotic, crowded and impressive.  Attendees took over Las Vegas for the weekend, making it impossible to go anywhere without seeing a sea of CES badges and suits.  Staggeringly large, the show is a great example of the industry as a whole, and this year the show was bigger, more crowded and flashier than the last few years.  Also worth noting was the large percentage of Chinese vendors at the show, not just showing off components in small booths, but exhibiting finished products such as TVs and laptops that were sleek, cheap and ready to compete in the global market. In keeping with annual tradition, the show offered a smorgasbord of the latest, greatest products, impressive innovations and the promise to tempt electronics consumers in 2011.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><em><strong>Best In Show</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><strong>Ford Focus EV</strong><br>\nFord premiered their first fully electric vehicle in their keynote on Saturday morning.  With a range of around 100 miles on a charge, and the ability to charge in standard 120v or 240v outlets, Ford has managed to take the practicality of the Focus to an even higher level.   Overall it’s an impressive vehicle, and Ford is looking at a release in the US sometime this year, with European releases in 2013.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Polaroid</strong><br>\nPolaroid premiered two interesting products, a camera being designed by Lady Gaga as part of a product line known as Gray Line, and a slightly less flashy portable photo printer with Bluetooth connectivity.  The camera has a real retro appearance, but with a beautiful screen and Polaroid’s iconic instant photos — now using an inkless technology called zink that prevents smudging and keeps the film small — it’s sure to find a market among enthusiasts.  The printer is marketed as a way to print photos from cellphones instantly without any computer, and unlike the camera, will be hitting shelves sometime this year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Taser Demonstration</strong><br>\nTaser’s products were basically what you would expect: self-defense devices that fire electrified probes to disable potential attackers.  Despite some variation in color and shape, Taser’s products stayed true to their roots.  However, the Taser booth will remain one of the most memorable of the show because they allowed attendees to volunteer to be tased as live demonstrations.  There are few more ringing endorsements for your product as a self-defense tool then watching a man groan to his feet and answer “How do you feel?” with “like s^*t” over the booth’s sound system.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-12/vendors-gather-showcase-innovations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-12/vendors-gather-showcase-innovations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-12/vendors-gather-showcase-innovations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-12/vendors-gather-showcase-innovations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-12/vendors-gather-showcase-innovations/","id":3527,"author":{"id":217,"name":"Derek Palmer"},"related":[3526,3525,3524],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Balancing Act: Working Mothers at UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Laurel Wilder is the assistant director of Institutional Research & Planning at UCSB.

However, women at UCSB, especially those seeking tenured positions in the sciences, find that balancing children and a career can be a nearly impossible road to travel.</p>\n<p>Only seven of the top 100 paid employees at UCSB last year were women, and four of them work in the sciences, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. These male-dominated departments traditionally pay the most at UCSB, as they receive the most grants and other funding.</p>\n<p>Many think that women are less involved in these departments due to a lack of interest. But for the past three decades, the United States has made a concerted effort to attract women to the sciences and other competitive fields. Today, women earn over 50 percent of all Ph.D.s, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>However, a 2009 study of the UC system by UC Berkeley and the Center for American Progress showed that women do not often attain academic research positions in STEM and, when they do, are more likely to quit before obtaining tenure.</p>\n<p>Findings showed that family formation accounts for the “largest leaks in the pipeline.” Women in the sciences who are married with children are 35 percent less likely to enter a tenure track job after receiving a Ph.D. than their male counterparts.</p>\n<p>Single women without children are, on average, as successful as married men with children in attaining a tenure track position.</p>\n<p>According to Eileen Boris, feminist studies professor and hull chair, motherhood and the demands of STEM are often incompatible.</p>\n<p>“Women have not been encouraged in these fields,” Boris said. “That’s partially because of the 24/7 kind of workload in which men more often have other household members to pick up the slack.”</p>\n<p>Diane Mackie, a mother and psychology professor, is a testament to the difficulties of balancing a work and home life. UCSB hired Mackie in 1984, the same year she graduated with a M.A. and doctoral degree from Princeton University. Mackie waited until she had tenure and was a full professor before she had her two sons, who are now 11 and 14 years old.</p>\n<p>“It’s always a trade off,” Mackie said. “Instead of being a superstar professor and a supermom, you are sometimes stuck being a ‘good enough’ mom and a ‘good enough’ professor.”</p>\n<p>According to Mackie, aspiring tenure-trackers must establish themselves in their field early on. However, with evidence that fertility issues and diseases such as autism are linked to giving birth at an older age, less women may be willing to delay child bearing in the future.</p>\n<p>Mackie added that even women who are established in their field and have strong support systems at home have difficulties managing their time.</p>\n<p>“Even with the most liberal, equal-minded guy, women still have the babies,” said Mackie. “There is no ‘good’ time for that in a career.”</p>\n<p>Although some overcome the challenge of having families while working as professors and researchers, social norms prevent many females from acting competitively to get the best pay and the best jobs.</p>\n<p>UCSB regularly matches offers that professors get from other institutions. However, if UCSB is not interested in paying the employee more to keep them at the university, the individual has to take the new job. According to Mackie, many women are hesitant to consider moving their family.</p>\n<p>“Men are more likely to put themselves on the market,” she said. “I suspect that women don’t like to play that game as much.”</p>\n<p>Barbara Prezelin is one of the top paid women at UCSB and a 37-year veteran of the Dept. of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology. She said that she has petitioned to receive earned bonuses, but added that many females do not act as aggressively to get higher pay when it is deserved.</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_30434\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">[media-credit id=13831 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1299171316\" data-slb-group=\"30428\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-30434\" data-attachment-id=\"30434\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/ns4aug10_stemcell-7-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=1302%2C1090&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1302,1090\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1280341838\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"31\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"NS4Aug10_StemCell (7)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=250%2C209&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=888%2C743&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7-250x209.jpg?resize=250%2C209\" alt=\"\" title=\"NS4Aug10_StemCell (7)\" width=\"250\" height=\"209\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-30434\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=250%2C209&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C857&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=120%2C100&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?w=1302&amp;ssl=1 1302w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-30434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A female scientist transfers cell media in a UCSB lab earlier this year. </p></div></span>“I do think that male colleagues are far more likely to self advocate for accelerations in promotions which leads to higher pay scales and/or go [through] the trouble to look for possible jobs elsewhere in order to leverage for higher retention pay,” Prezelin said in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>According to Boris, all women in academia, regardless of what institution they work at, what department they are in or how aggressively they pursue fair pay, are at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>“It isn’t that women are being discriminated against as individuals, it’s the way the structures are set up at this point,” she said. “The structures represent the ideal worker as the unencumbered individual. More men have been unencumbered individuals.”</p>\n<p>However, work cultures at UCSB were markedly worse for women a mere 14 years ago. In 1997, Professor Yolanda Broyles-Gonzales pressed charges against the university after a study showed that UCSB was the ninth worst offender of unequal pay for professors in the nation. Broyles-Gonzalez, who is now a professor at the University of Arizona, eventually settled out of court and became the first woman in history to win a gender pay equity lawsuit against the UC system.</p>\n<p>“The lawsuit has been very important in my life, for many reasons. The outcomes were many,” Broyles-Gonzalez said in an e-mail. “One of the conditions of my settlement was the establishment of a Gender Equity Review at UCSB for women faculty.”</p>\n<p>Since the settlement, administrators UC-wide have tried to reduce gender gaps and ease the strain on working mothers. But has it worked?</p>\n<p>“It’s only been in the past ten years that [work cultures have] changed here in the UC system,” Ricardo Alcaíno, director &amp; title IX officer at the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment, said. “That’s because in the last ten years, there has been such a huge number of influx of not only females into academia and doctoral programs but also males that don’t want to give up their entire life. They want to be multi-dimensional, not one-dimensional.”</p>\n<p>UCSB initiated the Breastfeeding Support Program in 2007 with grant money from the Orfalea Foundation. Five private rooms on campus are available where lactating mothers can feed their children or access breast pumps.</p>\n<p>“It’s another way to encourage faculty … to get their child, nurse their child or another one of their spouses can come by with the child, they nurse and be on their way,” Alcaíno said.</p>\n<p>According to Liz Molina, Breastfeeding Support Program organizer and UCSB human resources office manager, approximately 30 women take part in the free service.</p>\n<p>“It is convenient and it’s a lot nicer than the other options where someone is pumping in the bathroom or in their car,” Molina said. “Pumping takes a long time … so you do want privacy.”</p>\n<p>In 1991, the university’s children services expanded into West Campus. Today, the Orfalea Family Children’s Center and Infant and Toddler Center work with more than 200 children ranging from ages three months to five years.</p>\n<p>Leslie Voss, director of UCSB Childhood Care and Education Services, said 55 percent of the parents who bring their children to the centers are faculty and staff. Voss added that the center staff do what they can to help ease the strain on working parents.</p>\n<p>“Their children’s needs always come first and obviously are the top of the list of priorities,” she said. “But the demands of work, whether as a staff member or faculty … is very challenging.”</p>\n<p>According to Voss, the centers cater to the needs of parents by extending hours during exam weeks, providing parent support groups and assisting families during times of crisis.</p>\n<p>Academic climates have also adapted to the needs of working parents. For example, faculty meeting times are no longer scheduled at 4 or 5 p.m., the prime time for picking up children from school. The university also “stops the clock” for those on the track to tenure, allowing individuals to take anywhere up to a year off in order to care for new children or elderly family members.</p>\n<p>However, while Boris said UCSB has certainly made efforts to assist female faculty with children, it simply isn’t enough.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is doing a good job in trying to stop the clock for those dealing with family pregnancy, taking care of newborns and adopting children,” Boris said. “But the work cultures haven’t changed.”</p>\n<p>Mackie added that the work climate has changed for the better in recent years, but that “little things … can make it harder.” She said that UCSB does not offer camps during most holidays and the university’s quarter system does not align well with other school’s calendars.</p>\n<p>“How much easier it would be to have spring break — or even one week of it — align with the kids’ spring break,” Mackie said.</p>\n<p>Wilder said maintaining the current level of child care available for UCSB staff and faculty is imperative. She added that infant care is needed by many more UCSB employees. But, because infant care is high-cost and the university is dealing with a budget crisis, Wilder said infant care probably will not be expanded without a subsidy for the child care center.</p>\n<p>“I really think that if the UC system saw child care as an essential service it provides to its working employees and students, as opposed to operating the child care centers as business models, we could have more confidence in the continued high quality, accessibility and affordability of the care our children receive,” she said.</p>\n<p>However, there is also a more personal side to the story. With her busy schedule, Wilder said having fun and enjoying family time is often lost in everyday endeavors.</p>\n<p>“Another challenge is the emotional question of whether we are doing the right thing, whether we are making the right sacrifice — sacrificing time home with the kids when they are young for working in a job I enjoy in order to make enough money to continue living in Santa Barbara,” she said. “That sometimes can be very stressful to reflect on.”</p>\n<p>Alcaíno said although academia is rooted in male-centric traditions, systematic changes are inevitable with an influx of working mothers and a change in family dynamics.</p>\n<p>“In the next five to ten years, the cultures will start changing by the numbers — sheer numbers,” he said. “There will be a change in the chemistry of the culture.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30428\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30428\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/","id":3528,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3527,3526,3525],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
