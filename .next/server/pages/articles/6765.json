With our hand-held slave boxes demanding our constant attention, it can be hard focusing on what really matters: beating off.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those prophetic words of wisdom come from UCSB musician Underbelly’s informative YouTube channel, which sarcastically aids viewers with making beats of their own. These blunt videos, however, are only a portion of what the young DJ has to offer the future of music. 1,436 SoundCloud followers and counting and a new EP full of futuristic vibes, the Santa Barbara prodigy is set to take the electronic scene by storm in only a matter of time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timmy Linetsky, also known as Underbelly on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, is a UCSB film major from Palo Alto, California. He started producing rudimentary beats on an MPC 500 at age 14 after hearing DJ Shadow’s entirely sampled 1996 cult classic, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endtroducing…</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Since then he has switched to commonly used production software Ableton and refined his sound to the Underbelly we know today. Along with DJ Shadow, some other influences of his are Balam Acab, Clams Casino and the revolutionary jazz/hip hop instrumentalist Flying Lotus. After years of studying the greats and perfecting his own craft, the UCSB student is ready to create some classics of his own.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underbelly recently went on a european tour with Azeem Ward and just released an extremely promising 3-track EP entitled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ripple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on April 19.

The dauntingly strong opening track, “Breather,” captivates its listeners with a Kali Uchis vocal sample that demands a second play. “Stingray” follows, with an intimate piano sample and steadily bouncing beat that expresses raw and powerful emotion, even without any words. The ending track, appropriately titled, “the end,” closes the EP with dreamy ambient chords that shake the listener into musical oblivion. A very thick and smooth collection, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ripple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes for great study music as well as an ambitious soundtrack for the DJ’s gradual rise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A mere taste of what he has to offer, Timmy commented on the work, stating “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ripple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I hope to make a splash that reverberates far and wide in today’s music world while also testing the waters before releasing my debut album later this year.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than anything, I was just tired of keeping these songs to myself for so long and was itching to put them out there. I found three tracks that I thought flowed together in a cohesive way while also being distinct enough from one another to showcase the full range of my production style.” Although dripping with potential, this album only scratches the surface of what Underbelly has in store.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with an upcoming show at SOhO on May 26, Underbelly has plans for a full length debut album with Alpha Pup records as well as an R&amp;B collaboration album, both of which are set to drop this year. Going into more detail about the R&amp;B project, Timmy entailed, “Seriously, this guy’s voice is as thick and sweet as molasses and matches my production perfectly.”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, if his new endeavors resemble anything of his past work, UCSB and the rest of the world are in for a serious treat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the name of supporting local talent and, more importantly, in the name of quality art, we strongly urge all of you to check this guy out. The sound quality is there, the drive is apparent and he’s starting to make some big moves. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ripple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a seriously head-nodding EP, and it’s only the beginning. In an electronic music era that’s growing exponentially, fresh faces like this one are becoming the future of headed. So please do yourself, UCSB and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a favor and check out one of the coolest hidden gems on the internet.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

“Heading Home” tour, the multi-instrumentalist and music producer, Gryffin, made a special pit stop at UC Santa Barbara in The Hub last Thursday, May 5, for a special pre-Extravaganza performance hosted by A.S. Program Board. The musician, whose real name is Dan Griffith, first learned to play music via the piano at a very young age. “I started taking classical piano lessons when I was seven. I’ve been playing instruments for a while, and then I picked up the guitar when I was in middle school,” Gryffin shared in an exclusive interview with the <em>Daily Nexus</em>. Infused with live elements of an electric guitar, piano keyboard and melodic house beats, Gryffin’s sound is immediately presumed to be influenced by the classic rock genre.</p>\n<p>“Even when I was younger, my older cousin Dustin was in this band called Thrice — which was a punk, hardcore-type band. I idolized him growing up and went to a lot of his shows,” the producer reminisced of his early musical inspirations.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70929\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1401915147\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70927\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70929\" data-attachment-id=\"70929\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/artsweek-sits-down-turns-up-with-gryffin/chrome-sparks-hub_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Chrome Sparks Hub_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70929 size-medium\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Chrome Sparks Hub_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chrome-Sparks-Hub_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70929\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The opening DJs, UCSB’s own Conner McEuen a.k.a. Comrad and East Coast native Chrome Sparks dropped low tempo bass sets with remixed songs including, Chris Brown’s “Run It” and Simian Mobile Disco’s “I Got This Down.” At promptly 10:20 p.m., the headliner opened his show with a very own remix of Ellie Goulding’s “Burn.” As one of his early records, “Burn” introduced Gryffin into the mainstream EDM fans after the version was chosen to be included in the song’s official remixes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It wasn’t until I got to college that I started to get into dance music and that was when I picked up Ableton [the music software], which was what I still produce in now,” Gryffin explained. “The songs that I remember thinking dance music; what made me fall in love with it was, have you heard that song, Guru Josh Project’s ‘Infinity’? It’s like a serious throw back song now, but I remember looking back listening to that, and being like, ‘what is this music, this is insane,’ it’s sort of what opened my eyes.”</p>\n<p>With a series of original remixed hits such as Banks’ “Beggin For Thread,” Years’ “Desire” and BØRNS’ “Electric Love,” the Bay Area native accompanied each track with a live instrument of a guitar or keyboard for a fresh, unique sound. Most notably known for working with new artists like those mentioned above, Gryffin is a champion for rising talents. “Something about the up and comers, like supporting the music that is on the rise, it’s really exciting to work in that wheel house because it’s like fresh ideas and fresh inspiration — just like being in the mentality and mindset of those types of artists,” Gryffin said. “I’m really inspired by Bob Moses. I got to do a bunch of stuff with them at SXSW and Ultra — which was really cool.”</p>\n<p>The highlight of the night was Gryffin’s original production with singer Josef Salvat in the record titled, “Heading Home.” As the artist/producer’s first ever single, the track is an uplifting dance anthem that speaks of finding a guiding path in life amidst of the chaos and hardships. The song is a big transition for the musician, who has thus far only released remixes of original songs from various artists. A big surprise of the night came from an appearance of singer and UCSB student Grace Nevins, who sang a new, unreleased track, “Love In Ruins.”</p>\n<p>“I think ultimately the remixes is how I got my name out there to begin with so I don’t have to abandon that at all. I still enjoy doing it, but over the course of the next year, it’s definitely going to be more of a focus to do my own stuff,” Gryffin spoke about his new music. “I’m working on an EP right now. I’ve got another single that is almost finished that I’ll probably come out with in June. I’m just actively pursuing and working on a bunch of new content”.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70930\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1846474080\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70927\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70930\" data-attachment-id=\"70930\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/artsweek-sits-down-turns-up-with-gryffin/gryffin-in-the-hub-5-5-16-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=3000%2C2003&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2003\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gryffin in the Hub 5-5-16\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-70930\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gryffin-Hub-Show_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70930\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>To conclude the night, Gryffin ended his set with his most famous remix, Tove Lo’s “Talking Body,” (which was also the song that introduced me to the artist). With 17 million plays on both SoundCloud and Spotify, “Talking Body” has catapulted the musician to a wider audience of fans and music critics. After playing the final guitar chord of the song, the musician thanked the audience for coming to see the show. The 26-year-old debuted his live performance this past New Year’s Eve at SnowGlobe Music Festival and has been headlining his first tour ever since. Gryffin is ultimately looking forward to some free time to obtain brand new inspiration after finishing up his sold out tour, “I get to enjoy a few months off in the summer to write music, which is gonna be sweet!”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

embarked on the musical journey of what would become their latest album, <em>Wiped Out. </em>Since the release of the album, the band has restlessly toured numerous cities across several countries. Sweater weather may be over for Santa Barbara natives, but as of this Tuesday, The Neighbourhood will be bringing it back in full force to the Majestic Ventura Theater. The show was originally booked at the Santa Barbara Bowl but made a move to the Majestic Ventura Theater, where all tickets will be honored.</p>\n<p>The two EPs <em>I’m</em> <em>Sorry </em>and <em>Thank You </em>and debut album <em>I Love You</em> respectively were the building blocks for the success of the band we as they are today. They became known for their black and white aesthetic, as seen in their scenic rotating clips for songs like “Flawless” and “WDYWFM,” along with their overall social media presence. With their appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” The Neighbourhood performed a stylish live television debut in black and white. Even after the departure of their original drummer Bryan Sammis, their status as the band to be on the lookout for remained, as did their loyal fanbase dedicated to decoding their cryptic melodies. In 2014 The Neighbourhood dropped a mixtape titled <em>#000000 &amp; #FFFFFF</em>. The mixtape consisted of several singles the band had previously released along with a few new ones featuring artists like YG, Raury and French Montana.</p>\n<p>After the release of the mixtape, however, the band went off the radar for a span of time to recover from the constant shows and festivals they had booked as well as to get to the root of what their next work of art would be. Out of this brief hiatus bloomed their sophomore album<em> Wiped Out!,</em> a fiery, complex treasure that would take all of their fans and critics by surprise. Listening to the album by its lonesome is a journey, so seeing The Neighbourhood bring it to life will be a vivid experience. There is no doubt that this band aims to please, and it would be an honor for anyone to say they were in attendance when the Majestic Ventura Theater got “wiped out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Regardless of what the details consisted of, if one were to compile a soundtrack for that summer it would include Walk The Moon’s youthful tune, “Anna Sun,” crafted as if it were made for that summer. Not just because it was named song of the summer by various publications, but because it is difficult to not associate it with breathless, unscathed memories accompanied by the feeling of lightning running wild through the heart. Walk The Moon is giving fans the chance to relive those memories and obtain several more Friday, May 27 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, supported by MisterWives.</p>\n<p>Walk The Moon is the type of band to release a song that will send your emotions spiraling, yet one tends to forget to take the time to get close with their music. There are numerous releases of good music day by day, so it makes it difficult to accomplish such a task. However, when it comes to Walk The Moon, it is rewarding to be more than merely familiar with their music; those that actually take the time to immerse themselves in their sounds might just discover their new favorite song.</p>\n<p>Similar to the love they received for “Anna Sun,” Walk The Moon received overwhelming attention for “Shut Up and Dance,” an upbeat, electric single from their latest album, <em>Talking is Hard</em>. In comparison to a number of their other tracks, the song proves difficult to sit through without singing or dancing from the heart. Out of all of their songs, both “Anna Sun” and “Shut Up and Dance” are the two that the band is commonly associated with, so one could expect to experience the joy flowing off of the stage and into the crowd as people sing in unison with every ounce of love spilling from their lungs.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70839\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70839\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/","id":6764,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6763,6762,6761],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
