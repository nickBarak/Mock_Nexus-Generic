SG Lewis, first debuted in Santa Barbara with a DJ set in The Hub. Last Wednesday night marked his return, although this time the 24-year-old <span class=\"s1\">performed </span>a brand new live show and brought an arsenal of new tunes with him, showcasing <span class=\"s1\">just</span> how far his music <span class=\"s1\">has progressed in a single year</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The show was set against dark brick walls that define SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club’s industrial interior in downtown Santa Barbara. On stage was a basic five-piece band setup that sat atop a large, intricately designed carpet, dimly lit by a chilling mixture of blue and green lights. It was an effortless and simple design, but alluring <span class=\"s1\">nonetheless</span> <span class=\"s1\">—</span> one that sp<span class=\"s1\">oke</span> well to Lewis’<span class=\"s1\">s </span>style of electronic music.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Walking inside the venue, I noticed that the initial energy and excitement for Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>show seemed lacking. For <span class=\"s1\">nearly </span>an hour, people lingered between aRod’s opening set and the bar, although most hovered around the bar until <span class=\"s1\">right </span>before Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s</span> performance. Perhaps the Wednesday night drink specials distracted from the usual pre-show excitement but, regardless, as soon as the lights shut off and the infectious build-up of “Coming Up” started playing, the energy flipped.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">“Coming Up” was one of two singles released from Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s</span> <i>Dusk</i> EP, which came out earlier this year in April. The EP is the first component of Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>much-anticipated debut album, <i>Dusk, Dark, Dawn</i>, a three-part, 18-track series with each part being <span class=\"s1\">set to release</span> separately.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Inspired by Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>history and fascination with U.K. club culture, each part of the album attempts to relay the distinctive moods, sounds and energies that make up different phases of a typical night out. First <span class=\"s1\">come </span>the feelings of anticipation and excitement for what’s to come<span class=\"s1\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">then</span> the sort of high-energy peak felt at the top of the night and<span class=\"s1\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">finally,</span> the downtempo comedown that follows that energy.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>show last week served as an introductory experience to the musical expression of synerg<span class=\"s1\">y</span> between every different phase of a night out. Even on a Wednesday night, by curating a set that sonically builds, peaks and <span class=\"s1\">subsequently </span>comes back down<span class=\"s1\">, Lewisb guided </span>audience members through the exact journey of emotion and energy that inspired his upcoming album.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Transitioning from “Coming Up” into some of his upbeat tracks like “All Night” and “Better” (<span class=\"s1\">featuring</span> rising electropop star Clairo) solidified the vibe of the first phase. As more people crowded closer to the stage, it was evident that excitement was rising <span class=\"s1\">as </span>each song played. Needless to say, the previously off-putting <span class=\"s1\">atmosphere that filled the club </span>no longer existed in the presence of Lewis, who was accompanied by two other instrumentalists and a captivating duo of vocalists.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Then, songs with heavier overtones like “Times We had” and “Smart Aleck Kill” <span class=\"s1\">furthered the crowd’s excitement and</span> <span class=\"s1\">brought </span>them closer to t<span class=\"s1\">he</span> peak energy level that Lewis likely wanted<span class=\"s1\">. In order to maintain that level of enthusiasm, he dropped</span> his most recent banger, “Hurting,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> with fellow Brit AlunaGeorge. <span class=\"s1\">A</span>t this point <span class=\"s1\">in</span> the night, the room was noticeably hotter, people were sweatier and the crowd was moving more groovily than ever.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But, a return to the slow magic of Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>signature sound <span class=\"s1\">was </span>what truly <span class=\"s1\">tied</span> th<span class=\"s1\">is whole</span> sonic experience together. Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>sound is deeply mellow and introspective. It’s moody, minimal and full of synth — but also commanding<span class=\"s1\"> and</span> strong.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">His style<span class=\"s1\"> differentiates him from</span> the higher BPMs usually associated with EDM and, even more so, from the headbanging trap, bumpy house and tir<span class=\"s1\">i</span>ng future bass that currently dominates most electronic scenes. However, <span class=\"s1\">he has proved that </span>this does not make his music any less danceable or invigorating. In fact, it’s what landed him alongside U.K. powerhouse names like Disclosure and Jessie Ware at PMR Records in the first place.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">What is so interesting about<span class=\"s1\"> Lewis’s show and his </span>latest project is how definitive it is of his multifaceted musicality. His ability to pull from a multitude of influences — whether <span class=\"s1\">it be </span>disco, East Coast hip-hop, R&amp;B or indie — and still maintain the cool and calm composure <span class=\"s1\">which </span>characterizes his niche in electronic music is fascinating.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Ending with “Warm,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> a slow-burning tune he impressively sang himself, and an encore comprised of both an unreleased track <span class=\"s1\">and </span>“Yours,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> Lewis truly encapsulated the crowd in the sort of sentiments that define the end of a night out <span class=\"s1\">—</span> bittersweet and empty, <span class=\"s1\">but </span>also a longing for <span class=\"s1\">the peak’s sweet return</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Lewis has proven <span class=\"s1\">his ability to master a</span> myriad of sounds<span class=\"s1\">,</span> and if Wednesday night was any indicator of how effective his forthcoming album will be in telling the narrative he <span class=\"s1\">intends</span>, I<span class=\"s1\"> a</span>m positive he <span class=\"s1\">will be successful</span>.</p>\n<div

groundbreaking about Troye Sivan’s journey. He has all the trappings of a star: a legion of loyal fans, a model boyfriend and muse status in the eyes of countless fashion designers. What’s groundbreaking is Sivan’s grasp on maturity and queer identity while simultaneously producing radio-ready tracks on par with today’s brightest stars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An openly gay Australian pop sensation, Sivan took a fairly conventional route to fame. A product of his time, Sivan first rose to prominence on YouTube, accumulating millions of subscribers with his daily vlogs. By the age of 18, Sivan came out publicly in a video, which now has over eight million views. He soon transitioned from YouTube to the music industry, in typical Disney Channel star fashion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His first album, 2015’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Neighborhood</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, saw Sivan tackle the struggles of coming of age and coming out. The synth-pop album captures the highs and lows of adolescence, hitting all the usual boxes: unrequited love, identity issues and even the trappings of the suburbs. It’s the kind of album that could score every scene in a high school rom-com, with its highest charting single appropriately titled “YOUTH.” While the album showed the promise of Sivan’s eventual star status, its uneven pacing and crowded tracklisting reflected his rookie nature. Sivan still needed to do a little growing in order to find his true voice. Now, in 2018, Sivan is in full bloom.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, released Aug. 30, reveals Sivan as a fully defined popstar, confident in his own queer identity and powerful with his own voice. Troye rides the recent wave of “poptimism,” following the likes of Ariana Grande’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweetener </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Lorde’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melodrama</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, harnessing the fun and brightness of pop music in order to produce an album that is genuinely enjoyable to listen to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening track, “Seventeen,” bridges the gap between his first and second releases as Sivan recounts his first sexual experience as a 17-year-old. The heartbreaking song tells of Sivan being lured into a meetup with an older man on Grindr. Sivan sings of the experience from a perspective that one only gains from actually growing up as he explores the motivations of his younger self: “I went out looking for love when I was 17 / Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me.” Rather than dwell on the emotions and politics of the moment, Sivan focuses on the curiosity and loneliness that drove him to the exchange. The thoughtful retrospective captures the naivety of youth and the mistakes that insecurity and instability can cause. However, Sivan is no longer that naive, lonely, gay teen and sings from a newly found perspective of wisdom and maturity. Sivan has already done his growing and is ready to showcase what it means to be fully formed, confident and queer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MY MY MY!” does just that, following Sivan onto the dance floor, where he commands attention with ease: “Don’t make me wait another day / ‘Cause passion is passion / You know it just as well as me.” Troye alternates seductive whispers and a booming chorus accompanied by an uptempo dance-ready beat. “MY MY MY!” shows Sivan at his sexiest as he coaxes the object of his affection into his arms. The music video released with the track captures Sivan’s command of his newly found sex symbol status, as he dances fully unabridged and fully queer in an abandoned warehouse, accompanied by shirtless men.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan imbues this electrifying, bright, optimistic energy to the rest of album, which alternates ballads and bangers. The titular track, “Bloom,” finds itself on the upbeat side as Sivan not so subtly references “bottoming.” As with the rest of album, Sivan gives little worry to the binaries of sexuality and gender, speaking freely about a topic that has been given little freedom to be expressed in popular culture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another upbeat highlight is Sivan’s collaboration with Ariana Grande, “Dance To This.” The two combine forces to deliver an ode to staying in rather than going out. At a time when Grande has never been bigger, Sivan manages to keep the spotlight evenly balanced between the two stars, as their angelic voices combine to create a soothing club track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan’s evolution as an artist is most obvious when he is at his most understated and vulnerable. Rather than pushing each track to emotional explosion and relying on catharsis to imbue effect, Sivan allows himself to shine in his most breathy, low-key moments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The acoustic ballad, “The Good Side,” showcases Sivan’s sweetness, as the mature relationship retrospective emphasizes respect and empathy over the pettiness breakups often go hand-in-hand with. Meanwhile, “Animal,” an experimental ballad ripe with desire and longing, slowly builds until a Frank Oceanic release ends the song in euphoria.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sivan’s bright, fruitful and flowery imagery subverts the typical masculine pop archetype, perhaps ushering in a new era of artists who reject toxic masculinity and embrace vulnerability. Sivan produces imagery based on the queer experience; however, his masterful pop music is for everyone. Each song on the 10 track listing leaves a bright, harmonious and euphoric feeling in the ears of listeners, signifying Sivan’s rightful place among today’s hitmakers. Perhaps because of society’s slowly changing views on sexuality and gender, there has never been an openly queer artist quite so poised for mainstream success like Sivan. And with Sivan’s razor-sharp execution of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it seems like he’s more than ready to rise to the occasion.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83987\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/bloom-by-troye-sivan-a-mature-leap-toward-pop-stardom/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83987\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/bloom-by-troye-sivan-a-mature-leap-toward-pop-stardom/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/bloom-by-troye-sivan-a-mature-leap-toward-pop-stardom/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/bloom-by-troye-sivan-a-mature-leap-toward-pop-stardom/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/bloom-by-troye-sivan-a-mature-leap-toward-pop-stardom/","id":6624,"author":{"id":695,"name":"Alex Modiano"},"related":[6623,6622,6621],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Miguel Closes Out Summer at SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Miguel-SB-Bowl_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Miguel-SB-Bowl_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The stage presence of Miguel is articulate and precise, alarmingly reminiscent of the way Michael Jackson used to move about the stage and command his audience’s attention. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the first day of school at UCSB just around the corner, many Santa Barbarans chose to wrap up the summer with a night of innovative,  latin-inspired pop music from Miguel and his openers at the gorgeous outdoor venue of the Santa Barbara Bowl. With support from Nonchalant Savant and OVO signee DVSN, this performance from Miguel’s “The Ascension Tour” was as rehearsed, focused and high-energy as possible, with clear precision and performative value that is practiced, methodical and passionate. This show from Miguel demands acknowledgement of the strength in his entire discography and his long future to come in the music industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DVSN took the stage in preparation for Miguel, and the simple stage setup of three background singers and vocalist Daniel Daley with a mic set the focus solely on vocal prowess, something that Dvsn is very akin to. He performed a wide array of tracks from his three projects, showcasing his extremely wide range of vocal ability, namely his gorgeously high falsetto voice. Midway through his set, Dvsn had his DJ play some classic 90s R&amp;B for the crowd to dance to, which seemingly was a highlight but came off as a cheaper attempt to gain attention from the audience. Despite this, DVSN’s stage presence is undeniable, and the OVO wave of R&amp;B seems to be in good hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miguel took the stage around 9:15 with a full band, backup singers and a staircase set in the middle of the stage, in alignment with other variations of Ascension to come. He opened with various cuts from new album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Leisure,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including “Banana Clip” and “Harem,” all performed with instrumental variations and a free range of vocal runs. The rock-inspired electric guitar elements in his music play a much bigger role in a live context, as the sharp riffs cut through the air and added powerful sound to the performance. Miguel would later explain that the set is divided into three stages, ending in full ascension in which him and the audience “skywalk,” concluding with his career’s biggest hit, “Sky Walker.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

He had constant choreographed dance moves along to the beat of his tracks and with background dancers behind him. The consistent jumps, hip movements and flails in sync with drum fills, guitar licks and beat switch-ups were crisp, clean and exciting. He began to lose momentum, however, whenever he addressed the crowd directly. His constant rambling about “energy,” “meditation” and the “spirituality” of his performance came off as baseless, as Miguel’s image has always been more lighthearted and transparent as a neo-pop artist. Also, his constant priming of the audience for the performance of “Skywalker” seemed to be a ploy for audience attention. Frequently asking the crowd “Are you guys ready to Skywalk?” after every few songs seemed to have the opposite effect from what was intended. Despite this, the purely musical aspects of the performance were impeccable, with strong instrumentation, vocals and choreography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the set Miguel played a variety of older cuts from previous albums such as sex anthem “Arch and Point,” hit single “Adorn,” the self critique “So I Lied” and the revered, albeit controversial track “Do You…” (like drugs?). In cautious fashion, Miguel made a point to follow up the latter track with a disclaimer that all drugs should be done safely and in moderation, a slightly cringeworthy yet necessary message, given the state of drug use in popular music today. I assumed, as I’m sure many in the crowd did, that Miguel would take some time to honor past collaborator Mac Miller after his passing, but unfortunately that moment was not taken during the performance. This functions as evidence that, in the midst of growing older and more mature, Miguel has been at a crossroads in navigating his image of edgy sex and drug icon and his wise creative persona, and he may not know what kind of image he wants to sell at this point in his career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The set ended with more cuts from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Leisure</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the Kali Uchis Spanish cut “Carmelo Duro” and dreamy landscape “Pineapple Skies.” He concluded his set, as predicted by himself and the audience, with his mega-hit “Sky Walker,” a moment that perhaps felt reduced after the previous hour of hyping it up. Regardless, the track was performed elegantly and with maximum response from the crowd, as “Sky Walker” marks one of the most energetic and fun songs of Miguel’s career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was more than pleased with the celebration of music, maturity and freedom that Miguel delivered at the Santa Barbara Bowl. Despite some flaws in his monologue and constant references to “Sky Walking,” the entire crowd was happy with his musical execution. Miguel is clearly aware of his talent and potential and will not hesitate to utilize these to the fullest of his ability. As the tour name suggests, Miguel has nowhere to go but up.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

another year of stoner hippie magic, the Desert Daze music festival left quite a mark on its attendees this year. With exciting headliners such as indie gods Tame Impala, classic shoegaze act My Bloody Valentine, and Australian psych-pop band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, this three-day festival seemed like the perfect escape into a psychedelic wonderland.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As I was driving myself out to Lake Perris, Desert Daze’s new location, I got a phone call from one of my housemates telling me that she had been waiting in line for parking for over an hour. By the time I finally made it all the way out there myself, I recognized instantly what she was talking about. The line of cars waiting to get into the festival spanned over a mile or two until you couldn’t see where the line ended.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Eventually, I noticed more and more people either turning their cars completely off because of the stand-still, inescapable traffic or sparking up some joints to pass the time while they remained prisoners in their cars. Jocelyn Guardado (@GuardadoJocelyn) even wrote via Twitter, “First and last desert daze. Car ran out [of] gas from the long line. I love waiting in this heat so that my boyfriend can walk two miles to the nearest gas station.” Although Guardado’s case is unfortunate, several others claimed to have waited as long as four hours and still missed most of the Friday performances.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">Once inside the venue, it was clear the anger from trying to park had vanished and most festival goers were once again excited for the music. Although Desert Daze, as the name mentions, is normally held in a desert setting, the festival this year made its debut at Lake Perris. It gave off an adult summer camp feel, with campsites across the lot, a beach to swim in and an amazing view of the Moreno Beach mountains. Festival attendees could be seen frolicking in the water as bands played their sets right next to them. In addition to the beauty of Mother Nature that engulfed Desert Daze, several fun food vendors and other booths were scattered throughout the festival grounds.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Like Coachella and other music festivals, Desert Daze had multiple stages: the Moon, the Block, the Theatre, the Sanctuary and the Mystic Bazaar. Besides the Bazaar, which was for campers only, each stage was relatively close to one another, making it easy for attendees to hop from band to band and view insane, Instagram-worthy art installations along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Although it was apparent most attendees were mainly excited to see Tame Impala, the rest of the bands on the Friday lineup didn’t disappoint. Lesser known artists like Idles, Hinds and Jarvis Cocker shone as old and new fans alike were captivated by their performances, often taking small breaks from dancing to light up and drink. More interestingly, though, was the performance of Warpaint, who took the stage right before Tame Impala. Their psych-rock sound, in combination with the feminine edge that comes exclusively from a girls-only band, seemed to call each person to the stage with their hits like “Elephants,” “Undertow” and “Disco//Very.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As the sun began to set on the first night of Desert Daze, the weather became noticeably colder and more people could be seen retreating to their cars to grab jackets, hats and more joints. Though the main stage had been previously occupied by fans enjoying the sets of Warpaint and Pond a couple hours earlier, the Moon Stage was now filled to the max with agonizing anticipation of Tame Impala’s performance. However, it wasn’t until lightning started to strike that the excitement grew.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Scheduled to perform at 10 p.m., Tame Impala entered the stage about 10 minutes late, beginning with their song “Nangs” accompanied by trippy, psychedelic visual art that covered the screens surrounding the band. As the rain began to pick up and lightning became more frequent, Tame Impala quickly jumped into “Let It Happen,” inciting the whole crowd to collectively jump and sway their heads side to side to the familiar and well-loved song. As the long instrumental break blared out of the speakers, my view of Kevin Parker diminished as I got lost in a cloud of weed and vape smoke coming from my fellow standing neighbors.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">While Tame Impala played for as long and well as they could, they were no match for the storm that was to come. The flashes of lightning continued to get so much brighter and more frequent than before that festival attendees began enjoying the scene, fully immersing themselves in the chaos of music and nature combining into one coherent experience. So, when the music stopped after 20 minutes and Parker said, “Sorry guys, we gotta go,” it was clear no one had anticipated this short ending. One of the festival coordinators then came out and assured fans that Tame Impala would come back out after the weather cleared up but that everyone was urged to seek shelter in cars or buildings. In the end, though, the Tame set was canceled as well as every other act scheduled to perform after them — and fans were pissed.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">In an attempt to make up for the unforeseen weather disturbances during Friday, Desert Daze gave everyone free parking for the weekend and allowed attendees with Friday tickets to enjoy the festival on Saturday as well at no extra charge.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">When Saturday morning finally came around, the rain, lightning and thunder had ceased, creating a cool forecast for festival goers to enjoy throughout the rest of the weekend. To close the show, Death Grips and My Bloody Valentine performed back-to-back, giving audience members unique takes on what psychedelic music can sound like. While Death Grips gave a rather exciting performance, never taking any breaks during their set, My Bloody Valentine really brought it home with their signature garage rock playing that incited enormous response from the crowd. This was especially apparent during their song “Soon,” to which many fans began jumping and throwing elbows and fists as a form of dancing.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Though there were some pretty big hiccups with the organization and execution of this festival, Desert Daze still gave its attendees a great playground to meet new people, camp, swim and, of course, enjoy the music.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Hopefully, they will look at the weather report next year!</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kvalencia/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kristina Valencia</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kristina Valencia is a fourth-year undergrad majoring in English, minoring in Professional Writing, and working as the Artsweek editor at Daily Nexus.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:kvalencia@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/desert-daze-2018-in-review/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/desert-daze-2018-in-review/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/desert-daze-2018-in-review/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/desert-daze-2018-in-review/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/desert-daze-2018-in-review/","id":6626,"author":{"id":662,"name":"Kristina Valencia"},"related":[6625,6624,6623],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
