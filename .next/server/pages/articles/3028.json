Neither have previous experience in Associated Students (A.S.) Senate and did not run during either the Spring Quarter 2018 election and the Fall Quarter 2018 special election.</p>\n<p>Zierer is a fourth-year political science and English double major; Ng is a fourth-year biological sciences and global studies double major.</p>\n<p>Neither could immediately be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>A notable absence in the Winter Quarter 2019 special election is third-year history of public policy major Madeline Loudon. Loudon <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/madeline-loudon-is-sole-declared-candidate-for-evpsa-special-election/\">ran for the position</a> during both the Spring Quarter 2018 election and the Fall Quarter 2018 special election.</p>\n<p>In the first, she lost to her competitor, Mayela Morales; in the second she was the sole candidate, but the election did not reach the 16 percent voting threshold required for it to be valid.</p>\n<p>Loudon could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>This is Election Board’s second attempt to fill the position following the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Morales during the Spring Quarter 2018 election.</p>\n<p>The board discovered that Morales, a fifth-year global studies and Chicana and Chicano studies major, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">was not enrolled</a> during Spring Quarter 2018, disqualifying her from the position.</p>\n<p>Following the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-04/breaking-evpsa-seat-to-be-left-vacant-for-rest-of-academic-year/\">failure</a> to meet the minimum voting threshold for the fall election, the board petitioned to hold a Winter Quarter special election. The Senate initially tabled the petition over winter break but eventually passed it the week before school resumed.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate voted to table the ballot Wednesday night, pending further background checks of the candidates.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Lea Toubian expressed concern about voter burnout during Wednesday night’s meeting – because the board has held an election every quarter this school year unlike the typical one-election-a-year system – but Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria said he did not think it would be a problem for the upcoming spring elections.</p>\n<p>Voting for the election opens on Jan. 24, 2019. Results will be announced on Feb. 7. More than eight percent of the student body must vote in the election for it to be valid.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 17, 12:17 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or evelyn@dailynexus.com. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The week-long series of events are also tabled in collaboration with Committee on Committees and a variety of their other Boards, Committees and Commissions (BCCs).</p>\n<p>Today’s event, “A.S. Open House,” will take place at the A.S. Main Office in the Multicultural Center and will offer attendees time to network with A.S. officials. Tomorrow will feature two finance-related events called “Where’s My Money?” and “Teach the Budget.” Finally, Friday’s event, “Student Health Day,” will take place on the SRB Lawn to talk about mental, physical and sexual health.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. President Jonathan Abboud, the campaign was developed by the A.S. Office of the President. The week’s basic goal is to give students opportunities to learn about A.S. and decide whether it is a group they want to get involved in.</p>\n<p>“The project is to make visible all that Associated Students does and publicize Associated Students, get students more informed about where their money is going and what kind of activities we’re working on, especially before the election,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Monday’s event was “Sustainability Day,” which focused on the California drought as well as a number of other environmental issues in the county, especially regarding the coastline community of Santa Barbara. Members of the A.S. Office of the President, I.V. Tenants Union and Environmental Affairs Board also passed out reusable bags, pins supporting water conservation and free food from the I.V. Food Co-Op.</p>\n<p>Megan Roy, a fourth-year environmental studies major and Outreach and Education Coordinator of UCSB Coastal Fund, said the Coastal Fund is an A.S.-funded organization that provides grants for conservation projects for the local coast.</p>\n<p>“There are students who work in different labs, like bio labs … that directly relate to our mission statement of protecting, restoring and enhancing the coast,” Roy said. “It’s really cool to see a student come in and propose their project. We can fund their projects and make them happen.”</p>\n<p>Yesterday’s event was the “A.S. Recruitment Fair,” and at tomorrow’s event, “Where’s My Money?” A.S. will be distributing surveys to garner student input about how students think A.S. should allocate its $10.6 million budget.</p>\n<p>“Every year, we make a new budget, and that is a time we ask to students what they think is important to fund in the budget,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Also taking place tomorrow at the Student Resource Building (SRB) Multipurpose Room from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. will be “Teach the Budget,” a presentation on California’s budget and issues surrounding the financing of higher education.</p>\n<p>“Spring into A.S.” culminates on Friday at the SRB lawn with “Student Health Day.” A bounce house, free candy, condoms and lube will be provided at the event.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, Spring Quarter is when many opportunities open up in A.S. since all of the positions must be re-filled for the next school year. Some of these positions will be in the senate, executive office and BCCs.</p>\n<p>“All the positions in A.S. only last one year, so all 300-plus positions completely turn over every year,” Abboud said. “On top of that, they are employment positions. There’s probably close to 600 to 700 opportunities in A.S. total.”</p>\n<p>Aiden Brorsen, a second-year history of public policy major and Chair of the Committee on Committees, also said he believes now is an ideal time to start getting involved.</p>\n<p>“We are preparing students from spring to summer as opposed to just fall, so it’s kind of like a transitional event,” Brorsen said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54551\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54551\" data-attachment-id=\"54551\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/the-arbor-springs-into-a-s-this-week/springas_petervandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=3832%2C2833&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3832,2833\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1367591152\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"185\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?fit=888%2C656&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-54551\" alt=\"SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SpringAS_PeterVandenbelt-250x184.jpg?resize=250%2C184\" width=\"250\" height=\"184\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-54551\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Spring into A.S.” holds a number of events this week to encourage student involvement in allocation of funds and office positions.

A discussion ensued to determine whether or not to correct the mistake — despite SJP members’ understanding that they would still receive the money — with the final decision culminating in taking back the funding.</p>\n<p>Before discussing the SJP fund issues, however, Executive Officers presented to the Senate the work their offices have been doing in light of the “civil unrest” that occurred Saturday evening of Deltopia, with senators later discussing potential strategies to prevent such occurrences in the future.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jonathan Abboud devoted most of his speaking time to the matter of Deltopia and its repercussions. Abboud said the events were distressing, with bottles and rocks thrown at police personnel and then the police responding with tear gas and rubber bullets. However, he said A.S. reacted quickly to the incidents and that their response was well received by the general public.</p>\n<p>“The cool thing is that we were the ones sending out the message and not the university, so Associated Students was ahead of the game,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud also said most officials seemed open to working with students. In a meeting he attended with External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore and all of the Senior Officers of the university, he said officials looked to find a solution with the students rather than seeking to enact harsher restrictions.</p>\n<p>“We discussed just kind of what happened that weekend, and the tone of the conversation was surprisingly pro-student, and not, ‘Let’s just crack down,’” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said there would be a committee set up to assess the cameras that appeared in Isla Vista just before Deltopia, and he confirmed to Senators that the cameras were paid for by the university and were intended for temporary use only.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker also spoke about Deltopia during his report to the Senate. According to Whittaker, the most pressing issue for his office since Saturday has been that some students have been told by police that they could be evicted from their homes or expelled from UCSB based on their participation in the civil unrest.</p>\n<p>Whittaker said students can only be expelled if they engage in an act that “indicates a breach of the student code of conduct.” Eviction, he said, depends on specific lease agreements and would be left to the discretion of the landlord.</p>\n<p>Moore’s report discussed the reasoning behind requesting an investigation from the Civil Grand Jury on Saturday night’s events. Moore said he and other officers felt it was important to request a third-party investigation since no such circumstances of riots, tear gas and other events came up during previous Deltopias. Moore said he hopes the investigation can shed new light or a different perspective on the incidents that occurred last Saturday.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, we don’t have the answers … We’re looking to the Civil Grand Jury because it’s a fresh set of eyes,” Moore said. “We’re not looking to accuse anyone of anything, we’re just looking for answers, because we’ve had Deltopia for, what, a decade, and this is the first time this has happened.”</p>\n<p>Senators proposed potential actions that the community can take in order to prevent future events from spinning out of control. Ideas suggested included enacting parking restrictions, blocking entrances to I.V. or making Deltopia an official, sanctioned event that could potentially make it easier to regulate.</p>\n<p>After finishing the discussion about Deltopia, Senators went through details of the broken financial code in funding SJP. What initially occurred in the previous meeting was that the Student Commission On Racial Equality (SCORE) decided to allocate $250 for SJP for the group to transport a wall of photographs to the school. However, because SJP already received transportation funding earlier in the year in order to attend a conference, SCORE’S allocation broke code.</p>\n<p>Since Senate approved the allocation in their previous meeting, however, they had the power to choose not to correct the error and allow the group to keep the funding. A debate ensued on whether or not they should revisit the previous meeting’s minutes and correct the mistake.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator John Pena-Soriano said he felt Senators should allow the mistake to pass since the group had been operating under the assumption that they would receive the funding.</p>\n<p>“It seems like it’s really on us,” Pena-Soriano said. “I feel that it’s unfair for us to take away their funding now that we approved it.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Derek Wakefield disagreed with Pena-Soriano. Wakefield said he did not have anything against the group or their reason for requesting funding, but he said he felt that Senators should abide to the legal code regardless.</p>\n<p>“We have to follow policy, otherwise there’s no point in having policy in the first place,” Wakefield said.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Senators voted to strike the funding from SCORE’s minutes, thereby revoking their previous approval.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/","id":3027,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3026,3025,3024],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
