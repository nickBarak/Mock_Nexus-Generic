An icon to many, fans paid tribute to Bryant and his legacy by holding vigils all over the world, but most prominently at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, home to Bryant’s 20-year tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers, The New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/kobe-bryant-la-california.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Santa Barbara, about an hour and a half away from the crash site, an outpour of roughly 200 students gathered under Storke Tower at 8 p.m. to mourn the loss of Bryant, 41, and Gianna, 13.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university was also home to Bryant’s basketball camp, the </span><a href=\"http://www.youth-basketball-camps.com/camps/kobe-bryant-basketball-camp/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kobe Basketball Academy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which ran for eight years at the Thunderdome and was designed to help kids hone their basketball skills, </span><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/kobe_bryant_impact_inspiration_santa_barbara_county_basketball_20200126\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noozhawk reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the center of the vigil rested a picture of Bryant and his daughter, a bouquet of flowers and a poster inscribed “RIP #24 MAMBA.” Bryant’s numbers — 8 and 24 — glimmered off the jerseys of students facing the candlelight, while shades of purple and gold draped the crowd from the many who sported Lakers attire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously, if you came out, Kobe meant a lot to you,” Nasrat Hamid, a fourth-year chemistry major and the event’s organizer, said to the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s kind of crazy how someone I’m sure most of us have never met before had such a huge impact on our lives. It’s kind of silly when you think about it — I’ve never met this guy but here I am crying my eyes out because he just passed away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamid organized the event earlier that same day after emailing Chancellor Henry T. Yang for permission to hold the vigil, and Yang helped provide Hamid with microphones for the event. After getting permission, Hamid’s sister, Nishat Hamid, said they used social media to let students know an event in Bryant’s honor would be taking place that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamid spoke to the crowd first, leaving the microphone open for students who wanted to share their favorite memories about Bryant, the impact he had on their lives and what they’ll remember most about him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As students spoke through the tears, those in the crowd banded together, arms wrapped around one another as they mourned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student who took the mic saw Bryant’s death as an opportunity to look back and resolve the negativities in life that weren’t worth the frustration they caused. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you have any conflict with anyone, maybe just resolve it and say ‘I love you,’ even in  a friendly way. It’s what Kobe would have wanted,” the student said. “I love that man, and even though I don’t know anyone here, I love you all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just keep powering through [your] own lives and look around and love those near [you] because we are not guaranteed a tomorrow.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the minutes leading up to the moment of silence at 8:24 p.m. — to honor both of Bryant’s jersey numbers — one student put his phone next to the microphone to play Lil Wayne’s “Kobe Bryant” after asking the crowd if they’d like to hear the song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few minutes of silence, students resumed speaking to the crowd as others began to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student recalled how an introduction to basketball — and later, a passion for it — came from Bryant, who inspired them to pick up a ball after watching him on television. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m having fun. Kobe taught me how to love the game,” the student said. “I have this Kobe poster in my room and now I can’t look at it all that much anymore, just because it hurts that much.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never got to watch Kobe live, I never got to meet him in person,” the student added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, I will never get the chance to.”</span></p>\n<p>[<em>Correction Jan. 28, 8:33 a.m.]: In a previous version of this article, Nishat Hamid’s name was misspelled.

This set number of swipes expires at the end of each week and cannot be used for the weeks following. In Ferguson and Mitchell’s resolution, the two argue that meal swipes should expire at the end of each quarter, rather than each week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal, as detailed in the resolution, would allow meal swipes to be used throughout the quarter rather than expire each Sunday after dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In order to make full use of student meal plans, there needs to be amendments to how meal plan swipes can be used, by whom, and when they expire,” the resolution reads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution states that students with 17 meal swipes per week or fewer should be able to swipe guests into the dining commons with their own meal swipes, rather than be charged a $12 fee for each guest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the UCSB Housing </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/dining/offcampus-mealplan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a standard 14 meals per week costs $1,532 per quarter. Students who choose to live in the dorms are mandated to buy a meal plan, the cost of which is added in with their housing expenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a lower-income, first-generation, queer college student, I understand the struggles of not knowing when your next meal may come sometimes. I couldn’t afford a meal plan this year because of how expensive they are,” Ferguson said in Wednesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution supports several other modifications to the current meal plan rules, namely removing the cap on how many meals students may donate to the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank each week, which is currently at a maximum of three. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the resolution, the A.S. Food Bank had already been working with Executive Director of Campus Dining Jill Horst to try to implement a policy to allow students to donate more of their meal swipes per week, according to Eric Nava, the Food Bank’s student coordinator and fourth-year religious studies major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been working with Jill to try to raise this cap for about three years now and the process has been very stagnant,” Nava said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nava said the A.S. Food Bank staff supports the resolution and is hopeful that the added support of the Senate position can help them meet their goals in raising or abolishing the current donation cap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The issue isn’t just about accessibility, but also about waste, specifically a waste of money. When something is paid for, it should remain in the system and be reused for students who need those swipes,” said Soha Sadeghinejad, the student sponsor of the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this isn’t the first time meal rollovers have been discussed. Ferguson referred to similar demands made in 2006, when a survey showing support for meal rollover was presented to the UCSB Dining Services director, the Housing &amp; Residential Services executive director and the Residential Housing Association president, citing a previous </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2006-04-04/survey-results-heat-up-debate-over-possible-meal-rollover-system/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> article.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In 2006, On-Campus Senator Nathaniel Wood-Wilde presented a survey to RHA showing that a majority of students supported a meal swipe rollover policy. The RHA were ‘considering the implementation of rollovers in student meal plans’ and were ‘definitely interested to see what works best for students,’” Ferguson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Food insecurity is no joke; it’s a big issue on college campuses, and this resolution is another step in the right direction. Students desperately want change, and through advocacy and support we can make that change a reality,” Sadeghinejad said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 28, 5:23 p.m.] </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-in-support-of-rolling-over-leftover-meal-plan-swipes/","id":3368,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[3367,3366,3365],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No Reported Cases of Coronavirus on Campus, Student Health Says","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The email comes after several UCSB students posted on the UCSB subreddit, r/UCSantaBarbara, late Sunday night with rumors about the virus.
