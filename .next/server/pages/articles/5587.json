Ruddins led the Big West in total kills and kills per set at 587 and 5.34 respectively, while Petrachi found herself at the top in both digs and digs per set at 555 and 4.96 in her senior year.</p>\n<p>The story here is that the 2018-19 Gauchos were able to rebound after a tough 2017-18 season which saw a measly 8-20 record overall and a 7-9 record in conference play. The rebound was a team effort that featured top-level contributions from a variety of positions and experience levels.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were ultimately invited to the National Invitational Volleyball Championship after finishing 9-7 in league play and winning their last three games, including two back-to-back sweeps.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 9-7 league record was their best since the 2013 season and they will be looking to improve as they begin the 2019-20 season this weekend.</p>\n<p>It should be an uphill battle though, as conference rivals Cal Poly, Hawai’i and UC Irvine finished last season with conference records of 15-1, 14-2 and 10-6 respectively.</p>\n<p>An eleven-game stretch near the start of the season features one matchup with Irvine and two with Hawai’i, as well as two Blue-Green rivalries. That means five of those eleven games will be against last year’s top three conference teams including UCSB’s archrival. This stretch also features two matchups with UC Davis and two with Long Beach State, the two schools who finished just below UCSB in the Big West standings. UCSB split the two-game series with both schools last year.</p>\n<p>This stretch will almost guarantee UCSB’s position as an elite club or expose the team as a one-season wonder.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to be especially careful not to let their emotions get the best of them in the games against Cal Poly, as the Mustangs’ defense was frustrating to play against last year and their offense was efficient.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s Torrey Van Winden led the Big West in hitting percentage at .365 while teammate Meredith Phillips was ranked fourth with a .328. The Big West’s leader in blocks per set was also led by Mustang Madilyn Mercer who posted a 1.12. Not a single Gaucho was in the top five of either category.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s stingy defense and crazy efficient offense catapulted them to a 15-1 conference record and a 25-3 overall.</p>\n<p>Individual efforts were the premier highlights for the Gauchos in 2018-19, and they will be looking to put it all together into team success this season. The Blue-Green matchup will showcase some of the league’s best talents as well the Big West’s fiercest rivalry. Each game will be a must-watch.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos begin the season on Friday, Aug. 23 with a home scrimmage against CSU Bakersfield.

On the ‘Chos second possession of the game, sophomore utility Sarah Snyder was able to find the back of the net to give UCSB an early 1-0 lead over the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>Less than 30 seconds later, Hawaii would respond with a goal from Junior utility Femke Aan, giving her 34 goals on the year to knot the game up at 1-1.</p>\n<p>With momentum on their side, the Rainbow Wahine were able to score another goal as freshman utility Carmen Baringo netted her first of two goals on the day to give Hawaii a 2-1 lead going into the second period.</p>\n<p>Hawaii would dominate the second period as they not only scored three goals but also did not allow UCSB to score a goal in the entire period, which put the halftime score at 5-1 in favor of the Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>In the third period, Santa Barbara and Hawaii would both score on two straight possessions each to make things interesting after two goals from Simmons and junior utility Sarah Kreiser for the ‘Chos and two goals for Hawaii from redshirt senior utility Chloe Barr to put the game at 7-3. Barr would score another goal later in the period, giving her five goals on the match and 42 on the year.</p>\n<p>With the score at 9-3 in favor of Hawaii to start the fourth period, UCSB would look to find some offensive rhythm to build upon for their match against the Aggies, just a day later.</p>\n<p>Junior center Emily Martin was able to end the scoring drought for Santa Barbara as she scored with just one minute left in the game. The Rainbow Wahine added two more goals in the period and the game ended with a final score of 11-4.</p>\n<p>Just 24 hours later, the Gauchos were back in the pool as they faced a red-hot Aggies squad, that is currently 18-9 overall on the year, with a 3-2 conference record. This game was the last regular season home game for Santa Barbara which meant that it was the last time senior defender Annie Mortimer would suit up for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Mortimer came into the game with five goals and six assists on the year and looked to get a win in her last home game for the ‘Chos.</p>\n<p>In the first period, sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder would start off strong for Santa Barbara as she had two early saves.</p>\n<p>On a power play with 3:54 remaining in the period, Simmons netted her first goal of the day off of a pass from Mortimer giving UCSB an early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>UC Davis did not have any offensive rhythm in the first period and looked to change that as the second period started. Just a minute into the period, sophomore attacker Kathleen Schafle would tie the game up for the Aggies.</p>\n<p>After a couple of defensive stands from both teams, Kreiser would score for the Gauchos giving them a one-goal advantage. Junior utility Annie Kutt would net her only goal of the game for UC Davis to lock things up at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder would later score with two minutes remaining in the second period as she launched a ball over UC Davis’ keeper but once again Schafle would score for the Aggies, putting the score at 3-3 going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Mortimer would start things off in the second half by scoring her first goal of the game which ignited the crowd at the Newport Beach Native was not only able to put a goal away on her senior day but also give Santa Barbara the lead.</p>\n<p>After the game was tied at five goals apiece, Simmons and Sophomore Attacker Natalie Selin would each net goals to give UCSB a 7-5 lead heading into the fourth period.</p>\n<p>Simmons would complete her hat trick in the fourth period off of a great pass from Sarah Snyder on a fast break and after two crucial saves from Kenzi Snyder, Kreiser would put the game away with a goal that put the final score at 9-5.</p>\n<p>Simmons led the way for the ‘Chos as she finished the weekend with four goals, three steals, and one assist.</p>\n<p>Despite not being the biggest in the pool, Simmons continues to find ways to make a positive impact on her team.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I am not a big player,” Simmons stated. “I have to use my mobility and speed to get goals.”</p>\n<p>With this marking Mortimer’s last regular season for the ‘Chos, she ended up finishing in style with one goal and two assists.</p>\n<p>“This is definitely bittersweet,” Mortimer stated. “It feels really good to go out on a win and I think that was one of our best games of the season. We all played really well together and everyone contributed which made it a great game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to continue their momentum from this weekend as they head into the conference tournament in two weeks.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will head to Irvine on April 27th where their opponent has yet to be determined to compete in the Big West Tournament.</p><div

A real character building road trip,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “Our confidence is getting good again, and we are ready to get some nice wins at home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their first opponent, Lewis, holds a 5-2 record but has not defeated any team that is currently ranked, and their two losses have come against No. 3 UC Irvine and No. 6 Pepperdine. Loyola-Chicago has a 5-1 overall record and, despite a loss to UCI, the Ramblers upset Pepperdine back on Jan. 18 in a five-set thriller.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all teams having five wins, Santa Barbara’s road to that success has been a lot tougher considering that their last five matches have come against ranked opponents and they own the toughest schedule in the nation with their remaining opponents boasting a combined win percentage of .717. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, even though 5-3 is a good record, the Gauchos know they could be in a better position and have to play well in their upcoming games if they want to overcome their gruesome schedule. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have the top schedule in the country and its because we want to be playing tough teams and get better to be ready when the playoffs come,” McLaughlin said. “We could easily be 6-2, if not 7-1, but that’s the way it goes. Sometimes it is better to lose so we can work a bit harder.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is 5-5 all-time against Lewis and has lost three straight meetings to the Flyers, including a 3-1 defeat in Illinois last season. If the Gauchos want to change their fortunes this time around, then they will need to find a way to break through a tough Flyer defense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lewis holds the 12th best opponent hitting percentage in the nation holding them to a .200 clip. The Flyers also average nearly 10 digs per set, fifth-best mark in the country, and three blocks per set, second-best mark in the country. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means UCSB will need to have an efficient, aggressive offensive showing and also need a big game from some of its offensive leaders such as senior outside hitter, Corey Chavers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chavers leads the team in kills per set averaging 3.29 and has amassed 102 total kills thus far in the year. No other Gaucho has more than 50, meaning that the team has a nice balance with Chavers leading the charge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fellow teammate junior Keenan Sanders had a career day against Lewis last season finishing with a career-high 24 kills in that match. A repeat performance of that could put the Gauchos over the top. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offensively, Lewis is very team-oriented, with five players averaging two kills per set and no player having more than 66 kills in total.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are 2-1 all-time against Loyola-Chicago, losing for the first time last season, 3-1. Offensively, UCSB will need a similar game plan considering the Ramblers hold their opponents hitting percentage to just .174, ranking sixth in the nation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season when these two teams met, Chavers led the team with 18 kills, but the next closest Gaucho only had nine apiece. More even distribution will be a big key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes Loyola-Chicago even tougher, however, is that its offense is even better than its defense. As a team, the Ramblers average 13.86 kills per set, .363 hitting percentage and 12.68 assists per set. Those averages are the No. 2, No. 3 and No. 5 ranks in the country, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior outside hitter Collin Mahan is one of the biggest forces in the Rambler offense. The New York native recently was honored with the MIVA Offensive Player of the Week award thanks to a 28 kill performance in his team’s last two outings, including the upset win against Pepperdine where Mahan registered 18 kills on an efficient .309 hitting. This comes as no surprise as Mahan was also picked as the Preseason MIVA Player of the Year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defensively, UCSB will need to rely on Senior libero Hayden Boehle who leads the team with 78 digs while Sanders leads the team with 25 blocks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, this weekend will be important for Santa Barbara to make some noise on a national level in the shadows of the bigger Big West teams. Currently, the top three spots in national rankings belong to Big West teams. If UCSB wants to be there, they will need to prove it with some big wins at home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is always good to be at Rob Gym and I love playing teams ranked above us. They give us the challenge we need to get better and our guys will be ready,” McLaughlin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes on Lewis at 7 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 25 at Robertson Gym. The match against Loyola-Chicago will be on Saturday, Jan. 26 at the same time and location.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Sophomore utility Sarah Snyder led the way with four goals while freshman goalkeeper Becca Buck had six saves in front of the cage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In their previous matchup, which dates back to last season, Hawaii won 8-3 behind a high-powered offense that averaged 10 goals per game.</p>\n<p>Hawaii has won six of their last seven games by an average margin of seven goals.</p>\n<p>They last played against No. 14 Long Beach State in their last home game of the season and won by a score of 12-6. Sophomore utility Maartje Keuning led the way as she netted four goals, giving her 36 on the year.</p>\n<p>Junior Irene Gonzales netted a hat trick on the game as well, adding to her team-leading record of 49 goals, which also leads the Big West.</p>\n<p>It will be crucial for the ‘Chos to limit the amount of chances Hawaii has on goal by continuing to stay consistent with their defensive energy throughout the entire game.</p>\n<p>“Hawaii has very good shooters,” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “I think they have a lot of fire power so we are going to need to be able to really lock down on defense and get some good shot blocks.”</p>\n<p>As winners of seven of their last 10 games, UC Davis will look to continue their hot streak by relying primarily on their potent offense as they average 11 goals per game on the year.</p>\n<p>The Aggies were last in action this past weekend when they won a thriller against No. 9 UC Irvine. Senior center Greta Kohlmoos had a hat trick on the day while sophomore goalkeeper Caitlin Golding had seven saves.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to have success against UC Davis, it will be crucial for the ‘Chos to slow down junior utility Annie Kutt, who leads the team with 73 points on the year, consisting of 32 goals and 41 assists.</p>\n<p>Despite struggling on offense in the prior two games before CSUN, Santa Barbara seems to have found their rhythm offensively, primarily due to the play of Snyder.</p>\n<p>Snyder comes into this game as the third-leading goal scorer in the conference. With 45 goals on the year, she has already passed last year’s personal scoring record by 10 goals and still has two regular season games as well as the Big West Tournament to add to it.</p>\n<p>“She has been inspiring,” Kay stated. “I think it is important for her to realize that she does lead our team and there is a target on her back, which makes it a little more challenging for herself but that will lead to other people being open.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, freshman attacker Mollie Simmons continues her diverse level of play in terms of goals, sprints and steals. The San Jose native currently has 17 goals and 33 steals on the year and has consistently won sprints to start off the period and give the Gauchos early momentum.</p>\n<p>“She is only a freshman and I think there is such room for growth from her,” Kay said. “I am excited for what is going to come in the future.”</p>\n<p>Both Buck and sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder continue to split time in front of the cage and will look to continue their dominance as of late. With 10 saves and two steals combined in their last game, they have made it extremely difficult for opponents to find the back of the net.</p>\n<p>“I think their presence was good,” Kay said. “They have been communicating very well and that is something we have been focusing on.”</p>\n<p>With just two games remaining before the Big West Tournament, UCSB will look to increase their seed in the Big West Standings as they are currently in fifth place. If they win both games, they will put themselves in a great position to secure at least a top-three seed in the tournament.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to add on to their one-game win streak as they host both Hawaii and Davis this weekend in Santa Barbara at 12 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 12th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82392\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-17-ucsb-celebrates-senior-day-hosts-hawaii-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82392\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-17-ucsb-celebrates-senior-day-hosts-hawaii-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-17-ucsb-celebrates-senior-day-hosts-hawaii-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-17-ucsb-celebrates-senior-day-hosts-hawaii-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-17-ucsb-celebrates-senior-day-hosts-hawaii-uc-davis/","id":5586,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[5585,5584,5583],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
