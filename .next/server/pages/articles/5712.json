Many members of our community spend days out on the sea surfing, walking their pets or unwinding after a long day of classes. However, the beauty and environmental safety of our community is currently under the threat of attack by the Cat Canyon proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We, Alexandra Leal Silva and Gordon Hahn, strongly oppose the proposed construction of approximately 750 more oil wells in Northern Santa Barbara County’s Cat Canyon. Currently, three oil companies — ERG Resources, Aera Energy and Petro Rock — are working together to convince county authorities to allow this project near the towns of Garey and Sisquoc. This plan falls short of development and will instead threaten the people of Santa Barbara county with pollution, environmental degradation and a heightened specter of oil spills.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"87068\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/standard_oil_co-_wells_near_pawee_oklahoma/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma.jpg?fit=2048%2C1589&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1589\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Standard_Oil_Co._wells,_near_Pawee,_Oklahoma\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma.jpg?fit=250%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma.jpg?fit=888%2C689&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-87068\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma-1024x795.jpg?resize=888%2C689\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma.jpg?resize=1024%2C795&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma.jpg?resize=250%2C194&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma.jpg?resize=768%2C596&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Standard_Oil_Co._wells_near_Pawee_Oklahoma.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This proposal is so energy and water intensive that it has been ranked among the <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/blog/2018/11/schoolhouse-meeting-highlights-risks-750-new-oil-wells-santa\">top 10% of carbon-intensive projects in the world</a>. The oil wells would use the “steam fracking” method which relies heavily on vast amounts of water and natural gas. To supply this gas, new pipelines would have to be constructed along highways 101 and 135. The oil wells would use the gas to heat the water to steam in order to loosen the thick crude oil from the ground. This process requires an estimated seven to eight million gallons of freshwater. Amidst California’s ever-present specter of drought, it does not have the freshwater resources nor the appetite for risk to follow through with such a commitment.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, this oil scheme threatens the ecological health and air quality of Santa Barbara County’s ecosystems. <a href=\"https://lompocrecord.com/news/local/meeting-focuses-on-risks-of-three-proposed-oil-developments-in/article_986069b1-e75e-527d-b1fe-d6d66be0bacf.html\">Aera Energy’s project</a> alone would require bulldozing 300 acres of land, moving three million cubic feet of earth and uprooting 1,500 oak trees. This would destroy the habitats and even lives of animals and plants, hurting our precious ecosystems.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On top of these disastrous changes, the mere functioning of these oil wells would increase the amount of fossil fuel pollutants into the air. The wells generate high amounts of particulate matter, specifically toxic hydrogen sulfide. Also, <a href=\"https://lompocrecord.com/news/local/meeting-focuses-on-risks-of-three-proposed-oil-developments-in/article_986069b1-e75e-527d-b1fe-d6d66be0bacf.html\">the proposal would bring an additional 156 oil tanker trips per day</a> to local roadways, polluting more carbon emission gases.  Finally, the oil production process involves toxic chemicals, including benzene, toluene, xylene and many others, <a href=\"https://lompocrecord.com/news/local/meeting-focuses-on-risks-of-three-proposed-oil-developments-in/article_986069b1-e75e-527d-b1fe-d6d66be0bacf.html\">which can impact hormone production and cause cancer and birth defects</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The most insidious danger of this plan is the certainty of an oil spill. Spills are not just possible but expected. The Environmental Impact Reports for the wells anticipate spills from both wells and pipelines. As of 2017, there were as many as <a href=\"http://www.sbcan.org/issues_maps\">60 active investigations</a> of petroleum contamination being conducted by Sisquoc and Guadalupe. ERG itself estimates <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/blog/2018/11/schoolhouse-meeting-highlights-risks-750-new-oil-wells-santa\">18 spills over the next 10 years</a>. This estimation echoes the company’s track record, having been responsible for 21 oil spills between 2011 and 2015, resulting in over <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/blog/2018/11/schoolhouse-meeting-highlights-risks-750-new-oil-wells-santa\">20,000 gallons of spilled crude</a>.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The Cat Canyon proposal will certainly damage our already-strained environment and endanger the residents of Santa Barbara County.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These <a href=\"http://350sb.org/no-new-oil-wells/\">spills will endanger the Santa Maria Valley Groundwater Basin</a>, the major source of freshwater for 200,000 people in 12 cities, including Santa Maria, Orcutt and Guadalupe. The most glaring threat of this project is that it will be constructed just 1,900 feet, <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/blog/2018/11/schoolhouse-meeting-highlights-risks-750-new-oil-wells-santa\">less than a mile, from Benjamin Foxen Elementary School</a> in Sisquoc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While oil construction projects are usually framed as creating jobs, the cost of oil and contaminant cleanup can be prodigious. The most recent of the catastrophic oil spills took place only a few years ago in 2015. The Refugio Oil Spill cost taxpayers about $100 million in clean up. Taxpayers and the local community bear the burden of paying the additional damage to ecosystems, loss of animal and plant life and closures of recreational areas.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One would think that Santa Barbara would know better about increasing the presence and of oil corporations; only 50 years ago, our county suffered the disastrous and infamous 1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill. This calamity brought our community together in tackling the influence of oil companies in our democratic institutions. From this low point, the people of Santa Barbara sparked the epicenter of the modern environmentalist movement, which has only benefited our country with environmental health and sustainable economic growth. It is important to recall this history in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. We stand with our fellow residents and organizations that oppose this empty and dangerous project. The Cat Canyon proposal will certainly damage our already-strained environment and endanger the residents of Santa Barbara County.<br><br><em>Students interested in these ongoing efforts can email

There’s something irreplaceable about this aspect of learning. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2020, everything changed due to COVID-19. I have spent 95% of my time during the past two and a half months indoors in my apartment in Isla Vista. COVID-19 has forced an evolution to remote learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote learning is efficient, or at least it was intended to be. The idea is simple: By cutting out some of the unnecessary parts of daily life at a university, such as commuting and coming and going from class to class, we save time. It is meant to be a direct connection to knowledge and professors. Yet my experience is that there are a lot more factors to take into account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, not going to school breaks the psychological state of studying. Rolling out of bed and opening my 32-inch display screen, which I also use to watch YouTube and play games, doesn’t make me feel like studying. I try my best to avoid using my laptop for leisure during the day, but it’s unavoidable. It requires much persistence to stay focused. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is simple: By cutting out some of the unnecessary parts of daily life at a university, such as commuting and coming and going from class to class, we save time.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compare this to sitting in a classroom, which is quiet and has hundreds of people around you studying. Even if you drift away for a bit, you usually come right back to focus because it “feels” like the right thing to do. As far as efficiency is concerned, while cutting back some inefficient activities, remote learning also introduces new ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, because it is more or less a forced change, a lot of details have not been figured out. For example, many lecturers are not used to writing on a tablet and screen recording, so now, they make videos talking over prepared slides. As a result, students can no longer see the steps of derivation, and they lose their natural signs and annotation in graphics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue is with homework grading. The process usually involves students handing homework into a collection box before a deadline; then, the TA would collect them and distribute them to graders. Now, many classes use the GauchoSpace built-in function, which is, to put it mildly, bad for anything that requires stepped grading and commentary. Luckily, some commercial solutions exist, and many classes in S.T.E.M. subjects are utilizing them. It is impressive to see classes quickly learning to use these new tools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, I think COVID-19 has forced innovation and exploration on the individual level, and remote learning will be a good thing in the long run. We are prepared to find a new way of living and learning with more resilience.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Jerry Ling</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hitherto, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has already</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> surpassed 2 million in America</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which represents </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over a quarter of the known cases</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the world. As the most powerful country with access to some of the best medical care and most advanced technologies, it is worth considering why there are a rising number of cases in the U.S. because this pandemic affects not only the overall economy of the nation, but also every one of us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I appreciate that UCSB had changed its teaching mode to online before the coronavirus was widely spread. With this opportunity, I have returned to my home country, where the situation is mostly under control. Thanks to my professors, I do not have to stay up late to participate in live meetings because of my current time zone. In hindsight, I believe that although remote learning does have its deficiencies, it is undoubtedly an effective measure under these unusual circumstances.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, I believe that although remote learning does have its deficiencies, it is undoubtedly an effective measure under these unusual circumstances.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have been successful in keeping our classes up and running by leveraging our technology. Besides some of the negative experiences that remote learning may bring us, I think that it can also benefit us in many ways. For example, students save time they would normally spend commuting, therefore freeing up more time for focusing on their studies. They are also able to watch the recorded lectures repeatedly to strengthen any points in their classes they do not understand. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we have had to abandon face-to-face conversations, I think this is an acceptable change. Nothing is more important than our collective safety. Turning to the discussion on online examinations, I do want to stress that teachers should be more flexible and considerate with students. We are all uneasy because of the current circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From my point of view, remote lecturing has been quite successful at UCSB. However, I am suspicious about the assertion that students can return to the campus in September. Although I have complete faith in UCSB’s resilience, I believe it is too early to make decisions. The situation seems to be persistent and since this type of lecturing is working, I think we should continue to learn online in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><em>– Robert Chen</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid problems like Internet connectivity and time zone differences, I chose to remain in Santa Barbara during this period of remote learning. I was pretty optimistic about the epidemic at the time, and I thought that the situation would surely improve before summer vacation. So, I rented a house with my friend in Goleta and was ready to get used to this new learning method. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, spring quarter did not proceed as successfully as I anticipated. As a pre-chem student, I had to take two labs this quarter. It was very inconvenient to conduct both of the lab courses in an online format. Students had no access to manipulate data and make measurements by ourselves. Although TAs would record experiment videos for us, the experiments were not conducted by our own hands, and there were always some problems that we could not understand. We had to repeatedly stop and ask questions when finishing our lab reports, which was time-consuming. In addition, the lab manuals were partly revised because of the online learning. In one class, we needed to spend an extra two to three hours to complete each lab report. It seemed we did not truly grasp the knowledge we needed to learn in labs, and we wasted a lot of time.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope that my flight in June will not be cancelled and that I will be able to get back to my family.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did see some positive results from online learning. Many of my courses were recorded. This meant that I could choose when to study according to my habits. I did not have to get up early to catch the bus to campus and have to feel tired. I obtained a lot more sleep than I usually have and was more energetic when studying. In this way, online learning was helpful; however, I found I was not disciplined at home without a structured campus schedule. It was hard to be persistent with online learning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 virus outbreak turned out to be much worse than I expected. I hope that our in-person interactions will return as soon as possible. My roommate got a flight to return home two weeks ago, so I am the only one left in the house. The air tickets are very expensive and difficult to purchase now. I hope that my flight in June will not be cancelled and that I will be able to get back to my family.</span></p>\n<p>– <em>Candace Chen</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-95010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-95010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-30/international-students-on-the-transition-to-remote-learning/","id":5709,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[5708,5707,5706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor | The Man, The Myth, The Dude","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2019-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11035292_10206443332907235_4570200954519665863_n-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11035292_10206443332907235_4570200954519665863_n-1.jpg?resize=946%2C623&ssl=1","description":"Steve McDonough, owner of Coffee Collaborative, passed away on Feb. 26.

He thrived on cultural trivia, arguments for the sake of debate and, most of all, plucky banter with his friends. After attending grad school at Georgetown, Steve traveled the world, bouncing from destination to destination, only to land at his final stop in Isla Vista. He had always been focused academically on math and science, but once he moved to I.V., he blossomed into the artsy-fartsy, free-spirited philosopher we all came to love. Then, with a few good friends and a strong peer group at his side, Steve opened a coffee shop called the Coffee Collaborative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Collab, as it was fondly addressed, was an offbeat and quirky shop on the corner of Pardall and Embarcadero. Never having been much of a businessman, Steve ignored traditional corporate tactics and, instead, transformed the Collab into a creative, alternative space. Although it didn’t seem exceptional to some, it was everything to its employees, regulars, locals and passersby. This became the home of debates, late-night talks, laughter, chess and community. It also became, perhaps infamously, a refuge for the lost, alcoholic, homeless and the poor. Regardless of how it was perceived from the outside, the Collab was always a place of belonging and forgiveness and was never a place for judgement — that was all Steve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One might even say that Steve was the purveyor of wayward souls. Perhaps he was so accepting of others because he, at heart, was a lost soul too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve was certainly not a hero, but he touched the lives of many young people; he spurred intellectual conflict, wafted at the edges of his beliefs and challenged those around him to do the same. Aside from being a philosopher, he was also an absurd comic and a wild storyteller. And although he was plagued by darkness, you’d never know it at the sound of his distinctive and well-loved laugh; it had a depth to it, came straight from the belly and would make you laugh along with him just at the sound of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like The Dude from “The Big Lebowski,” Steve always seemed to be caught up in some new fantasy or adventure. However aimless he seemed, his life was never dull and he was always able to find some sort of trouble or mischief. For those who knew him best, Steve was a complex, infectious and influential man full of love and turmoil. Whether he knew it or not, Steve was always surrounded by loved ones through his ups and downs, which was perhaps his greatest blessing. He will always be remembered by those who loved him as a staple, or perhaps a reflection, of Isla Vista and their time here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was and always will be a colorful thread in the fabric of our lives. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87176\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87176\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-the-man-the-myth-the-dude/","id":5710,"author":{"id":384,"name":"Opinion Editor"},"related":[5709,5708,5707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Letter to the Editor | In Opposition of Divestment","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2019-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LMB_2190.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LMB_2190.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sarah Mehrnia argues that A.S. Senate should not divest from Israel. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tomorrow, the Associated Students Senate at UCSB will vote on a proposed resolution to divest from companies that have ties to Israel. This resolution is part of the broader Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. BDS is an international movement that seeks to destroy, defame, and delegitimize the only Jewish state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone whose parents found a home in Israel after fleeing religious persecution during the Iranian Revolution, I feel directly targeted by this resolution. My family’s experience does not stand alone. Many Jewish Israelis are people of color who came from Middle Eastern countries where their families faced persecution and discrimination, and Israel was the only place where they could find refuge. The descendants of these refugees make up the vibrant and diverse society that is Israel. For us, Israel is a safe haven and the embodiment of our liberation. This resolution attempts to erase this history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I, like many supporters of Israel, believe there is room to criticize the state. In fact, it is open criticism of Israel that makes it stronger and a true democracy. There are legitimate ways to criticize Israel, and there are ways to express these criticisms without erasing my people’s narrative and history. This resolution is not that way.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of advancing a one-sided resolution, we should be supporting initiatives that promote a better life for Palestinians and Israelis. Instead of divesting, we should be investing in collaboration and coexistence. Instead of dictating a political solution to a faraway conflict, we should be coming together to bridge our gaps and better understand one another here at UCSB. This resolution impedes progress towards justice and the goal of peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. It promotes a dangerous pattern that divides our campus, stifles dialogue, and creates a hostile atmosphere at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We, as students at such a highly esteemed university, have the power to enact real and important change. It is dangerous and morally irresponsible, however, to pass a resolution that erases a whole group of people’s narrative and history. I urge you to do your research and understand all sides of this issue. I urge ASUCSB and my fellow Gauchos to come together with open minds and find a more productive way forward.</span></p>\n<p><i>Sarah Mehrnia encourages the 69th Senate not to divest from Israel.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-in-opposition-of-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-in-opposition-of-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-in-opposition-of-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-in-opposition-of-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-09/letter-to-the-editor-in-opposition-of-divestment/","id":5711,"author":{"id":385,"name":"Sarah Mehrnia"},"related":[5710,5709,5708],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
