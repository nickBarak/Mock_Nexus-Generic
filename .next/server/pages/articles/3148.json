Finance Board allocation during last night’s three-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>The council conferred about the 1993 Smith v. Regents court case, which prohibited the use of student fees in lobbying for any particular political proposition or candidate. With that in mind, the A.S. Finance Board decided not to fund CalPIRG’s “Vote Float” parade during last Monday’s meeting for fear that the organization might align itself to a certain politician or cause.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, the aforementioned legislation strictly regulates the manner in which college student governments can regulate funds.</p>\n<p>“It has been a requirement for elected students to ensure that they don’t support a candidate,” Marquez said. “You all receive honoraria so we can’t endorse candidates for that reason. Individuals in their own name can make an opinion about something, but they aren’t allowed to attach it to their office.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the council debated whether T-shirts produced with student funds should be manufactured by a single company in order to establish a standard rate and save money for A.S. in the long run.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Jamie Silverstein said the council’s budget gives representatives no choice but to lower its expectations for T-shirts they commission.</p>\n<p>“We need to be sure T-shirts are made in an environmentally aware manner and ensure that they will be cost effective, but these two things go in different directions,” Silverstein said. “The group needs to decide if they want cheap prices or environmentally made T-shirts. The group needs to decide what they want out of their T-shirts.”</p>\n<p>However, Off-campus Representative Jason Lopez said A.S. shouldn’t limit student organizations’ options by binding them to one shirt manufacturer.</p>\n<p>“A lot of groups on campus already have a partnership with different companies,” Lopez said. “They may already get cheaper prices there and if we make them go somewhere else we might make them spend more money than they would have otherwise.”</p>\n<p>The board eventually tabled the discussion.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Representative Chloe Stryker said she was concerned that A.S. Finance Board is likely to run out of funds for the quarter.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to do,” Stryker said. “We could take away from winter [quarter’s unallocated fund] or just give away all our money in the next two meetings. If you know people that have events in Fall Quarter, have them come in as soon as possible because it’s going to become difficult to fund those groups.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27838\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27838\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/political-events-spur-debate-fund-allocation/","id":3148,"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin"},"related":[3147,3146,3145],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":211,"name":"Erika Martin","biography":"Not available","articles":[3133,3134,3136,3148,3149,3150,3162],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Good to Be Bad","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If you are in a fantasy baseball league that isn’t rotisserie style, you’re doing it wrong.

In rotisserie play, you gain points based on how well you do in the various scoring categories compared to the rest of the teams in your league. If you do better in a category than your opponents, you gain points. If you do worse, you lose points. How you rank in the individual categories also affects how you obtain points. For instance, if you are ranked No. 1 in a certain category, you won’t gain any points for doing well in that category because you’re already ranked first. You can’t do any better in that category.</p>\n<p>While fair to those with good players and a balanced team, the system can make those owners who rely heavily on either pitching or hitting see red.</p>\n<p>Take my team for example. My pitching is absolutely outstanding. Marlins pitcher Josh Johnson is the Gandalf of the MLB with his absurdly low 0.65 WHIP and the Phillies’ Roy Halladay has humiliated hitters whenever he takes the mound. The rest of my staff — which includes Red Sox ace Jon Lester and Padres’ closer Heath Bell — isn’t too shabby either.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum is my hitting. It’s not that I have bad hitters. My team includes Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre, Arizona shortstop Stephen Drew and third baseman David Freese of the Cardinals. However, the rest of my lineup has begun the season mired in a slump. While I am first or near first in every pitching category, I’m wallowing near the bottom of most hitting categories. Logic would say that my outstanding pitching would at least counter my tear-inducing hitting, but logic would be wrong.</p>\n<p>Because my pitching is so good, it is almost impossible for me gain points from it since I’m already beating the rest of the league in those categories.  Even if I get three wins and 20 strikeouts on any given day, it won’t matter. It’s like being the person who sets the curve on a test. You don’t really benefit because you would have gotten the top grade anyway. The only way I can really gain points is through my hitting, since that is where I have room to improve. But since my hitting sucks so much right now, I rarely ever do better than the people ahead of me in the standings and I rarely ever gain enough points to move up. It’s like ESPN is punishing me for being so awesome at drafting pitchers.</p>\n<p>In fantasy baseball, being the best is bad unless you’re the best at everything (but we all know that’s not true, because if you were you wouldn’t be reading this). If you’re mediocre at everything, then you have both the potential and the capacity to improve as the season goes on. However, if you are the best in a few categories and horrible in others, you are likely going to be stuck in the middle of the pack for the entirety of the season. You won’t quite have the worst team in the league, but having one of the best teams will always be slightly out of your reach.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s good to be bad sometimes. I know its counterintuitive, but just look at George Thorogood. That dude is bad to the bone, but he has tons of money.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Daily Nexus fantasy sports columnist Josh</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/","id":3145,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[3144,3143,3142],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fees Return for Approval, Crowd Ballot","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Various campus programs and organizations are asking for the reaffirmation of 31 separate lock-in fees totaling to about $552 per year in the upcoming Spring Election.

In order to receive continued funding, the initiatives must secure a successful re-vote from the campus community every two years. Students can vote for A.S. candidates, new lock-in fees and reaffirmations via GOLD from April 18 at 8 a.m. until April 21 at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Advisor Aaron Jones, the A.S. associate director for community affairs, said lock-in fees were established ‘by the students, for the students’ to alleviate university-wide budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“The lock-ins were proposed and voted on by students, so over the past couple of years, when the money has dried up throughout the university, the students voted to instill a lock-in to save these types of programs,” Jones said. “Right now, things are really tight and students are being asked to bear more of the burden, but supporting the reaffirmations will not increase student fees because they are already locked in. [The reaffirmations] are great because the students can physically see the benefit.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1) KCSB/KJUC requests the reaffirmation of a $2.80 fee per student per quarter and $2.90 fee for summer. Of the total, $0.40 would be allotted for financial aid. KCSB/KJUC is a community-oriented radio station funded primarily by students that broadcasts from campus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2) A.S. Communication Personnel, which is employed by KCSB, seeks a $4.92 fee per student per quarter and $4.17 fee for summer. Of the total, $0.67 would be allocated to financial aid.

Program Board calls for the approval of a continued $11.50 fee per student per quarter, $1.50 of which would be allotted for financial aid.</p>\n<p>ASPB Commissioner Rae Yamamoto said the board provides student amenities like free Tuesday night movies and low-priced concerts. Notable ASPB acts have included The Killers, Nas, Fleet Foxes, Cascada, Three 6 Mafia and Ludacris.</p>\n<p>“If you think about it, for $12 you can go see a movie once, but for [less than] $12 a quarter you can go to nine movie screenings and much more,” Yamamoto said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4) The UC Student Association seeks a continued $3.02 fee per student per quarter and $2.90 fee for summer, $0.67 of which would be distributed to financial aid.

We try to keep our prices at or below other shops to help out.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>7) Community Affairs Board requests a $2.62 fee per student per quarter and $2.24 fee for summer, $0.37 of which would be allotted for financial aid.

The association provides I.V. residents a resource to seek council when troubled by housing issues or landlords.</p>\n<p>Chair Sara Vandenbelt said the organization is completely free to I.V. residents and attempts to punctually and effectively help local tenants.</p>\n<p>“Tenants are too easily taken advantage of and IVTU is there to help when you have problems, but because we do exist we really do keep these problems at bay in the first place,” Vandenbelt said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>14) The A.S. Legal Resource Center asks students to reaffirm a fee of $1.90 per student per quarter and $1.40 for summer, $0.10 of which would be allotted for financial aid.

Council Debates UC Budget Concerns","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students Legislative Council discussed issues ranging from student fees to the campus voter registration drive at last night’s three-hour meeting.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Associated Students Legislative Council discussed issues ranging from student fees to the campus voter registration drive at last night’s three-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>Despite allotting a seemingly generous $3 billion to the UC system in his 2010-11 state budget, council members voiced concern that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s allocation wasn’t enough to lift the University out of its financial deficit. According to A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Doug Wagoner, UCSB will still face a $439.9 million shortfall in 2011-12.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Wagoner said UC VP of Budget Patrick Lenz alluded to future fee hikes for UC students during a UC Student Association board meeting over the weekend.</p>\n<p>“[Lenz] danced around the fact that there’s probably going to be a 20 percent student fee increase in November and he also didn’t answer any of our questions very well,” Wagoner said. “I encourage you all to research more into the budget to see where the money’s going in our dire state.”</p>\n<p>The council also discussed the 1993 court case Smith v. Regents, which prohibits the use of student fees to lobby any proposition or candidate. A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez cautioned the council to remember its expenses are regularly audited in compliance with Smith v. Regents.</p>\n<p>“Taking a position either way on an issue is not a violation of Smith v. Regents,” Marquez said. “What is a violation is spending any student fees to defeat or support any particular proposition or candidate. However, the educational process is not a political process; I’d be putting out the message that we’re investing in the educational mission.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Jason Lopez questioned the legality of funding a group such as the Rock the Vote campaign, if the organization used the money to favor of a local candidate.</p>\n<p>Marquez recommended the council seek her advice when unsure whether an allocation was in line with Smith v. Regents, Off-Campus Representative and Finance Board member Chloe Stryker requested Marquez give a similar talk about the case at Monday’s Finance Board meeting.</p>\n<p>“If you had come and given that presentation [last] Monday, that probably would have changed the outcome a lot,” Stryker said.</p>\n<p>Marquez then went on to discuss the Associated Students’ role in Steve Pappas’ lawsuit against Board of Supervisors Representative Doreen Farr, in which Pappas claimed that the Associated Students had potentially mishandled registration forms during the 2008 election. Though the case was dropped, Pappas has recently appealed the decision.</p>\n<p>“A.S. and the campus itself were subpoenaed as witnesses, and we were compelled to respond,” Marquez said. “We need to comply because the suspicion is that Associated Students was conducting voter registration that wasn’t following election code. We’re potentially involved, and that’s something you should all be aware of.”</p>\n<p>Lastly, Wagoner congratulated UCSA’s recent voter registration effort on campus. As of 11:30 Tuesday night, 5,284 UCSB student voters had registered for the upcoming election. UCSA hopes to register a total of 7,000 voters by the end of the drive on Monday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27406\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27406\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/council-debates-uc-budget-concerns/","id":3147,"author":{"id":216,"name":"Katherine Friedman"},"related":[3146,3145,3144],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
