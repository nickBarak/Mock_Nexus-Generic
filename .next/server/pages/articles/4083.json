I’m from Shanghai and all the city is actually dealing with it pretty well. My dad resumed working in mid-February and we know that the peak is already passed,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do believe it is safer in China than the U.S. It’s not even a government problem. People in the U.S. don’t even have the awareness to wear a mask or anything like that. So I felt a bit concerned [staying in the U.S.].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International students at UCSB have faced a unique set of difficulties in keeping up with coursework during the coronavirus pandemic. The switch to remote learning forced students to quickly decide whether to stay in Santa Barbara or go to their home countries, a hardship that domestic students did not have to navigate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-19/majority-of-fall-quarter-classes-to-be-held-remotely-tuition-and-student-fees-will-not-change/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB recently unveiled its plan for hybrid instruction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Fall Quarter 2020, some uncertainty still looms for international students, whose options for the upcoming quarter make the decision between home and UCSB more complicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email outlining fall quarter protocols, Chancellor Henry T. Yang announced that all first-year international students will have the option to continue with remote curriculum “sufficient for full-time status,” and that “any student who wishes to continue with a full remote offering may do so without being present on or near campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many international students are unsure whether they can get visas renewed to re-enter the U.S., or if coming to the U.S. is the safest option, according to Hak Zheng, a second-year physics major in the College of Creative Studies, currently back home in Japan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I bought a one-way ticket because I’m so uncertain about when I can come back,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m actually not sure if I wanted to come back right now if I’m able to. They might not be allowing any non-citizen people to come in [to the U.S.].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng said it was “obvious” for him to go back to Japan instead of “being by myself in I.V.” He tentatively plans to come back to the U.S. for fall quarter, even if his classes are all online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If fall quarter is still online but the U.S. lets me come back inside, I might consider coming back, just because I do feel like my productivity is low here, so I might decide that I’ve had enough time with my family, now I’m gonna go back to my school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College students across the country, while disconnected from campus and tuning in to lectures over Zoom, have shifted to a “new normal” over the past few months. This adjustment is even greater for international students, who are trying to keep up with classes in a different time zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International students who have chosen to move back home have had to, in some cases, attend lectures and take exams in the middle of the night or early morning. While some professors chose to hold asynchronous classes over the past quarter — which international students could attend to on their own time — there was limited flexibility when it came to exams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng had Zoom lectures at 5 a.m. twice a week for one class and had to take the midterm and final exams at 3 a.m. for another class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students who stayed in the U.S. have their normal time and normal schedule, but we have to do this weird scheduling thing, so the score is not a good reflection of where we are. I don’t know if any professors are going to take that into consideration at all, but that’s just something I’m a little concerned about,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we as human beings need that strict sleep schedule to operate well. I feel like I’m less energetic than usual. But I’m seeing it as something that I just have to deal with for this quarter, hopefully only this quarter, but who knows.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time zone difference between California and home proved to be a major factor in some international students’ decision to remain in the U.S. To avoid the time difference, Aimee Wang — a third-year sociology major from China — decided to stay at a friend’s house in Rancho Cucamonga this quarter after moving out of her sorority house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang ran a successful Associated Students Senate campaign for a College of Letters and Science seat, becoming the first international student elected as senator.  But the demands of the job, from running for her seat to beginning her duties at the end of the quarter, meant moving back to China would have been a “huge hassle,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My friends that I’ve spoken with said they’re not going back to China over the summer because, right now, when we go back, we have to quarantine ourselves,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So it’s kind of a very long process to go back, then spend almost a month [quarantining] by yourself. That may be half of a normal summer break, just to come back to the U.S. and you’d probably have to quarantine yourself again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another obstacle for students moving back to China in particular is that they have to use a virtual private network (VPN) for internet access, which Wang said can be very slow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For international students in China, </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/major-us-tech-companies-blocked-from-operating-in-china-2019-5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students cannot access Google </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or any affiliated websites like Google Docs due to restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have two other CCS physics students who I’m pretty close with, they’re both from China and they did both decided to stay [in the U.S.], and the main reason for them was that they had to deal with the firewall and probably more restrictions in China,” Zheng said, adding that it was a “50-50” split between friends of his who decided to stay in California and who decided to leave. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng also said there’s been a sense of isolation that comes with living over 5,000 miles away from his school and his peers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do feel disconnected from my friends, most of my friends are in the United States, so I mean, they call and they would do homework together, so sometimes they’ll be calling while I’m sleeping, so I do notice that I connect with them a lot less than when I’m back in school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a huge difference between trying to connect with a person through a video call than hanging out in person.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main uncertainty that lies ahead for Wang is fall quarter’s hybrid scenario. She said she’ll be staying in I.V. regardless of whether courses are conducted remotely or not because she wants to experience her senior year there. But she added that a concern for many international students is paying international tuition while missing out on in-person educational benefits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For out-of-state and international students, we pay a lot more for tuition. With the whole online situation, all these changes are already unfair for all the students, but I think it’s even more unfair for international students and out-of-states.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huang said he doesn’t know exactly when he’ll be back in the U.S. But of all the challenges he’s faced this quarter, he said the most difficult and ongoing challenge is the uncertainty that lies ahead for his education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not saying I’m worried about living or anything like that, but mostly learning. Really what most of us are worried about is being able to come back to the U.S. in the fall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Tuition and fees for fall will also remain unchanged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang also said that any student who wishes to continue learning entirely remotely will be given the option to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the email stated that the school would be updating procedures as new safety protocols are released and is “thinking creatively” about face-to-face interaction, currently “all courses with an enrollment of more than 50 students will require remote instruction,” Yang stated in the email.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, classes with less than 50 students have no guarantee of in-person instruction, which will be limited to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small classes, seminars and some arts and performance courses and labs. Decisions about final course formats will be announced in July, Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that the plans for fall quarter instruction are not final, and that the university is working to “develop more face-to-face course offerings.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is also currently planning for all undergraduate residence halls to be limited to double occupancy — with the possibility of limiting rooms to single occupants — reducing the number of housing spaces available to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All students who will be living in campus residences during the 2020-21 school year will be required to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test and the school will be implementing additional safety policies, including limiting social interactions for the first two weeks, enforcing a no-visitor policy and asking students not to travel away from campus during the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student housing will not be impacted by the new social distancing practices and most graduate seminars will be conducted remotely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the hybrid class arrangement, tuition and student fees will not be reduced “r</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">egardless of the method of instruction,” following policies set by the University of California Board of Regents and the UC Office of the President, Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university plans to provide both remote and in-person campus life activities as well as co-curricular programming. These activities will be contingent on new safety practices,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including requiring masks to be worn at all times, performing daily health checks before entering campus, and following social distancing guidelines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email also detailed plans to “bring student-athletes back to campus in preparation for fall competition and the academic year … in alignment with the NCAA’s resocialization action plan for college sports.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang informed students of coronavirus-related research being piloted by UCSB faculty, including “a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research surveillance testing study</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> using a CRISPR-based detection system that is designed to detect COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals,” currently in the development stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The campus is also putting in place a structure that will enable the testing of campus community members who show symptoms of COVID-19 with traditional qPCR testing,” the email continued, also stating that UCSB will be “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">working closely with local public health officials, and will be supporting Public Health’s efforts to conduct contact tracing of campus community members who test positive for COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is also planning to ramp up in-person research projects and “ultimately to get all on-campus research projects underway again at effective levels, while still reducing the number of people working on campus during the pandemic,” Yang wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff not involved in approved on-campus research and currently working from home will continue to work remotely from home during the summer. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.
