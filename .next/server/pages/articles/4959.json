That’s when we started rolling.”</p>\n<p>In the next set, however, Hawaii returned the favor. The visitors came flying out of the gates and took the first seven points of the set, pushing the Gauchos onto their heels from the outset.</p>\n<p>The onslaught continued mostly unabated for a while, as the Rainbow Wahine ran out to a 16-3 lead thanks to a barrage of kills. UCSB managed to stem the flow of blood at that point, and mus red two separate five-point runs to close the gap a little bit, but the deficit was ultimately too large to overcome.</p>\n<p>“Volleyball is a funny game, it comes in waves,” Nicole Welch said. “We were just a little rough early and we had to steady out. You’d think you’d be ready and fired up, but it was just a bit off to start the match.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii managed to hit above 20 percent in all four matches, a major contributing factor to their win on Saturday. Sophomore McKenna Granato led the Rainbow Wahine attack with 21 kills, a typical result for the standout outside hitter, and added 17 digs for a solid double-double.</p>\n<p>“Probably our biggest disappointment (Saturday) was our defensive effort,” Welch said. “That’s been really strong the last week or so and we really didn’t do a good job. We weren’t following our scouting report like we wanted to.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho defense might not have been clicking the way Welch wished, but the team’s service game was almost impeccable. UCSB had a season-high 14 kills, with Hasselmann’s six leading the way.</p>\n<p>“(Hawaii) has a really good middle, so part of our strategy was if we get them out of system, we don’t have to deal with her,” Welch said. “Obviously we wanted to serve aggressively and we were going to be okay with a few errors if we went at them really hard.”</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins led all players Saturday with 23 kills, and the redshirt sophomore chipped in 16 blocks as well for a double-double of her own. It was an excellent performance by any measure for the outside hitter, but one that the reigning National and Big West Player of the Week has managed to make almost ho-hum, a testament to her season-long run of dominance.</p>\n<p>Outside hitter Chloe Allen, who missed eight matches with an injury in the middle of the season, seemed back to full form Saturday evening. The sophomore posted 16 kills, her second-highest total of the season, and provided the Gauchos with a formidable second weapon.</p>\n<p>“Chloe struggled the last week and she really came to life (Saturday),” Welch said. “That’s important for our team, and for our team moving forward, so that was a great plus.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next match is versus Cal Poly at 7:00 p.m. on Friday, November 3 in San Luis Obispo.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79368\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79368\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/","id":4959,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4958,4957,4956],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault","biography":"Not available","articles":[11,39,40,146,167,173,205,236,306,308,309,317,765,767,825,947,951,973,1000,1187,1188,1189,1190,1192,1194,1224,1226,1364,1897,1906,3349,3358,3418,3419,3421,3422,4835,4838,4839,4851,4859,4863,4865,4867,4871,4886,4935,4953,4955,4956,4957,4958,4959,4960,4961,4962,4966,4967,4972,4973,4974,4975,4976,4977,4979,4980,4983,4985,4986,4990,4992,5004,5005,5006,5008,5009,5560,5565,5569,5572,5573,5577,5578],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Look to End Losing Streak at UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FILEPHOTO-WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FILEPHOTO-WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's volleyball team has lost four games in a row and will look to change that against fifth-place UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB and UC Davis women’s volleyball teams are going in opposite directions.</p>\n<p>After losing their last four games, the Gauchos are quickly sinking in the Big West.

It was a disappointing result for Head Coach Nicole Welch’s squad, but there were positive elements to build off of leading into Tuesday’s match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ passing, one of Coach Welch’s points of emphasis leading into Saturday’s match, was much improved against the Mustangs, and UCSB was able to take the first set from a juggernaut Cal Poly squad. The visitors ran off the next three to leave the Thunderdome with a win, but it certainly wasn’t all doom and gloom for the hosts.</p>\n<p>Of course, a hitting percentage of .119 won’t be enough to come away with a win on Tuesday, just like it wasn’t on Saturday. UCSB has cracked .200 in only eight of its 18 games this season, and odds are the Gauchos are going to need to make it nine if they want to have a chance against UCD.</p>\n<p>The Aggies have taken advantage of the Big West bottom-feeders recently, with all three of their consecutive wins coming against the three worst teams in the conference. A win over the sixth-place Gauchos would keep that run going.</p>\n<p>With five players boasting over 100 kills so far this season, the UCD attack is about as balanced as UCSB will see this season. Freshman outside hitter Mahalia White is top of the bunch with 231 kills at a 3.08 per set clip, impressive numbers for a true freshman.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Emily Allen is second to White with 199 kills but possesses a more well-rounded game than her younger counterpart. Allen is tied for third on the team with 14 service aces, and her 209 digs are good enough for second on the Aggie team.</p>\n<p>If White and Allen aren’t enough, UCD can also depend on junior outside hitter Brianna Karseboom, sophomore outside hitter Lauren Matias or junior middle blocker Kelechi Ohiri, all fellow members of the 100-kill club, to bring the thunder on the attack. The depth extends to the setter position as well: junior Maddie Merlino (422 assists) and freshman Paloma Bowman (367) are both reliable passers and conduits for the offense to flow through.</p>\n<p>Davis has hardly been a team of world-beaters this year, but they’ll enter Tuesday’s match with a lot more steam than UCSB. Where the Aggies simply will be looking to maintain their winning ways, the Gauchos must strive to mine the good out of their recent losses while leaving the bad behind.</p>\n<p>The clock is running out on UCSB’s season, but a victory on Tuesday would add a little more much-needed time. That’s going to require the Gauchos to put together a complete effort than they’ve managed to do in the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>UCD hosts UCSB on Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the Pavilion.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79136\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-17/gauchos-look-to-end-losing-streak-at-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79136\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-17/gauchos-look-to-end-losing-streak-at-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-17/gauchos-look-to-end-losing-streak-at-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-17/gauchos-look-to-end-losing-streak-at-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-17/gauchos-look-to-end-losing-streak-at-uc-davis/","id":4956,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4955,4954,4953],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Volleyball Ends its 4-Match Skid with Win over UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WVball_vsCSUN-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WVball_vsCSUN-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos bounced back with a win on the road at UC Davis Tuesday night.

The redshirt sophomore also led UCSB with 15 digs in her sixth double-double match of the season and her second in Big West play.</p>\n<p>Counting Tuesday night, Ruddins has led the Gauchos in kills in 14 of the team’s 19 games, and has done so in every Big West match thus far. Tuesday night’s result was just one of the more extreme occurrences of what has become a major trend for UCSB.</p>\n<p>To be clear, though, the win over the Aggies was not just a one-woman show. Libero Emilia Petrarchi also registered double-digit digs with 10. Petrarchi has finished with at least 10 kills in every game so far this season, a streak that’s landed the junior in the top-50 nationally in digs per set. She enter the weekday match No. 42 in the nation with a 4.94 average.</p>\n<p>Annie Hasselmann had a game-high 40 assists in her role as UCSB’s setter, the player who sets Ruddins up to post her wild statlines. Hasselmann put up a well-balanced statline of five kills, five digs and a service ace to go with her pile of assists, serving as a sort of Swiss Army knife for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB hit at a .242 percentage, the team’s highest rate since its loss to Cal State Northridge on Sept. 9. It was the ninth time the Gauchos cracked the .200 threshold all season. Unsurprisingly, all four of the Gauchos’ wins have come in games they’ve hit at a clip above that mark.</p>\n<p>UC Davis was only a beat behind UCSB in hitting percentage, as the Aggies hit at a .238 clip. That .004 gap, along with the Gauchos’ seven service aces, helped make the difference. UCD had more kills than UCSB in the final set, but the Aggies’ eight errors to Santa Barbara’s four doomed the hosts.</p>\n<p>They might have only needed four sets to take the win, but the Gauchos were never truly comfortable on Tuesday night. Their largest lead was five, which the Aggies promptly turned into a one-point deficit over the next four points.</p>\n<p>The final set was intense and went back-and-forth, with the Gauchos managing only an 18-14 lead as their largest advantage. Just as they had done when down five, UCD quickly cleaned up the deficit, this time tying the match up at 18.</p>\n<p>Both teams played continuously exchanged points down the stretch of that fourth set. Davis managed to take a 23-22 lead, its first advantage since it led 4-3 early on, but UCSB won four of the next five points to clinch the match.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a back-to-back against Long Beach State on Friday, followed by Cal State Northridge on Saturday night. Both games will begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome, and will give the Gauchos two chances to avenge earlier conference losses to both opponents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79172\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79172\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/","id":4957,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4956,4955,4954],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Revamped Gauchos Win Third Straight to End the Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This is a new UCSB women’s volleyball team.

The Gauchos now sit atop Long Beach, UC Davis and CSUN, the three teams Santa Barbara has beaten during the team’s current win streak.</p>\n<p>Just a little over a week ago, UCSB was in a very different place. The Gauchos were coming off of a 3-1 thrashing at the hands of Cal Poly for their fourth loss in a row, and were staring up at the majority of the Big West.</p>\n<p>That feels so long ago now.</p>\n<p>“We’re just continuing to improve,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said after the match against CSUN. “We’re getting better, and we also got a couple players back that were out, so we had to deal with a lot of adversity.”</p>\n<p>In what should be a surprise to no one who has paid attention to the Gauchos this year, outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins was UCSB’s premier attacker in both of the weekend’s matches. The redshirt sophomore had 27 kills against Long Beach State and another 20 against CSUN, both team-highs.</p>\n<p>“(Lindsey) has been spectacular all week,” Lantagne Welch said. “We ask her to do a lot, and she really gave us a lot. She’s getting better at seeing the block and making really good choices, and it’s fun to see that evolve.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s stellar weekend went deeper than just Ruddins, however. Freshman Nicole Omwanghe put up a strong performance in both matches, in different aspects of the game. Omwanghe notched 11 kills, second-best on the team, against Long Beach and tied for first with seven total blocks against Northridge.</p>\n<p>Setter Annie Hasselmann was the other Gauchos with seven blocks on Saturday night, but her game was diverse as well. Hasselmann orchestrated the UCSB offense all match with 28 kills, one match after racking up a career-high 47 against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>As a whole, however, Welch wasn’t thrilled with her team’s passing even despite the successful results.</p>\n<p>“Our passing was not very good,” Lantagne Welch said. “I’m not (going to) sugarcoat it, we didn’t pass well but we actually passed better here than we did in (CSUN’s) gym because offensively we were able to sustain it.”</p>\n<p>Welch might not have liked how her charges passed, but it certainly didn’t seem to affect the Gauchos too negatively.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against Long Beach State was mostly a close battle throughout. UCSB battled back from an early deficit to take the first set, blew a small lead in the second set, and then led for the majority of both the third and fourth sets.</p>\n<p>The match against CSUN was a similar mix of drama and ease for the Gauchos, who won the first set with minimal worry. A victory in the second set, however, took an extended comeback from UCSB, who at one point trailed 17-9 and later 22-18.</p>\n<p>Welch’s worries about her team’s passing aside, the Gauchos looked like a team reborn over the weekend, something that they’ll look to continue into the future. UCSB is staring at a difficult slate of upcoming games, as they’ll take on Hawaii, then Cal Poly and finally UC Irvine in the next two weeks. Those three teams are the best of the Big West, and will serve as a major test of the Gauchos’ improvement.</p>\n<p>First up are the Rainbow Warriors, who will travel to Santa Barbara on October 28. The two teams will meet at Rob Gym at 5 p.m., due to the Halloween Delirium concert that night in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79239\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/revamped-gauchos-win-third-straight-to-end-the-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79239\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/revamped-gauchos-win-third-straight-to-end-the-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/revamped-gauchos-win-third-straight-to-end-the-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/revamped-gauchos-win-third-straight-to-end-the-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/revamped-gauchos-win-third-straight-to-end-the-weekend/","id":4958,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4957,4956,4955],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
