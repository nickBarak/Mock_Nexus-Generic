Businesses selling the stickers include Otaco, Hana Kitchen, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ, Hempwise and Sorriso Italiano.</p>\n<p>Hana Kitchen and Otaco owner Weston Suh said he started this project to help raise money for local charities such as Adopt-A-Block and I.V. Youth Project. The campaign is intended to give residents a way to both show their I.V. pride and support local businesses and charities at the same time, according to Suh.</p>\n<p>“I love Isla Vista … and the students here are really proud of living in I.V. and they know they have something special,” Suh said. “As great as it is, I know it can be so much more … Everything takes money.”</p>\n<p>Local charities often struggle to secure funding for their projects, which makes it very difficult to focus on achieving their goals, according to Suh.</p>\n<p>“I.V. is not really a city — one of the minuses is that funding is always an issue,” Suh said. “A lot of organizations have to spend so much time running around trying to get funding that they can’t focus on their projects … it’s kind of a catch-22.”</p>\n<p>Suh said he hopes the stickers will be just the first part of the campaign and plans to expand it if students respond positively.</p>\n<p>“Right now, we just have bumper stickers, but hopefully we can expand to bigger things and raise tens of thousands of dollars,” said Suh. “That’s really the goal … There’s a lot we can do.”</p>\n<p>According to Suh, Adopt-A-Block and I.V. Youth Project are the first charities that he hopes to work with, and more will follow as the program expands.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

will host the second annual Isla Vista Memorial Paddle Out on May 27 at 6 p.m. at the beach in front of the UCSB Lagoon and Manzanita Village to honor the lives lost on May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>Following the events of May 23 last year, approximately 3,000 students and I.V. community members attended Surf Team’s first annual paddle out. Students and I.V. community members on surfboards formed a circle about 50 yards offshore, while others remained on the beach. This year, UCSB Surf Team plans to host a similar ceremony, with nearly 3,000 identifying as attending on the event’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Event organizer and second-year communication major Stephanie Schechter said she expects 2,000–5,000 students to attend, with 1,000 paddling out to form the circle.</p>\n<p>“The reason we expect this turnout not only reflects on last year’s turnout, but also reflects on that this event is very positive,” Schechter said. “By having a really positive event, it might help people heal in a different way.”</p>\n<p>Paddle outs are a century-old Hawaiian tradition to honor the lives of those who have passed away, and they symbolize the belief that spirits continue to live in the ocean, according to Schechter.</p>\n<p>“In the modern sense, it’s kind of like closure,” Schechter said. “It’s sort of a way for the community to unite in remembrance for those who have passed — their spirits are moving on.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication and global studies double major Maggie Vlaco said she has attended many paddle outs, but the strength and unity of the participants in Surf Team’s paddle out in May 2014 was unique.</p>\n<p>“It was honestly one of the most incredible experiences I have been part of,” Vlaco said in an email. “There were so many different opinions and disagreements from people regarding the shootings and the events that happened, but the paddle out was something that we were all 100 percent unified and together on.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Alex Manrique said the event will be open to all community members, including those who prefer to remain on the beach.</p>\n<p>“I surf myself, but I get a really inclusive vibe from this event that’s open to anyone with or without a board,” Manrique said in an email. “I know Isla Vista isn’t this utopia it’s made out to be, but it definitely has its moments. This will definitely be one of those moments.”</p>\n<p>Manrique, a transfer student who did not attend UCSB last year, said the paddle out is a way to unite all attendees in remembrance and solidarity.</p>\n<p>“I’m participating in this paddle out to commemorate those that were lost to last year’s tragedy,” Manrique said in an email. “I feel that anyone who attends, whether they live here or not, is there for the same reason, and that’s to show solidarity.”</p>\n<p>Surf Team plans to provide lifeguards and safety personnel and asks attendees to bring boards, floats, kayaks and wetsuits to the paddle out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-27/surf-team-to-paddle-out/","id":4675,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[4674,4673,4672],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stakeholders Discuss Misconceptions, University Involvement","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/untitled-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista community members met in the I.V.

Clinic Building to discuss Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) during the weekly stakeholders’ meeting.</p>\n<p>Williams proposed AB 3 in December to establish a Community Services District (CSD) in I.V., which, if passed, would tax residents using a Utility Users Tax (UUT) and would garner funds to improve public services in I.V., such as parking and lighting. UCSB Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow presented an update on the university’s position regarding the inclusion of the university in the CSD as outlined in AB 3. Local business owner Jay Freeman gave an hour-and-a hal- presentation on pressing issues in I.V., past attempts to incorporate I.V. into Goleta and Goleta’s cityhood process.</p>\n<p>Freeman said stakeholders should consider going through the LAFCO process to assess whether or not I.V. could become a CSD.</p>\n<p>Thurlow said UCSB is not opposed to a CSD, but does not want the university to be included within I.V.’s boundaries because of the unknown precedent it may set for the UC system.</p>\n<p>“The University of California has communicated with Assemblymember Williams’ office that, at this point, the university should not be in,” Thurlow said. “This does not mean we are opposed to AB 3, this does not mean we are opposed to self-government or any other measures, but because of the nature of what AB 3 is … nobody knows the implications.”</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, I.V.’s problems such as parking and lighting will not be immediately solved by the establishment of a CSD, as some students may believe.</p>\n<p>“The issues here just kind of stay, and I think it’s something we don’t spend enough time talking about, which is kind of the difference in mindset between students,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said there have been previous efforts to divert I.V. celebrations, such as Halloween, into more structured events.</p>\n<p>“In 2003 we actually had Dia de Los Muertos celebrations on October 31,” Freeman said. “I think it’s interesting that we were already having events on Halloween.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said the current LAFCO board should not be judged based on decisions made by boards in previous years since its members change every year.</p>\n<p>“If you really think that LAFCO in 2001 was a horrible, horrible thing, they’ve replaced their staff, and now have internal staff they don’t contract out anymore,” Freeman said. “All of the commissioners except these two, one of whom is in the room [Craig Geiser] and has been very friendly to us.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Love held the I.V. Love and Remembrance Garden dedication ceremony for the six victims of the events of May 23 last year at a ceremony in the newly planted garden at People’s Park.</p>\n<p>UCSB administrators, students and Associated Students, county officials and representatives from participating organizations, such as Woodstock’s Pizza, Santa Barbara Forge + Iron and Seaborn Designs spoke at the event, officially opening the newly renovated park. The previous weekend, volunteers planted saplings and constructed a walking path through People’s Park around six benches with unique patterns representing the interests of each victim of the May 23 tragedy. Project I.V. Love founder and UCSB alumnus Jordan Killebrew, fourth-year art major Caila Baltas and fourth-year art major Jonathan Holcomb designed the benches and were present at the dedication.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said the garden is a “healing” place for the community to reflect on their memories of the victims.</p>\n<p>“This is a place where I think all of us can … sit here and connect with those precious lives, our friends, our fellow students who left us way too soon in their lives,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Killebrew said while the idea for the garden initially stemmed from his feelings of hopelessness following the tragedy, he appreciates the ability to honor the victims through the project.</p>\n<p>“It was way too close to home for me,” Killebrew said. “A year ago I would never have imagined this would happen and I’m just so happy that I have the opportunity to do something for the victims that we lost.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab instructor and spatial art professor Kim Yasuda said the circular design of the benches represents unity and “togetherness.”</p>\n<p>“The curves on the benches, if we were to put them in a circle, they form a perfect circle and the unity of those six students and imagining that for me is very, very comforting and very healing,” Yasuda said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Sam Spinner said he believes the memorial garden will have a lasting, positive impact on the community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great,” Spinner said. “I think we really needed something memorable for the next students to come here and realize how big of an impact this event made on us. It’s beautiful and all the benches are amazing.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year theater and film &amp; media studies double major Kirsten Nygaard said the garden is an important step towards the regrowth of I.V. after the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really wonderful that they were able to create something for the community to heal and to grow and to remember life and love,” Nygaard said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said I.V. is stronger and more united than she has ever seen it in her time as supervisor.</p>\n<p>“I am always proud to represent Isla Vista,” Farr said. “But in the seven years I have represented this community I have never been prouder of Isla Vista than I am at this moment.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/groups-dedicate-memorial-garden/","id":4677,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[4676,4675,4674],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
