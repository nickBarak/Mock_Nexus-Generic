Groups will compete for the funds, with the two best project proposals receiving $5,000 each.</p>\n<p>A.S. Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez, the architect behind the legislation, said the federal failure to invest in innovation initially inspired him to propose the fund.</p>\n<p>“NASA has no funding now. The United States is ranked 22nd in science and technology. That’s appalling,” Martinez said. “We can’t compete with countries on the rise like India and China when it comes to this kind of stuff.”</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, having student government support the sciences would help rekindle the innovative spirit of the United States.</p>\n<p>“$10,000 isn’t a lot, but it helps a bit,” Martinez said. “It helps contribute to people wanting to do something outside of the classroom and hopefully be like, ‘Maybe I can work on this for the federal government in the future.’”</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, president of UCSB’s Residence Halls Association, added that STARK allows A.S. to support and reach out to science and engineering students.</p>\n<p>“Students who work in the science-technology field on campus are really underserved by A.S.,” Abboud said. “A.S. does a lot to benefit certain groups, but one of the groups that A.S. hasn’t aided to — as much as other groups — is the science population.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the lack of dissent the bill faced from the Senate signified the widespread acknowledgement of its importance.</p>\n<p>“We don’t see a lot of engineers and we don’t see a lot of hard-science people in A.S.,” Martinez said. “A.S. has no form of grants that we give to projects. It’s time that we do that. It’s time that we reach out to those people who want to do hands-on projects … There was no opposition [from the Senate]; I think that shows that people understand the issues at hand.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau, who serves as an off-campus Senator for A.S. and officially proposed the bill to the Senate, pointed out the advantages that STARK could have for students attempting to pad their résumés.</p>\n<p>“I really think that this is a great direction that A.S. is going into, because … we’re also helping career paths,” Lau said. “Really when it comes down to it, your résumé is kind of everything.”</p>\n<p>Lau said she hopes to eventually expand the idea to other fields of study, making student government funds more accessible for academic pursuits.</p>\n<p>“It would really help to expand it to even writing groups — people who are English or art majors who want to publish art magazines and writing magazines,” Lau said. “It’s a great avenue to have money specifically for students to do things that will benefit their future.”</p>\n<p>However, Abboud said he feels that it is most important to address science-focused organizations, since these groups are most underrepresented in A.S.</p>\n<p>“We kind of already do fund different things … I don’t think that we should create another fund specifically for them,” Abboud said. “It’s better to have a specific one for science and technology, because they don’t feel right now that A.S. helps and caters to them … It’s good to put that institutional backing to the science groups.”</p>\n<p>Raul Martinez plans to contact every Office of Student Life organization that is science-related within the next week as the beginning steps of the $5,000 competition. The bill will go into effect next year.</p>\n<h6><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the February 6th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50149\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50149\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/","id":3109,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3108,3107,3106],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard","biography":"Not available","articles":[3010,3012,3020,3021,3027,3029,3038,3040,3043,3050,3058,3060,3061,3071,3072,3074,3076,3078,3079,3081,3085,3087,3089,3092,3098,3102,3104,3106,3107,3108,3109,3111,3112,3113,3115,3116,3117,6138],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"New Resignations Leave More Seats Empty in the A.S.

Additionally, Patel and Gallegos also attributed their respective resignations to an inabil- ity to balance senatorial duties with other responsi- bilities.</p>\n<p>In a debate about meeting length, Kennedy claimed lengthy meetings were an impor- tant factor in the overwhelming number of resignations.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already had one third of the Senate quit for this reason,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>Senator Ben Green, who does not plan to quit Senate, noted the weight of their responsibilities, taking the absence of Senate members at the meeting as a sign that the senators were being worked too hard.</p>\n<p>“I see a lot of empty seats and that’s indicative of the stress the Senate puts on us,” Green said.</p>\n<p>Segovia announced during that same meeting that she had met with A.S. mem- bers from other UC campuses and had been surprised to learn that none of them had dealt with resignations.</p>\n<p>While last week’s bill to cut off meet- ings at 9:45 p.m. did not pass, Senators did resolve to brainstorm ways to make meet- ings more efficient and thus less stressful. Nevertheless, the four resigned former- senators were not persuaded to remain.</p>\n<p>In light of last night’s resignations, Off- Campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson</p>\n<p>delivered an emotional address stating her personal frustration toward the situation.</p>\n<p>“This is killing me. This is ridiculous,” Christianson said. “I think everyone in this room can tell how much it’s affecting us.”</p>\n<p>Christianson continued to argue that meetings were in fact getting shorter as everyone had begun to become acclimated to their positions.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting better at it. Our 4:00 a.m. meetings were the first few meetings of the year,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>She then called for more honesty between senators and implored them to remember their duties to the student body.</p>\n<p>“More than anything, I want us all to be honest with each other. Please be hon- est with the Senate,” Christianson said. “Remember why you ran for this. Why are you here? It’s a big friggin’ deal … You have so much more power than people who want to make a difference … We have to be that outlet when people have grievances.”</p>\n<p>The new resignations leave several open seats in the Senate. If the people who received the second-highest number of votes in last spring’s elections do not choose to fill those spots, the Internal Vice President will be forced to begin a new application process.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 17th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/","id":3106,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3105,3104,3103],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Kaur earned the position by merit of her status as the next runner-up by number of votes in last spring’s A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>Several members of on-campus organiza- tions came to the public forum portion in sup- port of revisions to the A.S. constitution, which would include additional training requirements for senators in order to better prepare them for dealing with sexual harassment-related issues.</p>\n<p>Alex Moore, Co-Chair of Take Back the Night, offered his support for the new requirements. He argued that a trick- le-down education approach would greatly benefit the general student body by setting an example for other campus organizations.</p>\n<p>“It’s great to start a change in the culture from leader- ship down,” Moore said. “I highly encourage you to add the requirement.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair Danielle Bermudez echoed this sentiment, adding that an informed population of students would go a long way towards preventing sexual crimes.</p>\n<p>“Education — that’s the first step to ending sexual vio- lence,” Bermudez said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Sophia Armen addressed the Senate about a UC system-wide campus climate survey called “Answer the CALL,” which is designed to gauge various measures the campus atmosphere in order to bet- ter prevent discrimination and hate crimes. Armen said she would like to see a 40 percent response to the survey, which was distributed to every student through U-Mail, but so far, only about 10 percent of the student body has responded.</p>\n<p>Armen said she believes low participation results may be a result of the uncertainty surrounding survey’s purpose. “Part of the reason why there has been an initial student reluctance … is because of [students wondering,] ‘What are we going to do with the data?’” Armen said.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Armen stressed the importance of filling out the survey by the deadline of January 25th in order to add representative student input to potential university changes.</p>\n<p>“Whether or not you do take it, they are going to use the information,” she said. “If you don’t take it, it’s not going to represent you.</p>\n<p>Following Armen’s report, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Nadim Houssain spoke before the Senate about financial concerns for the University of California system and potential structural changes to the institution.</p>\n<p>Houssain said Proposition 30’s passage helped make Governor Brown’s recently proposed state budget a little more optimistic for the UC than it has been in years past.</p>\n<p>“Thanks to the passage of Prop 30, the government has followed up on its promise to contribute 250 million dollars to the UC system,” Houssain said.</p>\n<p>Houssain said he was unsure whether the allocation of a portion of that money towards online education is a worthy investment for the university.</p>\n<p>“What really concerns [me] is the complete online education,” Houssain said, contrasting “complete” online education with supplementary online materials to tradi- tional classes. “Not everyone has access to a computer or the internet … This shift would put grad students [who work as TAs] out of work … How do you enforce academic integrity [through online courses]?”</p>\n<p>Houssain also noted the possible negative effects that implementing online courses — which currently range in price from $1,400 to $2,400 — will have on lower-income students.</p>\n<p>“It may stratify students based on class,” Houssain said. “Those with more money will be able to afford in-class education while those in lower income brackets will opt for cheaper online classes, and I wouldn’t want to see that happen.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 24th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

In addition to other topics, student representatives debated the benefits and drawbacks of oil company divestments, while also measuring the fiscal downside to divesting from companies that emit fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Emily Williams, who acts as the statewide affairs coordinator for Environmental Affairs Board, requested the senate’s support in divesting from businesses with larger carbon footprints.</p>\n<p>Williams said the board is pursuing the support A.S. since they plan to take their proposal to the Board of Regents. She said it is necessary for the senate to set an example in such environmental efforts since UCSB holds such a strong reputation as a ‘green’ campus’.</p>\n<p>“It is almost hypocritical, in a way, for us to be invested in fossil fuels,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Raul Martinez, chair of Finance Board, questioned the fiscal impact of EAB’s proposal, saying it is inevitable the university turn to these companies.</p>\n<p>“Companies, firms, non-profits — they all have investments in portfolios and most of them have chairs in Exxon or Mobile. The reason is because it pays dividends,” Martinez said. “If you don’t have a company that pays that kind of dividend … that money needs to come from somewhere.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Martinez said such financial losses could translate into higher costs for students.</p>\n<p>“So either there are going to be cuts, or tuition is going to increase, or whatever they want to do,” Martinez said. “Universities need revenue now more than ever.”</p>\n<p>As the discussion wore on, off-campus senator Alex Choate asked how the senate could find the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p>“So I was wondering — is there another away that we can incorporate this, remaining socially responsible?” Choate said.</p>\n<p>In response, Martinez said senate members should take concerns for human rights into greater account than environmental concerns.</p>\n<p>“I’d rather be invested in companies that are in oil and energy, so long as they don’t violate human rights,” Martinez said. “This is going to sound really bad … but I’d rather be socially responsible to the students than to the environment.”</p>\n<p>However, Williams said ecological issues are equally important since they overlap with various other social issues.</p>\n<p>“By degrading the environment, it affects frontline communities,” Williams said. “People … whose water is polluted, who are experiencing more and more cases of asthma, of cancer — these are real things that are happening.”</p>\n<p>The plan would not be costly since the UC Regents would ensure transitional costs not reach the pockets of students, according to Williams.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson disagreed, saying past Regents decisions have not represented students.</p>\n<p>“I am going to have to disagree with you a little bit when you say that the regents prioritize the students first,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Without reaching any conclusion regarding the divestments, senators shifted their focus toward A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>Senators Tuquan Harrison and Hayley Gilbert proposed a plan to restrict the elections recruitment period to two weeks to allow for more “transparency.”</p>\n<p>However, some senators said restricting recruitment time would make it more difficult for party members to find the most qualified students, amongst other concerns.</p>\n<p>The senate agreed to table the bill for one week so they could eventually reach a more informed decision.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of January 31st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
