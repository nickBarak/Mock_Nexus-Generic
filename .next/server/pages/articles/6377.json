As Valentine’s Day is approaching, and is thus undoubtedly on the minds of most women out there, I feel a slight mix-up in the itinerary of intimacy that is called for. That’s right, gentlemen, I am publicly reminding all of you that the 14th is almost here. Panic accordingly.</p>\n<p>Today I’ll be ranting at you about dates. Knowledge of how to be successful on dates is of paramount importance! Without it, your future Valentine’s Days will be characterized by watching “Sleepless in Seattle,” surrounded by your 14 cats, each named after a squandered romantic pursuit, regardless of your gender — because everyone loves Meg Ryan.</p>\n<p>I love dates. I am a dater. Many girls I know bemoan their lack of dates. They grieve, “Why don’t guys ask me on dates?” Half of the dates I go on, however, I initiate. If I’m interested in someone, then why not? It’s very easy. All you do is go “Hey, we should get lunch sometime,” or “Hey, I’ve been contemplating tearing your clothes off with my teeth, perhaps we should indulge in the preliminary niceties.” Voila! If they say no, it’s no big deal. If you’re worried you’ll ruin a potential friendship or they may not be into you, don’t sweat it. It’s just lunch.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I will be covering three types of dates in this article: 1) my formula for a casual first date</p>\n<p>2) dates with people you’ve been seeing a little while and 3) dates for people you’re emotionally invested in.</p>\n<p>As far as casual lunch dates go, I have settled upon a simple formula. The rules are as follows:</p>\n<p>I get nervous before these dates. If I really don’t know the person that well and am unsure if I will have much to say, I’ll take a shot. A little liquid courage. Now, obviously, don’t get hammered before your date. Slurring at noon is generally frowned upon by the populace (even in I.V.).</p>\n<p>Have pocket questions. Nothing is worse than having an awkward lull so I come to a date with about four questions I can pull out if things get suddenly quiet. I try to make my four questions something that will give me a little insight to who they might be. For example, “What did you do this summer?” or “Why did you pick your major?” or “So tell me about the past three girls you’ve seen who’ve all gone mysteriously missing.” These will lead to them talking about their friends, hobbies or dreams. Bam. If it’s flowing well, you won’t have to pull out any more of your questions.</p>\n<p>I always plan to have my dates an hour before a commitment, like a class. This way, if it is a bad date or not too interesting, I have something I can leave for. There’s a definitive time limit. If it’s an awesome date, I’ll show my hesitation to leave, or simply blow off class. If it’s super bad, I can leave even earlier to “grab my school supplies.”</p>\n<p>Finally, the best way to make a lunch date just a little better is to take it to the beach. No one ever goes to the beach as much as they’d like to and it puts a little less pressure on conversation.</p>\n<p>Now, outside of the typical lunch date, there are some other options you can visit. Make her food. This is the best, most simple date to do … even if you suck at cooking. This really sweet delivery boy from work offered to make me dinner and after he said it, he immediately panicked. He had no idea how to cook. He had bought a bottle of wine and informed me that we were going to have pasta alfredo. Leaving the room, I returned to see him dumping clumps of frozen pasta alfredo from Trader Joe’s into a skillet. I didn’t even know it came like that. He promptly blushed, saying, “You weren’t supposed to see this part … I was going to throw the bags away.” I had a ton of fun, because a) he wanted to do something sweet for me, even if he lacked the skill and b) I couldn’t stop giggling the entire time. It came out gray, but I ate it anyway, especially after drinking the wine.</p>\n<p>Guys, if you can cook, that’s a major selling point. Invite her over, involve her in the process and you will both enjoy the end product. Girls, as I said, if you’re asking them out, this is a totally viable option for you, too. Sure you may have to suffer through some, “woman, make me a sammech” jokes, but a quick kick to the shin should quiet them.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been dating someone with some regularity, Valentine’s Day is a good opportunity to raise the bar. Being the hopeless romantics we are, I suppose we want you to take advantage of the one day of the year dedicated to romance and woo us. Woo the shit out of us. Last year, I had an awesome Valentine’s Day date, because my date built the event around what he knew about me. Knowing I had an unhealthy obsession with scary movies, he decided to appeal to that part of me. After dinner, he presented me with the agenda: We were going to drive to the top of a mountain to explore the ruins of Hearst Castle with flashlights and a baseball bat (safety first). Up the windy roads we drove, until civilization was but small dots in the valley. I briefly considered if he was going to murder me, but allowed the procession to venture forth. Sure, we had to look out for mountain lions and terrifying homeless men who were lurking around in the dark, but I loved it.</p>\n<p>If she likes hiking, go on a hike together with a picnic. If she likes art, pick up stuff to craft and watch a movie with some takeout or go to an art show. She likes making sculptures of her lover’s head out of gum and erecting shrines in her closet: run.</p>\n<p>Also, if you’re not terribly creative, you can always do something simple: Tell her you like her. I know a few girls who are sulking about because the guy they’ve been seeing hasn’t just said it. Sure it’s understood, but people still need to hear it. It’s something small, but it’s the best gift.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is the date for the people you are really invested in, maybe someone you love. I was talking to a good friend of mine who’s been with a girl for ages now, and he told me about their first date. This is the coup de grâce of dates. He picks up his lady love, looking sharp and smelling nice. Compliments should be the first thing out of your mouth, especially when they’re honest. If you’re thinking it, say it; it can only make her feel good. He made a reservation at a nice Japanese restaurant, got her whatever she wanted and filled the night with good conversation. After, they scoped out dessert, holding hands. Then, they went to go see “Whose Line is it Anyway?” at the Granada. Once home, he walked her to the door and they shared a short but sweet kiss before he went on his way. He wanted her to know that spending the whole night with her for one 10-second kiss was worth it all.</p>\n<p>That, ladies and gentlemen, is a date. I probably would have mauled my partner at the end like a rabid badger, but chastity does convey a message.</p>\n<p>All in all, sex is fun, but don’t pass up your chance for something better when it comes along. So go, my darlings, channel your inner Don Juan DeMarco and woo the pants off of your emotional targets. Be cheesy, be corny, be sappy. Happy Humping!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. would like to remind those without dates that there’s always vodka and Ben n’ Jerry’s Half Baked.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50054\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/what-happens-before-sex-and-no-this-time-were-not-talking-foreplay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50054\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/what-happens-before-sex-and-no-this-time-were-not-talking-foreplay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/what-happens-before-sex-and-no-this-time-were-not-talking-foreplay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/what-happens-before-sex-and-no-this-time-were-not-talking-foreplay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/what-happens-before-sex-and-no-this-time-were-not-talking-foreplay/","id":6377,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6376,6375,6374],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E.","biography":"Not available","articles":[6320,6325,6328,6347,6349,6351,6353,6356,6359,6361,6363,6368,6371,6372,6374,6376,6377,6381,6408],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Queen of the Hill: Tingling Tales of  Girl-On-Top","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Good day, my raunchy readers!

Today we will be pondering the complexities of girl-on-top. This entails subtopics such as where a male’s hands should be, the paramount importance of hip-guiding and the foolish insecurities of women. Let’s ride this topic out.</p>\n<p>Gentlemen, when it comes to girl-on-top, hand placement is a major factor in how well you will be graded. Your options are as follows: breasts, clit, hands or hips. Due to your prime real estate, you must take advantage of your free hands. Not using your hands is the equivalent of the “dead fish” female partner. Further elaborating upon the point of hips, hip-guiding falls into the realm of communication, and that’s important.</p>\n<p>When guiding the hips of a madam, you can control the speed, tempo and depth. Oftentimes girls assume that faster is better, but guys like going slow, too, so that they can better focus on the sensations building up. By guiding her, you can help her figure out just what you want. Many times girls might feel awkward because them controlling the motions are atypical, so more feedback makes them more comfortable with exploring this elevate realm. Plus, it’s freakin’ sexy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Hombres, if there is anything you take from this article, let it be this: never, ever, ever put your hands behind your head. I’ve stopped and traded in my friction for some slanderous diction. Others will abandon your love boat completely, preferring the treacherous seas of abstinence. It may be comfortable, but it makes you look like a D-bag.</p>\n<p>Another much appreciated effort: when you grab a girl’s wrists in both hands and put them over your head. G’damn. And ladies, feel free to pin him as well when on top. Everyone loves a little power struggle. Your dominion over his titillating territory/provocative province (oh, how I love alliteration) can be emphasized by eye contact. Eye contact is particularly sexy when you initiate it atop your fleshy throne. Just as chimpanzees will challenge one another via the medium of a sullen stare, you too assert your sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Personally, I feel like eye contact is a good move in sexual relations. It always surprises me when people say that they dislike eye contact due to the intensity of the intimacy it generates. Allow me to remind you that sex is an intimate act and despite however emotionally casual your relationship with a partner may be, you shouldn’t shy away from the increased sexual tension. Eye contact is a universal acknowledgement of the other person’s existence. So acknowledge the eff out of their sexual existence. Ladies, when in reverse cowgirl, toss him a smokey gaze over your shoulder all sexy-like. Maybe gape like a fish, I think guys are actually into that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>Speaking of reverse cowgirl, let’s talk about the scenic views of your grassy pastures. When in reverse, lean further towards his feet. It provides a deliciously vulgar view of him entering you that he will pause to appreciate. This is the best time to go nice and slow. If you lean even farther forward, he can sit up while propped against something. This variation provides good leverage, a delicious angle of your badonk sitting pretty on his lap.</p>\n<p>An additional variation that I’m very excited about (and you should all do this like it’s homework) is as follows: in reverse cowgirl, pull up one of his knees. Put your knees on either side and hold onto his knee to maneuver yourself up and down better. It’s especially yummy because you have friction on your privies from his thigh.</p>\n<p>Speaking of thighs, a problem a lot of women have is being insecure on top for superficial reasons, like the dimples on your thighs. Playa’ please, he’s not looking at the dimples. He’s focusing on your pretty face and ogling your bouncing bazoongas.

From fetishism to transgender attraction to polyamorous behavior to non-heterosexuality, non-normative sexual behavior reflects perhaps most directly the twisting and fluid nature of the human subconscious —it is intertwined with our animal past, complicated by our cerebral evolution, and manifested in our daily lives. With this article I intend to analyze the spectrums by which these non-normal sexual behaviors are defined and draw a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, our society seems to have created several spectrums with which to quantify sexual preference. There is a spectrum along the sex line — whether one prefers a penis or vagina. Another spectrum exists along the gender line — this is harder to define, but slides from typically masculine behavioral traits to typically feminine behavioral traits. A third spectrum spans between what is considered “vanilla sex” and “kinky sex” — this covers a vast variety of possible “kinks,” but fundamentally hinges on the sex act itself. A fourth spectrum captures the idea of monoamory (literally ‘one love’) versus polyamory (literally ‘many loves’) — though this spectrum, perhaps, can be represented as a simple binary preference.</p>\n<p>So let us start by looking at the first spectrum, as it decides whether someone is gay or straight. The psychology behind this spectrum is incredibly convoluted by our society. It is entirely preferable to be heterosexual in this culture, but the fact homosexuals exist suggests that there is a large genetic component. But we define sexuality as a spectrum for a reason — many people hover in the middle of pure straight and pure gay, developing a preference over time and through experimentation. But in the end there is a distinct lack of control involved with where you end up. Some people are compelled to only find penises attractive, some people vaginas. And, of course, some are lucky enough to be able to fluidly shift between the two.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But if the sex preference is determined by factors beyond society’s means to control, the gender preference is almost a complete societal construction. By creating distinct images of what a man should be and what a woman should be, society can compel its population to find certain things attractive or unattractive. The root of the preference, however, is simple. One finds certain personality traits attractive, and based on how many of those traits are masculine or feminine, finds a place on this scale.</p>\n<p>The kink scale arises from a person’s preferences surrounding the sex act itself. Some people enjoy dominating others, while some enjoy being dominated. Others might find feet irresistible, or latex or furry animal costumes. Kink comes out of the deep places of the subconscious, and the number of fetishes are so diverse they escape analysis by simple means. And so to define where one lays on this spectrum, one must turn to the definition of normal. Again, what is “normal” sex and what is “kinky” sex is here defined by society. Thus, kink is a measure of how normative one’s preference in sexual activity is.</p>\n<p>And, finally, we have the binary of one single love versus many loves. This might arise from two places — the first is a throwback to patriarchal systems. This system can be observed in archaic Mormonism, where men were polygamists while women were monogamous (polygyny, in other words). The more contemporary version of polyamory seems to derive itself from the concepts of free love and, more generally, communalism. Men and women can possess multiple partners and all of it seems to be in the spirit of the freedom to love as many as one wants. Monoamory, on the other hand, promotes the idea of giving one’s all to a single, special person. It is individualistic and romantic and is the normalized model in our culture.</p>\n<p>Now, each of these scales possesses a societal majority side (heterosexual, cis-gender, vanilla sex, and monoamory) and each possesses a minority side. Interestingly, however, where one exists on each spectrum is not coupled to where one exists on the others. A heterosexual man could be kinky with his one very special butch female. A bisexual could have vanilla sex with her somewhat feminine male partner on Tuesdays and her caring female partner of Thursdays. Gays can settle down with one person or many. And the reason for this decoupling is the fundamental deterministic psychology behind each preference.</p>\n<p>The sex preference is a biological and social imperative about what a person has sex with.</p>\n<p>The gender spectrum is a personality-based preference about with whom a person has sex.</p>\n<p>The kink preference is about how a person has sex.</p>\n<p>The poly/monoamory is about how many people the person allocates emotion to.</p>\n<p>The behaviors do not arise from the same roots – they are independent preferences and come with independent desires. Interestingly, however, the sexual minorities from each group are often linked together in the social conscious and treated as a single, bulk community.</p>\n<p>Thus we reach the point I wanted to draw. It is dangerous to set equal these minorities in the social psychology, as they represent very different interests and very different goals. Each minority group deserves equality, but to treat a gay person as identical to a polyamorist or a fetishist as someone who is gender queer is an offensive simplification of sexual identity and sexual preference. Some gays want nothing more than to settle down with one true love, while others push for their polyamory to be accepted. Some fetishists enjoy the company of the same sex and others of the opposite.</p>\n<p>And so, it is my hope that our society might start to see the sexual minorities as individual communities, allied in their struggle for acceptance but not identical in their desires or differences. Each represents a different aspect of society’s relationship with sex, and each should be examined as its own unique identity.</p>\n<p><em>Anonymous tops his scoop of vanilla with a dopple of kink-sauce.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49043\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49043\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-21/gay-straightvanilla-kinky-polyamory-femme-butch-palette-sexual-tastes-minorities/","id":6375,"author":{"id":450,"name":"Anonymous"},"related":[6374,6373,6372],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bite Me: Sink Your Teeth into the Wonders of Kink","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gather round, gather round, one and all.

Today our topic is one of much excitement: kinky sex. But before we get there we must take a peek into my past, so you can understand how I have suffered for this cause. Now, please understand when going into this story that the spirit of it all was admirable. The carrying out was less so. This article will offer suggestions that, had my partner been aware of such things, may have lessened my plight. That’s right; it’s time for another awkward sexual anecdote.</p>\n<p>It was summer 2012. My small tank of a friend had persuaded me to drink copious amounts of alcohol before taking me to a frat party. Shortly after arriving, I found a companion for the evening and we made it over to his place. Both fairly tipsy, he was a tad rough, not in the delightful way I will be encouraging, but in the, “Ow, ow, softer dumbass,” way. This is where things went terribly wrong. Like a good partner, he was terribly eager to go south, and that’s when I opened my big dumb mouth. “Bite my thigh,” I foolishly uttered. Grinning saucily up at me, he did as he was told. However, when I said bite, I meant really more of a nip, something soft and inspiring. What I got was a bruise that lasted three weeks. It looked like someone had shot a baseball at my thigh at a whopping 60 mph. For days I could not fathom how it got there, I was too consumed with agitation at the eight hickies he had dispatched across my neck. The moment of realization was characterized by sheer horror: Yes, those were teeth indents. The moral of this story is thus: A) a number of my sexual situations are uncomfortable and weird and B) bite others as you would like to be bitten. Now, to be sure, I am happy he bit me. I wish he hadn’t bit me like he was making an appearance in Shark Week, but I appreciate his willingness to adventure. And that is what characterizes much of the kink.</p>\n<p>As unabashed as I am in ranting about my junk and sexual prowess to you nice people, I too occasionally remain mum on my desire for hair pulling, ass smacking and mouth covering. When I was hooking up with a BDSM dom (bondage, dominance, sadism, masochism) back in fall quarter, I felt I was finally getting an outlet for all the wild things I really wanted to do. It was the most fun I’ve ever had in bed, hands down, because it was so fresh and bad and shameful that it made sex new and shiny all over again. When did sex become so routine? Shouldn’t you blush just a tad when you think of the things you did? At this point it’s become, “Oh yeah, we hooked up, had sex, whatevs.” For shame! I want to see girls whispering behind their hands into their friends’ ears about the wild and crazy things they’ve done in the dark.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Now, a lot of people are freaked out by the idea of kinky sex. You can imagine why. Their mind goes to the freaky German dungeon porn they came across when they clicked the wrong pop-up on the internet. But rest assured, there are ways to be kinky in your interactions without freaky torture machines.</p>\n<p>For those uncomfortable with kinky sex, that is just fine. This article may not apply to you. However, there is the chance that you might be with someone who digs some kink one night and you should have some awareness as to handle the situation. A big disappointment occurs when an individual actually asks to get kinkier, after summoning the courage, but their partner, unsure, half asses it. Fake it, guys, fake it. If your partner senses your inhibition or your lack of commitment, they become disappointed and may be discouraged to ask in the future. Additionally, don’t make them ask more than once. If they ask at all and you’re down at all, expect to include it in your sexual routine.</p>\n<p>Another important note for the unsure is this: Try everything once. If you don’t like it, you don’t like it. Now you know. As a rule, try to keep open minded about everything until you can say for yourself that it does not appeal to you. Now that we have these things in mind, we can move on.</p>\n<p>First, let us visit the very important distinction of biting verses nipping. Nipping is applied to sensitive areas like nipples, earlobes, THIGHS. Biting is sometimes for necks, shoulders and less sensitive areas. Be aware of sensitivity prior your chomp fest. Perhaps the most important thing you can take away from my advice on bighting is to do unto others as you would have them do for you. Bite experimentally; start off light always. If they want it harder, they’ll ask and you can build up. Or if they are fairly quiet, maybe your partner is a bit less sensitive and you can take that as a cue.</p>\n<p>Aside from biting, there is the classic ass smack. Now, if you’re really going to smack someone’s ass, it is important to rub it out afterwards. You smack, and then rub your palm in circles in the afflicted area. This significantly lessens the pain and gives it more of a pleasurable edge. Plus, you get a good grope in.</p>\n<p>Scratching is also wonderful. My last partner looks like he was mauled by a pack of disgruntled cats. It’s the same with biting, start a little lightly to see if they like it. If they like the biting, you can be sure they like the scratching. Try not to rip off a layer of skin, if you can help it.</p>\n<p>Hair pulling should be done as close to the roots as possible, with a handful of hair, not a small section. This reduces the pain and instead causes a refreshing sensation. I have had my hair pulled improperly. Imagine if you will, yours truly seated upon a frat kitchen counter, with my head basically touching my back. Humans are not supposed to bend that way, or they would have named us Gumbies. The arc is nice, but please, do not break your partner’s neck.</p>\n<p>When it comes to choking, I, personally, am not a fan. I was making out with this guy and he started doing it and I stopped him. Confused, his response was thus, “Did you have an abusive boyfriend?” …to which I replied, “No, I just like breathing.” Simple as that. However, some girls are super hot for this. After discussing it with my associates, the key is not to suffocate her (dur), but instead to apply light pressure. Place your hand on her neck, and press slightly with the flat of your palm. Then minimally increase the pressure, if encouraged by your bedmate.</p>\n<p>Now, while I may personally dislike choking, mouth covering is another thing altogether. Some of us are louder than others. Roommates are often less than thrilled with our sexual presence. My favorite remedy to this conflict of interest is for a guy to muffle my cries with his palm. Gents, do this while whispering quietly in her ear, “shhh.” Continuing this tangent of covering, a good friend of mine goes crazy when you cover her eyes. It’s a simpler form of blindfolding and it really just gives that feeling of susceptibility.</p>\n<p>In terms of being tied up, oh yum. Now, it probably isn’t a good first hook up move to break out the silken ties or handcuffs. But, you can absolutely pin them down. This is unbelievably hot. Do that. It’s fun to squirm in your hold and it establishes your dominance which is something a lot of people fail to do. Sex is best in my opinion with a bit of a power struggle.</p>\n<p>Finally, and most kinkily, in my humble opinion is getting in your partner’s head. Saying things. Having them say things. Commanding them to do things. For those of you who have deigned to read my vibrator article, you may remember the anecdote of my partner informing me that I must petition him on whether or not I could come. This is a prime example. The best way to get someone in a submissive head state, I’ve come to believe, is to have them repeat a phrase over and over. Approximately three to five times. If done properly, it puts you in a trance like state. I shit you not. For instance, “What am I doing to you?” Fill in the blank, “What can I do to you?” To which you say breathily, “Whatever you want.” Repeat this sequence three or so times, preferably while pleasuring them so they are foggy headed and unquestioning of your bizarre inclination to repeat yourself.</p>\n<p>I will leave out other things for fear that they cannot be published. All in all, it is important to push your boundaries and try new things. You’ll never know unless you try. Undoubtedly, a lack of kink is the most lamented aspect of many individuals’ sex lives. That and an inkling as to where the clitoris is. So my darlings, break the bondage of standard sex and get a little spicy! Adios muchachos; hump most happily!</p>\n<p><em>Hayley E. knows how to keep a hose flowing, even when it’s kinked.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49570\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49570\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/bite-me-sink-your-teeth-into-the-wonders-of-kink/","id":6376,"author":{"id":442,"name":"Hayley E."},"related":[6375,6374,6373],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
