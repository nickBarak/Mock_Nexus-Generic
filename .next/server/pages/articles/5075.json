Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The historical background of the Blue-Green rivalry between UCSB and Cal Poly requires no explanation when analyzing the intense competition both of these teams present when facing each other. Thursday’s matchup will be the second meeting between the UCSB women’s volleyball team and the Mustangs this season. Cal Poly’s 3-1 victory over the Gauchos on Oct. 10 was its first win over UCSB in four years. Santa Barbara attempts to even the season series up, hosting the Mustangs in the Thunderdome. Cal Poly has not won a match in the Thunderdome since Nov. 6, 2010.</p>\n<p>Owning a 6-14 overall and 2-7 conference record, UCSB looks to upset a Cal Poly team that has won seven of its past eight matches. Prior to its five-set loss to Long Beach State this past Saturday, the Mustangs had won seven straight. They currently hold a 15-5, 7-2 Big West record and are tied with LBSU for second place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>Currently on a two-match losing streak after wins the week before, it seems like a possible change in the Gauchos’ starting lineup or rotation would be a possible solution to their setback. However, with just four seniors and a variety of players that have seen little to no time, the Gauchos do not have many alternatives to put on the court.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We don’t have a lot of options because we don’t have a lot of available people,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “We have to get better at what we’re doing and we have to learn how to finish games and finish teams off.”</p>\n<p>Thursday being UCSB’s only match of the week, the Gauchos should be properly prepared for the Mustangs. They must find a way to prevent Cal Poly’s dominant duo of freshman Adlee Van Winden and Raeann Greisen. The two outside hitters have nicely complimented each other this season and are the team’s top two leaders in kills and kills per set average, owning a combined total of 249 kills and an 8.04 average. They shined in Cal Poly’s bout against UCSB earlier this year as Van Winden recorded 20 kills and Greisen added 17. Coming off her sixth Big West Freshman of the Week award after a weekend in which she recorded 38 kills and 21 digs, containing Van Winden along with Greisen will be a strenuous task.</p>\n<p>“They [Cal Poly] are going to set their outsides a bunch of times, they’re very good attackers from the pen,” Lantagne Welch said. “We actually did a pretty good job on Van Winden, even though she had a lot of kills. We feel like we didn’t give her a lot of ‘freebies,’ she had to really work for them. We have to be able to contain and score on our end.”</p>\n<p>UCSB managed to contain the Mustangs in their first bout. Santa Barbara outhit and outblocked Cal Poly, averaging a hitting clip of .239 and 18 blocks to the Mustangs’ .231 attacking average and 12 blocks.</p>\n<p>Still, the Gauchos’ inconsistencies to finish when playing in narrow sets has pestered the team for the majority of the season and was the deciding factor in Cal Poly winning the final two sets in their win over UCSB earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara played from behind in that matchup, causing a 1-1 tie in the second set of that match. But UCSB knows it must find a way to finish in hopes of avoiding another late-game letdown.</p>\n<p>“For us, it’s playing really good in the critical points,” Lantagne Welch said. “That was a determining factor in our match at Cal Poly and also affected us this past weekend. We need to get over that hump and have people that really want to be in a pressure moment come forward and play their best. We need more people to rise to that challenge and are excited about that challenge.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s match between UCSB and Cal Poly will begin at 7:00 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65871\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65871\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/wvb/","id":5075,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5074,5073,5072],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos’ Pair of Rematches a Chance at Redemption","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CamerynBrock_WVolleyball-16-of-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CamerynBrock_WVolleyball-16-of-20-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Coming off its first conference victory of the season, the UCSB women's volleyball team gears up for road matches against Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge.

UCSB looks to improve its 6-12 overall, 2-5 conference record against a recuperating 49er team and the declining Matadors.<br>\nLong Beach State is in search of regaining its dominance of the Big West as the 49ers now have two conference losses after a 2-3 loss to No. 8 Hawaii last Sunday. Still, they possess a notable record at 15-5 overall, 5-2 in Big West play. After a blazing 3-0 start to open its conference schedule, Cal State Northridge has been swept in its last three consecutive games. The Matadors’ latest slump leaves them with a 4-14 overall record, 3-3 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A pivotal asset to the Gauchos’ success in the past weekend, freshman setter Emilia Petrachi looks to capitalize on her tremendous play. Petrachi received Big West Freshman and Defensive Player of the Week awards for her remarkable performance in UCSB’s two victories. She finished the weekend with a total of 43 digs and an incredible average of 5.38 digs per set. Notably, since the start of conference play, Petrachi leads the Big West with an average of 4.92 digs per set. Her productivity will be vital to the Gauchos defending against Long Beach State’s offense, who ranks third in kills per set in the conference with a 13.33 average.</p>\n<p>Despite having its 23-conference-match winning streak snapped earlier this season, Long Beach State remains as one of the Big West’s most prominent teams when playing on home court. The 49ers have an active streakof 14 straight conference wins when playing in Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p>Guiding LBSU’s resilient home stand is the play of junior outside hitter Nele Barber. The Marquette University transfer has tallied double digit kills in all of the 49ers’ matches and owns a team-high of 297 kills, ranking second in the Big West. Barber has recorded a double-double and led Long Beach State in kills in 16 of 20 matches so far this season. Furthermore, she has led Long Beach State in kills for its last eight matches.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ last pit stop in their road trip through southern California is at Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s three-match losing streak comes as a result of playing the Big West’s top three teams in Cal Poly, Hawaii and Long Beach State. In two of the team’s three losses, the Matadors did not have one player in double digit kills. However, in its most recent loss to LBSU, senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson erupted for a tied match-high of 18 kills. Her average of 4.55 kills per set and 91 kills since the start of Big West play rank in the conference’s top five, respectively. The Matadors certainly are a better team after a grueling trio of matches and should not be overlooked heading into Saturday’s contest.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s inability to close out sets in its initial meetings versus LBSU and CSUN primarily led to the Gauchos’ 3-1 defeats to both teams. However, Santa Barbara showed some improvements by holding UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton to hitting averages below .200.</p>\n<p>“That’s something that we did well this weekend, playing well in the tight sets and finishing at the end,” Lantagne Welch explained. “If you’re keeping a team from hitting a good clip, they’re going to get frustrated and make more errors. At the same point, if you can attack well and get enough kills from enough spots you’re going to score points. Those are two critical things, that we’re sharp on both sides of the ball.”</p>\n<p>The start time of UCSB at Long Beach State is set for Friday, Oct. 23rd at 7:00 p.m. at Walter Pyramid. The following day’s match at Cal State Northridge on Saturday, Oct. 24th will take place at 7:00 p.m. in the Matadome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/gauchos-pair-of-rematches-a-chance-at-redemption/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/gauchos-pair-of-rematches-a-chance-at-redemption/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/gauchos-pair-of-rematches-a-chance-at-redemption/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/gauchos-pair-of-rematches-a-chance-at-redemption/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/gauchos-pair-of-rematches-a-chance-at-redemption/","id":5072,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5071,5070,5069],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Volleyball Suffers Third Straight Conference Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A 3-1 loss to CSUN puts the Gauchos in a difficult position through three games in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65009\" style=\"width: 292px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GirlsVB_October-02-2015_BRANDT-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1703263172\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65022\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65009\" data-attachment-id=\"65009\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/alexis-rottman-tips-the-ball-over-the-net-spencer-brandtdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GirlsVB_October-02-2015_BRANDT-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Spencer Brandt\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Alexis Rottman tips the ball over the net.

Spencer Brandt/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>While losing isn’t an embracing result, a team’s attitude after its loss definitely influences its performance on the court. Despite falling to 4-10 and 0-3 in conference, the demeanor of the UCSB women’s volleyball team remains resolute as it continues to search for its first win in nine games.</p>\n<p>Through just three games, Santa Barbara has now faced the top three programs in the Big West. It managed to win the opening sets in both of its matches, but became prone to allowing various scoring stretches, which led to UCSB losing three consecutive final sets to end the game in its two home conference openers. Missing from UCSB’s starting lineup this weekend were two of its most prominent players in redshirt senior Hanna Nielson and sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman.</p>\n<p>Prior to the beginning of Big West play, Cal State Northridge was once in the same losing quandary as the Gauchos. The Matadors entered conference play with an eight-game losing streak but have recently been the most astounding team, winning its first two conference matchups. CSUN overcame its early set loss and improved to an undefeated three wins in conference, beating UCSB 3-1 in set scores of 25-27, 25-14, 25-20 and 25-20. The Matadors are now 4-12 overall with a 3-1 Big West record after losing to Cal Poly yesterday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Matadors seemed destined to win the initial set, facing set-point with a 24-21 lead that led to a UCSB timeout. Yet, the quick break benefited UCSB as it made a substitution that put senior opposite Britton Taylor in the game. The change in rotation was the starting point in the Gauchos’ comeback as Taylor thumped the ball for a kill, trimming the deficit to two at 22-24. Back-to-back kills by freshman Annie Hasselmann and junior Elizabeth Sheffield put the finishing touches on Santa Barbara’s 6-1 run, securing the set victory 27-25.</p>\n<p>After achieving a .381 hitting clip in the first set, UCSB’s offense continued to prosper as it opened the second set with a 4-0 run. But Northridge responded with a 6-0 rally of its own to take a 6-4 lead and force a Santa Barbara timeout. The Matadors never lost the lead again and a 9-3 run locked a 25-14 second set win.</p>\n<p>During the second set and latter periods of the match, there was some displeasure expressed by UCSB Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch toward the officiating. Specifically, her complaints were directed toward the line judge for some calls that seemed to favor the Matadors as they went on to win sets three and four.</p>\n<p>When asked if the calls had an influence on the match’s result: “it had an influence on some of the frustrations, but we’ve got to clean up our side of the ball and that’s something uncontrollable that we can’t worry about,” she said. “We played great in set one, we hit over .300 which is excellent. We have to realize that teams are going to adjust and we have to be more adaptable. We have to be quicker to adjust and I think that was something that hurt us tonight.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended Friday’s match with a .164 hitting average while CSUN managed to hit a clip of .200 plus throughout the match’s entirety (.323 match average). Senior outside hitter Cieana Stinson led the Matadors’ assertive attack with a match-high 19 kills. Northridge’s best hitting performance appeared in the fourth set — it clinched victory with a dominant .448 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>A repeat of last season’s 16-0 conference record is now fictitious for No. 24 Long Beach State after being upset 3-1 by Cal Poly on Friday, snapping the 49ers’ 23-match Big West winning streak. However, LBSU accepted the loss and is back to its winning ways after its 3-1 victory over UCSB. Long Beach bounced back for the win in sets of 18-25, 25-19, 26-24 and 25-12.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65008\" style=\"width: 276px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"938735734\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65022\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65008\" data-attachment-id=\"65008\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/shauna-klein-receives-the-ball-from-her-opponent-steven-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.02-StephenManga-WVB-11-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Shauna Klein receives the ball from her opponent.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>UCSB managed to take advantage of the vulnerable 49ers in the first set of Saturday’s contest. A 9-4 run set the tone for its offense — three-straight service aces by Sheffield helped Santa Barbara finish the opening set with a .452 hitting clip. UCSB maintained its lead, but LBSU trimmed the deficit to four-points at 15-19, which led to a Santa Barbara timeout. It helped prevent a shift in momentum which led to the Gauchos’ protecting their lead and earning the 18-25 set victory.</p>\n<p>Hoping to avoid consecutive upset losses, Long Beach State answered back with a 25-19 win in the second set. Starting the third set with a 7-1 run, Santa Barbara inched closer to a 2-1 lead. But the 49ers’ 8-2 run notched the score at 9-9. A series of lead changes and ties would occur, when tied 24-24, kills by freshman outside hitter Megan Kruidhof and freshman libero Mykah Wilson snagged the 26-24 third set victory for Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>The results of the third set proved to be the deciding factor in yesterday’s match. “They started taking more chances with their serve and we couldn’t answer — we got stuck in a couple rotations,” Lantagne Welch said. “We need to be able to answer quicker because we were in control of that set.”</p>\n<p>In spite of double-digit kill performances by seniors Ali Barbeau and Taylor, as well as 39 assists by freshman setter Annie Hasselmann , the 49ers’ stunning .625 hitting percentage in the match’s final set stamped their victory. LBSU sits at 13-4, 3-1  in conference play.</p>\n<p>UCSB finds itself on the road for weekday and weekend matchups. The Gauchos will face UC Davis this Thursday, Oct. 8 at 7:00 p.m. at The Pavilion. On Saturday, Oct. 10, they will visit Cal Poly for a 7:00 p.m. match in Robert A. Mott Athletic Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65022\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65022\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/womens-volleyball-suffers-third-straight-conference-loss/","id":5073,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5072,5071,5070],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Inability to Close Leads to Disheartening Losses on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WVball_vsUCR-20151016-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"After triumphant wins last weekend, inconsistencies in securing victories continue to plague the UCSB women's volleyball team as it experienced losses to Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State.

CSUN’s 3-2 comeback victory over UCSB improves the Matadors’ record to 5-15, 4-4 in conference play and ending their four-match losing skid. Despite trailing by a deficit of two sets, Northridge managed to win in sets of 8-25, 19-25, 25-21, 25-23, and 15-10. Long Beach State added a couple wins to its record with its sweep of the Gauchos in scores of 26-24, 25-18, and 25-18 on Friday and its 3-2 win over Cal Poly on Saturday.

Despite being able to win the opening set in various matches this season, UCSB entered Saturday’s match 3-4 in games, in which it won the opening set — but never had the Gauchos lost with a lead of two sets.</p>\n<p>Arguably giving their best performance in a set this season, the Gauchos started with a 25-8 rout of the Matadors to open the match. CSUN absolutely had no match for the UCSB’s bruising offensive attack. Free of errors and a total of 10 kills, Santa Barbara had an astonishing .667 hitting clip. Continuing her phenomenal serving performance from the team’s previous contests, senior opposite Jaylen Villanueva notched four of her match-high six service aces in the first set, igniting UCSB’s season-high finish of 12 aces to help the Gauchos take a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s dominance continued in the second set as it followed its dynamic attacking clip with a .393 hitting percentage. Leading the Gauchos’ offensive charge was its barrage of hitters: Barbeau, senior opposite Britton Taylor, and junior middle blocker Phoebe Grunt.</p>\n<p>The trio combined for 33 of the team’s 51 kills; Barbeau finished with a match-high 14 kills. Taylor ended with nine kills and a .368 attack percentage while Grunt had 10 kills in addition to her .529 hitting clip. Tied 11-11, a kill by Villanueva handed Santa Barbara its first lead in the second set and sparked the Gauchos’ 6-2 run, forcing two CSUN timeouts. In spite of the Matadors attempt to recuperate, UCSB would go on to take the 25-19 win to increase its lead to 2-0.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s offense flourished, clocking a .488 hitting average in its two set victories, its defense prohibited the Matadors from gaining any offensive chemistry by holding CSUN to hitting clips of -.182 and .088. The Gauchos allowance of just eight points in the first set is the team’s lowest opponent point total of the season.</p>\n<p>Halting the Matadors’ attack attempts at the net were Taylor, Grunt, and junior middle blocker Elizabeth Sheffield.  They accounted for the team’s three solo blocks with one apiece and were responsible for 16 of UCSB’s 26 block assists.</p>\n<p>With Santa Barbara outhitting Cal State Northridge with a kill average of .254 to .164, the Matadors’ comeback seemed impossible as they were on the brink of being swept.</p>\n<p>Down 0-2, allowing an 8-1 UCSB run to open the third set, it was plausible that a repeat of the first set was destined to occur. However, trailing 4-10, the Matadors’ 7-0 scoring stretch allowed them to take an 11-10 lead. Despite one lead change in which the Gauchos led 14-13, Northridge eventually regained the lead and captured the 25-21 set victory to trim the Gauchos’ lead to 2-1.</p>\n<p>A late 7-2 rally in the closing of the fourth set helped CSUN edge UCSB for the 25-23 win and 2-2 tie. With the momentum on their side, runs of 9-2 to open the fifth set and 5-1 to conclude it earned the Matadors their 3-2 come-from-behind victory.</p>\n<p>Guiding CSUN in its three-straight unanswered set wins were outside hitters senior Cieana Stinson and junior Julie Haake, who each had 13 kills.</p>\n<p>Prior to Saturday’s duel, UCSB’s loss at Long Beach State simply came down to the seemingly unstoppable success of the 49ers’ offense. Long Beach overpowered UCSB with a .374 hitting clip, earning a .472 attack percentage in the match’s final set. A total of three 49ers hit over the .500 mark, one of them being freshman outside hitter Carly Beddingfield, who recorded a match-high 12 kills in support of Long Beach sweeping UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended the match with a sufficient .231 hitting clip but had no players with double digit kills. In spite of having substantial leads for the majority of the first and second sets, the Gauchos’ inability to maintain their leads aided the 49ers in their straight sets victory.</p>\n<p>“I think we played a good match. But there were times where we were up and we should have closed it out,” Barbeau explained. “That’s an issue that we face as a team. Long Beach is a good team, second in conference, and we put up a good fight against them.”</p>\n<p>For the second consecutive week, sophomore outside hitter Chanel Hoffman was inactive due to injury.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara gets its chance to host the classic Blue-Green rivalry this Thursday, Oct. 29, when the Cal Poly Mustangs visit for a 7 p.m. matchup in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65770\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/gauchos-inability-to-close-leads-to-disheartening-losses-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65770\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/gauchos-inability-to-close-leads-to-disheartening-losses-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/gauchos-inability-to-close-leads-to-disheartening-losses-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/gauchos-inability-to-close-leads-to-disheartening-losses-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-25/gauchos-inability-to-close-leads-to-disheartening-losses-on-the-road/","id":5074,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[5073,5072,5071],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
