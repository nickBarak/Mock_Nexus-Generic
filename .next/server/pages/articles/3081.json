These forms will then be sent to the Director of Accountability in the Office of the Internal Vice President.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Miya Sommers, who authored the bill, said the goal of the action is to implement a more efficient system for ensuring that senate members are performing their duties to the best of their abilities.</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja, a proxy for Off-Campus Senator Genesis Herrera, added that the bill will hopefully resolve what she perceives as a general lack of effort on the senate’s part.</p>\n<p>“I feel like a lot of people here … haven’t been doing the job with the power they were given to do this. They’re not holding office hours … they’re not going to the meetings and getting involved and taking students’ voices into account,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>Several senators brought up concerns with the ambiguity of the bill. According to Off-Campus Senator Alessandra Cianni, the provisions of the bill will not necessarily lead to the desired effect.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel like this bill does what it says it’s going to,” Cianni said. “It doesn’t feel like a transparency issue … I just feel like we already do this each quarter with [applications for] honoraria.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Kyley Scarlet said she would like to see more clarification of what particular information would be required on the evaluation form before making a decision on the bill.</p>\n<p>“I personally don’t feel comfortable passing something when I don’t know what it’s going to look like,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>Senators voted to hold a twenty-minute working meeting, in which they could offer their suggestions for the bill without adhering to the formal meeting procedures. During that time, Sommers discussed the language of the bill in order to clear up some of its more vague pronouncements. Senators passed the revised bill in an 18 to 3 vote.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed the progress of the proposed taxicab program, which would allow UCSB students to charge cab fares to their BARC accounts. External Vice President of Local Affairs Rhandy Siordia, who spearheaded the project, said the next step in the process will be choosing a company to partner with.</p>\n<p>“We’re at the point now where we can put a bid packet together and subsequently choose a taxi company,” Siordia said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also approved a motion to push back the start of their weekly meetings from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in order to better accommodate Senators’ class schedules.</p>\n<p>After adjourning last night’s meeting, Senators went into a closed meeting for an hour. The meeting’s purpose was to discuss personal matters and reduce some of the negativity and contention that has been building among senators over the last few weeks.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 21st 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Benjamin Pu/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50271\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50271\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/","id":3081,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3080,3079,3078],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard","biography":"Not available","articles":[3010,3012,3020,3021,3027,3029,3038,3040,3043,3050,3058,3060,3061,3071,3072,3074,3076,3078,3079,3081,3085,3087,3089,3092,3098,3102,3104,3106,3107,3108,3109,3111,3112,3113,3115,3116,3117,6138],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Legal Code. Under Legal code, a simple majority is 50 percent of Senators plus one, not counting abstentions — meaning that passage of the resolution would have required a “yes” vote from 13 of the 23 senators present (rounded up from 12.5).</p>\n<p>Authors of the resolution said they sought to incorporate critiques of the original document — “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid” — in their revisions and hoped that Senators would note the changes. University Owned Senator Miya Sommers said she believed the revisions made the resolution more neutral and less divisively worded.</p>\n<p>“This resolution — there’s a lot of changes into it. We definitely took all of the criticisms,” Sommers said. “This resolution is not taking sides; it’s not saying that we have an idea of what we want to happen around the issue. We, instead, are just asking for our school to not be involved.”</p>\n<p>Student sponsor and third-year political science major Katlen Abuata said the resolution did not intend to attack Israel itself but instead aimed to pressure the state to end certain policies.</p>\n<p>“What we’re doing here is not questioning the existence of Israel because we don’t want to do that at all. We don’t delegitimize the state of Israel,” Abuata said. “We are asking you to recognize that there are human rights violations and that there are students on this campus who feel uncomfortable with that.”</p>\n<p>Anti-divestment speaker Liran Braude said he did not believe the underlying intent of the resolution changed with the revisions.</p>\n<p>“This has become more than a little bit ridiculous,” Braude said. “The entire student body’s resources, time and money are being spent so that one group can attempt to force their own personal political complaint on the Senate, at the expense of another group on campus. The bottom line of this resolution has not changed at all.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Ben Green said he rejected the idea of the resolution’s “neutrality.”</p>\n<p>“It keeps being said that this isn’t taking a stance, and that this won’t be alienating people,” Green said. “It creates a controversial issue and a climate where people don’t feel safe.”</p>\n<p>Senators also touched on a number of arguments discussed in previous meetings such as impact of the decision on the campus climate, which communities would feel marginalized and what financial impact the resolution would have on UCSB. Following a heated debate over what constitutes a majority vote, Segovia announced her decision in tears, apologizing to anyone who would feel hurt by the defeat.</p>\n<p>In response, A.S. President Sophia Armen encouraged students to maintain civility when deliberating on sensitive issues.</p>\n<p>“We’re all still people, we’re all still students and it’s disheartening to see how much anger, how much pain, can be inflicted on each other,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Senators also began a discussion on the budget for the 2013-2014 school year, which was tabled last week due to a controversial vote on the divestment issue and was supposed to be finalized by the end of Wednesday’s meeting. Members of the Queer Commission, Human Rights Board, A.S. Food Bank and other groups presented defenses for funding requests, but the Senate ultimately decided to extend the budget deadline for one more week in order to more thoroughly examine each Board, Committee and Commission request.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1649098816\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51321\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51323\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/a-s-senate-meeting-fails-to-pass-revised-divestment-resolution-with-close-votes/as_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51323\" alt=\"AS_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A.S.

Senators proved responsive to students who lobbied at the meeting, adhering more closely to requests from student groups who spoke in public forum such as Queer Commission and Womyn’s Commission.</p>\n<p>For most allocations, Senators allocated an amount of the funds between the proposed budgets of A.S. Finance Board and the A.S. President. However, the organizations S.C.O.R.E., S.I.R.R.C., Student Lobby and Human Rights Board were given more money than either Finance Board or the President suggested.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed revisions to the A.S. Election Code, as well as the legality of Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia’s interpretation of the legal code at last week’s meeting regarding divestment from companies that profit from the military occupation of Palestine.</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Co-Chair Mariam Agazaryan addressed public forum in defense of the organization’s requested allocations. Agazaryan said she was disheartened by the substantial cuts made to all of the Boards, Committees, and Commissions as opposed to other entities in light of the budget restrictions.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a little bit ridiculous that BCCs are bearing the brunt of it,” Agazaryan said. “Senate, you hold a lot of power, but again, the BCCs is where it’s at.”</p>\n<p>Queer commission member James Neally said the need for increased LGBTQ education within the UCSB community is critical, especially in regards to the current campus climate.</p>\n<p>“Everything that Queer Commission does is very important to all the students here,” Neally said. “Even today there’s problems with people on our campus and a lot of education that needs to be done still.”</p>\n<p>Representatives from both Queer Commission and Womyn’s commission pointed towards the annual publication of Herstory! — a magazine that aims to give a voice to underrepresented minorities — as an important budget item.</p>\n<p>Representatives from various other organizations also presented in defense of their budget requests during public forum including the Student Commission on Racial Equality, Rally Commission, the Offices of the Student Advocate General and the External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and Take Back the Night.</p>\n<p>Senators spent several hours discussing each item on the budget individually, and eventually reached a consensus, which was approved at 6:02 a.m.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Senators also touched on the AFSCME protest of the Regents Meeting, the Elections code, and whether or not Segovia had acted in accordance with the legal code when she decided that 12 votes did not constitute enough of a majority for last week’s divestment resolution to pass.

If passed, the money would go toward providing new equipment, more content and covering of travel costs. The fee, which is one of two new A.S. lock-in fees being voted on this election, would go into effect next fall and be subject to reaffirmation every two years.</p>\n<p>Domenighini said the lock-in fee might also allow for more compensation for writers and editors to offset recent pay cuts.</p>\n<p>“One of our biggest setbacks is that we had to considerably reduce the amount of money that staff members are being paid,” Domenighini said. “So every staff member saw their paychecks go down very considerably. Editors had … the amount of money that they’re making reduced by over half.”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez, TBL was allocated $12,000 from A.S. for honoraria earlier this year, and covers a large portion of its printing costs through grants the staff applied for. However, Martinez said some of these grants may not be available next year, and the paper needs a more stable source of funding in order to continue to cover costs.</p>\n<p>Though the fee initiative failed to pass last year, Domenighini and Executive Content Editor Kelsey Gripenstraw said they remain confident it will pass this year, considering it fell short of the necessary 50 percent majority of 7,100 voters by only a couple hundred votes.</p>\n<p>“Our promotional campaign … wasn’t as strong as previous years,” Domenighini said. “Last year we really ramped that up, so I think the number one factor that we were facing last year was just that people didn’t really know who we were, so they were probably voting for a lock-in fee [when] they didn’t really know, exactly, what the publication was going through.”</p>\n<p>According to Gripenstraw, TBL’s weekly publication is not likely to change regardless of whether or not the initiative passes, but they may be forced to work with less if the measure fails. However, she said having more than one campus news source is important for the university and their readership.</p>\n<p>“We value having multiple media sources on campus, because think about how the United States would be if there was one source of media. It would be insane,” Gripenstraw said. “Like, you can’t just rely on one news source for the entire school, especially with a school as huge as UCSB. So we’re here just to provide another voice.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6> A version of this article appeared on page 10 of the April 18th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/tbl-continues-campaign-for-student-lock-in-fee/","id":3080,"author":{"id":181,"name":"Daniel Slovinsky"},"related":[3079,3078,3077],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
