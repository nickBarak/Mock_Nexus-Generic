President Brooke Kopel had <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-30/vacant-judicial-council-seats-filled-nine-weeks-after-quarter-begins/\">appointed</a> four members to the council after <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/a-s-postpones-council-vote-for-second-week/\">concerns</a> about conflicts of interest plagued her choice for the position of chair, current council member Justin Nilsen.</p>\n<p>According to Alonso, the council internally determined that Alonso was the best decision for chair.</p>\n<p>Alonso spoke about his plans for the position of chair at Wednesday’s meeting and in an interview with the Nexus, highlighting his interest in “broadening the accessibility of Judicial Council.”</p>\n<p>He plans to do so in two ways: by reaching out to various boards, commissions and units (BCUs) on campus and by introducing more empathy in judicial council proceedings.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to the judicial process, what often gets left out are the struggles of individuals from various communities, and that allows other people to misinterpret or misunderstand the decisions of other individuals that may have made necessary a judicial council case,” he said in the interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>“I want to do this in order to really give people who might not be as easily understood the ability to be understood.”</p>\n<p>He noted that, while the council is “alright, in terms of a diverse body,” there is always more that can be done to make the judicial process more equitable.</p>\n<p>Alonso said he also wants to work with various BCUs to increase their involvement and understanding of A.S. Legal Code, and wants to encourage them to reach out to the council if they have any concerns about legal code violations.</p>\n<p>“Almost every body of Associated Students violates legal code, accidentally, or on purpose, but usually accidentally. We want to make ourselves known to other people, like hey, if something is happening in your BCU which violates legal code and you don’t like this, we have legal code for a reason, and that’s something that you can come to us about,” he added.</p>\n<p>By gaining a better understanding of A.S. Legal Code, organizations can operate in the most efficient manner, Alonso said, which is his ultimate goal with the Council.</p>\n<p>“I’ve gone to a few BCU meetings myself, the bodies are great, and they have these brilliant missions, but because they aren’t super informed on legal code, they get stuck in a lot of… bureaucratic red tape,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It just really paralyzes action, and I want people to have the best understanding of legal code because it was designed very specifically to allow A.S. to function, not to prevent it from functioning.”</p>\n<p>Speaking to the Senate Wednesday evening, Alonso fielded questions about how he would address conflicts of interest and potential biases that could crop up.</p>\n<p>In response, Alonso affirmed that he was committed to transparency, both amongst council members and from himself. Alonso also noted that last spring, when the council encountered a case where he had a conflict of interest, he immediately recused himself from the discussion.</p>\n<p>Alonso also said the council has been discussing possible bias trainings that they could undergo in order to make the judicial proceedings as fair and understanding as they can be.</p>\n<p>Internally, Alonso plans on revamping the Council’s office space in order for them to be able to hear cases in their office, instead of spending the bulk of their minimal budget on renting out spaces to hear cases.</p>\n<p>He also plans to make the process of submitting a petition more clear by creating a Google form with mandatory questions, noting that petitions that were submitted last spring were bogged down with technicalities and are now being dealt with over six months later.</p>\n<p>Making the office as efficient as it can be is Alonso’s goal for his time as chair, but it’s also important to him to introduce an aspect of warmth to the proceedings.</p>\n<p>“It is important that all people within UCSB are able to feel safe and comfortable and know that the Association has their back.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 24, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at skamidi@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

However, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/zierer-drops-out-of-evpsa-election-ng-now-running-unopposed/\">Zierer dropped out of the race</a> on Wednesday morning, leaving Ng unopposed.</p>\n<p>The last student to hold the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/\">Kristin Hsu</a>, who focused much of her term on decreasing tuition during a time when the University of California Regents were threatening a tuition increase due to lack of state funding.</p>\n<p>If elected, Ng, a fourth-year global studies and biological sciences double major, plans to go in a different direction than Hsu.</p>\n<p>Ng hopes to center her agenda around statewide affairs as it concerns sexual assault policy, common sense gun control and reproductive justice.</p>\n<p>“I’m more interested in increasing the amount of resources we have on campus,” Ng said.</p>\n<p>One of her goals is to ensure that the newly created Survivor Resource Center in Isla Vista receives funding “in order to have the branch… be all that it can be.”</p>\n<p>“I really would be pushing for increased access to sexual assault resources,” Ng added.</p>\n<p>She also plans to advocate for stricter gun control policies, and was one of the organizers for Santa Barbara’s March for Our Lives.</p>\n<p>“I’m from Thousand Oaks,” Ng said. “It both personally touches me, and it’s also one of those things that shouldn’t be contentious.”</p>\n<p>Ng previously lobbied for <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/state-senator-reintroduces-bill-to-ensure-medication-abortion-access-at-public-universities/\">Senate Bill 24</a>, formerly Senate Bill 320, which would require all public university campuses, including UC Santa Barbara, to provide access to medication abortion services to students.</p>\n<p>“We luckily now have a governor who’s willing to pass it, so I’ve been really advocating for that,” Ng said.</p>\n<p>In terms of the EVPSA’s job to represent the student body on larger platforms, Ng believes that UCSB deserves a stronger voice in both the United States Student Association (USSA) and the University of California Student Association (UCSA).</p>\n<p>“We fund the vast majority of both of those entities,” Ng said. “If we’re the ones funding a lot of it, that means UC Santa Barbara should be up there with a really loud voice.”</p>\n<p>If elected, Ng plans to attend every A.S. Senate meeting to inform senators of relevant legislation.</p>\n<p>Ng started out her first year at UCSB involved in the Residential Housing Association as a Project Care Director.</p>\n<p>In her second year, Ng was an officer of Los Curanderos, which is a pre-med club on campus that is meant to focus on “disadvantaged communities who don’t have access to equal healthcare.”</p>\n<p>At the beginning of her third year, she joined the Associated Students (A.S.)

If the election meets the eight percent threshold, Ng will only serve for approximately three months until the winner of the Spring Quarter 2019 election is sworn in.</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.3 of the Jan. 24, 2019 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Simren Verma is the university news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or simren@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Senators Andrew Neiman and Jimmy Villarreal authored the bill in order to combat “excessive expenditures on food at meetings,” and stipulated that groups will only be able to spend money on food for events or programs, quarterly banquets and meetings with attendance exceeding 75 people.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Navkiran Kaur, who sat on the senate last year, was the first student to present at public forum in opposition to the bill. According to Kaur, restricting food budgets will hurt low-income students who depend on free food from the organizations.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students, with their meetings and classes and all the things that they do, don’t even have time for meals and I think it’s the least A.S. can do with their own student fees to provide a couple of snacks for students during meetings,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>While saying it is “really inappropriate” to limit food, particularly for low-income students, Kaur called the bill “classist” and said it “definitely screwed over a lot of students who depend on these meals.” She also brought up the question of whether or not the bill would affect the A.S. Food Bank, whose specific goal is to provide food for those who cannot afford it otherwise.</p>\n<p>Several members of A.S. Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) also came to public forum in order to contest the bill. One member discussed the bi-quarterly dinner that C.A.B. provides for children of UCSB students, saying they wondered if the organization would still be able to provide it with the restriction. PR Coordinator Kari Newman said 75 to 90 percent of new members come to meetings for the food, and that C.A.B. even uses the hook “great food, great friends” while tabling to attract participation.</p>\n<p>Co-chair Kaitlyn Christianson, who also sat on the senate last year, echoed the idea that food was a main attraction for participation at meetings. She said although students may initially come for the food, they oftentimes find opportunities for community involvement and actually take part in campus organizations. Additionally, Christianson made the argument that since C.A.B. uses the Isla Vista Food Co-op for food, the money they spend goes back towards the community.</p>\n<p>Senators did not devote much time to discussing the food bill, however they did establish an ad hoc committee to look into the concerns that were presented at public forum. Senator Arezu Hashemi said she acknowledged the necessity of discussing the bill.</p>\n<p>“I think that this is a good discussion to have,” Hashemi said. “If we want to talk about it on our own, I think that we should make an ad hoc for it — that way the BCCs can get involved.”</p>\n<p>During the Bills and Resolutions portion of the meeting, senators passed changes to the A.S. Elections code. Last year, changes to elections code consumed the senate for weeks, resulting in meetings that lasted 10 to 12 hours, during which senators debated, voted, were vetoed by the A.S. President and then voted to overturn the presidential veto. This year, elections code passed by consent, meaning that not a single senator objected to the changes.</p>\n<p>The most significant changes to the elections code include allowing independent candidates to spend an additional $100 on their campaigns as compared with last year, and extending the recruitment period for elections from two weeks to three weeks. Otherwise, the code remains relatively unchanged.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, Executive Officers delivered reports during which External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Alex Choate reported on the progress being made towards establishing more online courses, and Senators passed a bill establishing an official A.S. logo.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53817\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53817\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/","id":3040,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3039,3038,3037],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Representatives from the Student Commission on Racial Equality and the Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs also gave presentations on ongoing projects, in addition to the discussion of other issues and projects, such as a Bone Thugs-n-Harmony concert that will be held at the Hub on Mar. 6.</p>\n<p>In regard to the marijuana legalization debate, Senators decided to revisit discussion on the bill near the end of the meeting after it had already been passed without deliberation. This discussion incited passionate exchanges on both sides of the issue, with Senators Andre Theus, Amir Khazhaeli, Nick Onyshko, and Montana MacLachlan voicing opposition to the bill. Khazaieli said he feared the bill would reflect badly on UCSB’s reputation.</p>\n<p>“As representatives of the entire student body, taking a stance like this is completely counteractive to the whole notion of promoting UCSB as not a party school, not an ‘OK, get high and not care about anything,’” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Taylor supported the bill, and referred to a position supported by Assemblymember Das Williams, and he argued that one potential benefit of legalization would be the reduction of violence and profits connected to transnational drug cartels.</p>\n<p>“If the taxation happens and we legalize it, that could be taking money out of drug cartels,” Taylor said. “If there is a legalization and it’s going towards a good cause, not only will it be going towards benefiting higher education, but it could be a pipeline to stopping certain drug cartel interactions.”</p>\n<p>At one point, it was revealed that the entire Senate body lacked some knowledge on the legal status of marijuana in the state, when Off-Campus Senator Nick Onyshko asked the question to all senators of whether marijuana was decriminalized in California and did not receive an accurate response until a fellow senator researched the issue.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus, who opposed the bill, said he was frustrated with his fellow senators’ conduct shortly after the confusion.</p>\n<p>“I am extremely, extremely … disappointed with my Senate tonight,” Theus said. “People in this room don’t even know what the current rates are for a misdemeanor or what the actual revenue’s going to bring in … I think we need to bring that back to the Senate, with all of us being educated on the issues of the agenda.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Montana MacLachlan said she agreed with Theus regarding the Senate’s actions, and added her own personal sentiment.</p>\n<p>“I’m pissed,” MacLachlan said. “I feel very personally offended.”</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, Student Commission on Racial Equality co-chair Hani Tajsar gave a presentation to the Senate regarding the Facing Race Conference that will be held at the SRB on Feb. 22nd. The event seeks to educate students on issues that affect students of color, and anyone who attends will receive a free S.C.O.R.E. t-shirt and free tacos.</p>\n<p>Tajsar also advocated student action that would continue and improve efforts to recruit and help undocumented and low-income students graduate at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The recruitment and retention rate for undocumented students and low-income students in general, is something that I’m ashamed of … and we should all push for a better system,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore gave a presentation on the controversial proposal for a new development in Isla Vista, which would be located at the current site of the bar Dublin’s at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero del Mar. The four-story building, called The Nest has received much criticism from students, according to Moore, which is why he plans to work against the project.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, I’m representing student opinions,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Other items discussed during the meeting included the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony concert to be held on Mar. 6, as well as updates from Erick Lankey about promoting food insecurity awareness through the A.S. Food Bank, a progress report on the petition being distributed by the UCen S.U.R.F. initiative and updates on a leadership conference hosted by the Office of Student Life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[<em>Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Senator Amir Khazaieli led the opposition, while in fact multiple senators opposed the bill. In addition, it was wrongly stated that Senator Montana MacLachlan disagreed with Senator Andre Theus when in fact she agreed with his frustration with the Senate. The article has been updated to incorporate these corrections.</em>]</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54043\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54043\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-14/a-s-senate-debates-marijuana-legalization-bill-other-issues/","id":3041,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[3040,3039,3038],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
