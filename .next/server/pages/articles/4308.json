His controversial, often profane communications with his residents are frequently caught on video and published on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November, Gelb was charged with a misdemeanor after he was filmed hurling a barrage of homophobic slurs at I.V. Community Services District President Ethan Bertrand on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The video shows Gelb repeatedly calling Bertrand a “fag” and making lewd references to anal sex after Bertrand had told him that he treats his residents poorly. Bertrand, who is openly gay, serves on the I.V. CSD Board of Directors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident received considerable local media coverage and Gelb faced widespread community backlash. Gelb issued a statement in response, attributing his lack of filter to Asperger’s Syndrome and accusing Bertrand of calling him a “pedophile” and a “felon” before the video began — a claim Bertrand has since denied.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Days later, Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley announced the county would charge Gelb with one count of disturbing the peace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Gelb’s arraignment has been continually delayed. He has not been present at any of the hearings. In February, his representation unsuccessfully filed to have the case dismissed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a Facebook group titled “Texts From Gelb,” I.V. residents share videos of Gelb’s public outbursts and screenshots of profane texts he had sent them. On Saturday, a user posted a video of Gelb using misogynistic slurs to tell residents not to sit on the roof of their complex. He also refers to the apparent sale of his properties, which he had been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/isla-vista-landlord-leaving-del-playa-drive-after-23-years-lists-properties-for-80-mil/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pursuing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t need these fucking cunts falling off my roof, ruining my sale,” he says at one point in the video. “Tell that fucking whore to get off my goddamn roof!” he shouts at another. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gelb declined the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s request for comment on the video.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand said he was frustrated the process has taken so long, but he won’t be deterred from seeing it through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ll continue to show up to these hearings for as long as I need to,” Bertrand told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “It’s important that when there’s an attack on members of the LGBTQ community, we stand up and say, ‘This is not acceptable.’” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-20/i-v-landlord-gelbs-arraignment-repeatedly-postponed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-20/i-v-landlord-gelbs-arraignment-repeatedly-postponed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-20/i-v-landlord-gelbs-arraignment-repeatedly-postponed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-20/i-v-landlord-gelbs-arraignment-repeatedly-postponed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-20/i-v-landlord-gelbs-arraignment-repeatedly-postponed/","id":4308,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[4307,4306,4305],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee","biography":"Not available","articles":[2279,2302,2305,2319,2335,2884,3648,3726,3735,3748,3754,3758,3930,3931,3944,3947,3968,4295,4305,4308,4327,4334,4340,4811],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Student Sets Up Bitcoin ATM at I.V.

Currently, the machine is the only bitcoin ATM in Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blaufuss co-founded the bitcoin ATM company Coind LLC with a hometown friend. They funded the startup costs themselves, confident that the ATMs would provide a steady cash flow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, it has proven noticeable. I.V. Deli Mart customers frequently stop to examine it, mostly out of curiosity, said Deli Mart owner Michael Hassan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people come in and look at it and say, ‘Oh look, bitcoin!’” Hassan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But not too many I.V. residents have actually bought in. Blaufuss estimated the machine gets about two to three purchases a day — each worth about $300. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its invention in 2009, bitcoin’s popularity has steadily climbed through internet word-of-mouth. Its major selling point is that transactions are encrypted and decentralized, which means it can’t be easily stolen and central banks can’t track the exchanges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATMs provide another platform for people to obtain the currency, complementing online exchanges like Coinbase. The ATM in I.V. allows only purchases; withdrawals must be carried out online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is valued at more than $7,000 per coin as of Saturday, but the amount is strikingly volatile and can sharply rise or decline from day to day. The currency is so speculative that even a single piece of bad news can lead to bitcoin owners dumping and ditching their share of the market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In just the past four months, the value has plummeted from a </span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-hits-new-record-high-as-warnings-grow-louder-idUSKBN1E919T\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record high</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of nearly $18,000, after news broke that foreign governments are attempting to </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/05/bitcoin-drops-more-than-14-percent-to-below-7000.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">add regulations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cryptocurrency transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even Blaufuss has sold all of his bitcoins, though he noted that the value may rebound just as quickly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The market right now is just trash,” he said. “Everything is in the gutter. I’ve sold everything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But it’s a good time to buy right now, because everything is so cheap,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ATMs have picked up steam after a slow start, said James Forshaw, Blaufuss’ friend and company co-founder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“College students are a lot more aware of bitcoin and how to use it,” Forshaw said. He and Blaufuss have set up another ATM in Agoura Hills and plan to place one in Oxnard in the near future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATM customers don’t have to buy one whole coin every time — since the currency is digital, it can be broken down into fractional amounts that run as many as eight decimal places.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporters laud the currency as a future competition to the dollar, given how little encryption and how much oversight currently exists for dollar transactions. But critics have dismissed the currency, calling its popularity a </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/bitcoin-bubble/547952/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get-rich-quick bubble</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and comparing it unfavorably with more stable cryptocurrencies like ethereum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blaufuss noted in a Facebook post earlier this month that his company would consider adding ethereum to the ATM’s selections.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The enthusiasm behind cryptocurrency is buoyed by a faith that society will one day value encrypted transactions as a serious alternative to trading legal tender. Blaufuss didn’t commit to a philosophical stance, but he does believe the ATM will be successful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make it as quick, easy and painless as possible,” Blaufuss said. “And you won’t have to worry about giving your credit card information to companies that can later be hacked. It’s the safest way possible.”    </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

SBSO</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, aimed at curbing the number of citations issued in Isla Vista, allows residents who have violated one of three ordinances — ordinance 36-2, consuming alcohol in public; 36-3, having an open container; or 40-2, playing loud music outside of curfew hours — the chance to wipe the violations from their permanent record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, which </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/foot-patrol-to-launch-restorative-justice-program-offering-alternative-punishment-for-ordinance-violators/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launched</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> officially on Oct. 4, was advertised as a way to create a “bridge between law enforcement and the community” — the same sentiment that has been advertised in other programs Schroeder has created since taking the position of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/foot-patrol-welcomes-new-i-v-community-resource-deputy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista’s community resource deputy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in December 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents must attend a class, typically taught by Schroeder and members of the UC Santa Barbara Police Department, and perform a number of community service hours. Guest speakers are also invited to talk to residents about the impact their actions have on others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting from the program’s launch on Oct. 4 to Jan. 6, 58 people received citations for one of the three violations listed above. Of the 58 people, 49 signed up to attend the class; 31 have finished the classes but have not yet completed the community service portion, according to Schroeder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw a huge peak [in attendance] when it first launched, which was right before Halloween,” Schroeder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that there was a “significant drop” during UC Santa Barbara’s winter break, a period in which most students leave Isla Vista for the three-week gap between quarters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to be eligible to have a citation waived, residents must register for the program in person at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol and have to complete the classes themselves within 90 days. Schroeder hopes to launch an app in the near future that would allow residents to sign up using their smartphones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The typical class is two hours long and begins with a brief history of Isla Vista, discussing more “high-profile” incidents that newer students may not know about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees also are guided through an interactive activity, in which they attempt to solve a community problem. Schroeder and guest speakers also explain why certain policies are in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that they additionally go into “how people can make safer choices when using alcohol and drugs — not necessarily telling them not to do it, but how to do it safely.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, it has been a “mostly good mix” of UCSB and Santa Barbara City College students attending the classes, Schroeder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three classes have been held so far, and the typical class sees between 15 and 20 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schroeder also noted that citations issued in Isla Vista are down 50% from last year, a fact he attributed in part to Isla Vista outreach programs, such as the</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Party Registration Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which launched last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not lecturing these people — we really are trying to work with them to make sure crimes are reduced in the future. They’re part of the group solving the solutions,” he noted. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

house party on Del Playa with a friend in a sorority, who the user said was pulled aside by a Sigma Nu fraternity member. <em> Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident was first </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/exb9tr/sigma_nu_is_disgusting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about to r/UCSantaBarbara, a subreddit for the UC Santa Barbara community, and was soon shared on various other UCSB social media spaces as well, including the Free &amp; For Sale group on Facebook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Reddit post, the user wrote about attending a Sigma Nu house party on Del Playa with a friend in a sorority, who the user said was pulled aside by a Sigma Nu fraternity member. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He asked her if “her friend in the red(me) Is a [transgender woman] because someone at the door let a [transgender woman] in” and it was his job to go find her. My friend said no she’s not and that’s so fucked up [of] u guys to even ask,” the user wrote, referencing the slur that the fraternity member allegedly used to refer to a transgender woman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then he apologized and showed her the SNU group [messages] where someone had asked “who the fuck let that [transgender woman] in” and something along the lines of “kick her out” then he replied saying “I found a girl I thought was her but she’s not it. I’ll keep searching”.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reddit user who posted about the incident did not respond to a message from a Nexus reporter asking for further information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students President Alison Sir was the first to bring up the post at the meeting on Monday, noting that many students had approached her over the weekend about the post. Sir asked Interfraternity Council President Jason Stone what the council was doing to address the complaints. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not actually aware of the details of that, but generally speaking, with regard to discrimination, it’s something we take seriously,” Stone said. “I’m absolutely ready to visit that as I’m able to understand that situation, but I’m not really aware of it right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, acting associate dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL), added that “notably our Greek leader retreat occurred this past weekend, so several leaders in the Greek community were actually not in Isla Vista during the weekend, so there’s some communication delay.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said his office had been notified about the post and had started to look into it, but was not aware of the poster’s identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alvarez stepped in to say that the Title IX office had also received a report about the incident, and had reached out to the user who made the Reddit post. She did not specify who made the report to the Title IX office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve received some data and screenshots of some group chats so that is data we’re collecting, and we are trying to figure out what additional information is available and figure out next steps in our response,” Alvarez told the room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the office feels like it has enough information to move forward, Alvarez said it will conduct an assessment to see if the report falls underneath either the nondiscrimination policy or the Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it doesn’t meet the criteria under those two policies, I’m unable to take action, but I will forward it then over to the Office of Student Life to potentially take action under additional codes,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead said in an interview afterward that her office and several other offices had started looking into the incident, but since the only formal report was made to the Title IX office, that office is now in charge of the investigation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock said at the meeting, however, that it’s difficult for the office to issue any disciplinary action in response to “speech infractions.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Generally, even the most offensive speech is permitted by the law, and therefore [permitted by] our policy as a government organization,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So we wind up in a position where we may not be able to hold a person accountable in terms of a change to their student status or a formal warning or something like that, but we do still have the opportunity as an institution to express our values, express our concern, to offer the voluntary education,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intersectional Feminists President Kyremina Youssef touched upon the incident in a later discussion during the meeting about timely notifications to the community, saying that while many students had seen the post circulating on social media, they hadn’t heard anything from administrators.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said she and others wanted to see a statement from UCSB administrators in support of transgender students and offering resources to those affected by the post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like students are just waiting on UC administration to say something,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said after the meeting that while she believes it’s important to “let the student body know how we feel about this and our values,” a statement from the university would likely come in her monthly newsletter as opposed to a campus-wide email from the chancellor’s office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so frustrating, when this happens,” Armistead said. “It’s just so against our values, and it’s hurtful. We definitely can have some more conversations with all of our organizations to make sure that they’re inclusive, and that’s definitely something I’ll be proactive with.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
